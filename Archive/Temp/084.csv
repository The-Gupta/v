To combine the virtues of both approaches, we equipped LeGO vectors encoding red, green or blue fluorescent proteins with complex DNA barcodes carrying color-specific signatures. For these vectors, we generated highly complex plasmid libraries that were used for the production of barcoded lentiviral vector particles. In proof-of-principle experiments, we used barcoded vectors for RGB marking of cell lines and primary murine hepatocytes. We applied single-cell polymerase chain reaction to decipher barcode signatures of individual RGB-marked cells expressing defined color hues. This enabled us to prove clonal identity of cells with one and the same RGB color. Also, we made use of barcoded vectors to investigate clonal development of leukemia induced by ectopic oncogene expression in murine hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, by combining RGB marking and DNA barcoding, we have established a novel technique for the unambiguous genetic marking of individual cells in the context of normal regeneration as well as malignant outgrowth. Moreover, the introduction of color-specific signatures in barcodes will facilitate studies on the impact of different variables (e.g. vector type, transgenes, culture conditions) in the context of competitive repopulation studies.","['Cornils, Kerstin', 'Thielecke, Lars', 'Huser, Svenja', 'Forgber, Michael', 'Thomaschewski, Michael', 'Kleist, Nadja', 'Hussein, Kais', 'Riecken, Kristoffer', 'Volz, Tassilo', 'Gerdes, Sebastian', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'Dahl, Andreas', 'Dandri, Maura', 'Roeder, Ingo', 'Fehse, Boris']","['Cornils K', 'Thielecke L', 'Huser S', 'Forgber M', 'Thomaschewski M', 'Kleist N', 'Hussein K', 'Riecken K', 'Volz T', 'Gerdes S', 'Glauche I', 'Dahl A', 'Dandri M', 'Roeder I', 'Fehse B']","['Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, Hamburg 20246, Germany, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden 01307, Germany, ALS Automated Lab Solutions GmbH, Jena 07747, Germany, Department of Neuropathology, Hannover Medical School, Institute of Pathology, Hannover 30625, Germany, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg 20246, Germany, Deep Sequencing Group SFB 655, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden 01307, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140129,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, trkA/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC3985654,2014/01/31 06:00,2014/07/09 06:00,['2014/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['gku081 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku081 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Apr;42(7):e56. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku081.

This reprogramming does not require nuclear transfer or genetic manipulation. Here we report that reprogrammed STAP cells, unlike embryonic stem (ES) cells, can contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues, as seen in a blastocyst injection assay. Mouse STAP cells lose the ability to contribute to the placenta as well as trophoblast marker expression on converting into ES-like stem cells by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In contrast, when cultured with Fgf4, STAP cells give rise to proliferative stem cells with enhanced trophoblastic characteristics. Notably, unlike conventional trophoblast stem cells, the Fgf4-induced stem cells from STAP cells contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues in vivo and transform into ES-like cells when cultured with LIF-containing medium. Taken together, the developmental potential of STAP cells, shown by chimaera formation and in vitro cell conversion, indicates that they represent a unique state of pluripotency.","['Obokata, Haruko', 'Sasai, Yoshiki', 'Niwa, Hitoshi', 'Kadota, Mitsutaka', 'Andrabi, Munazah', 'Takata, Nozomu', 'Tokoro, Mikiko', 'Terashita, Yukari', 'Yonemura, Shigenobu', 'Vacanti, Charles A', 'Wakayama, Teruhiko']","['Obokata H', 'Sasai Y', 'Niwa H', 'Kadota M', 'Andrabi M', 'Takata N', 'Tokoro M', 'Terashita Y', 'Yonemura S', 'Vacanti CA', 'Wakayama T']","[""1] Laboratory for Cellular Reprogramming, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan [2] Laboratory for Genomic Reprogramming, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan [3] Laboratory for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."", 'Laboratory for Organogenesis and Neurogenesis, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Pluripotent Stem Cell Studies, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', 'Genome Resource and Analysis Unit, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', 'Genome Resource and Analysis Unit, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Organogenesis and Neurogenesis, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Genomic Reprogramming, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', '1] Laboratory for Cellular Reprogramming, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan [2] Laboratory for Genomic Reprogramming, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', 'Electron Microscopy Laboratory, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', ""Laboratory for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."", '1] Laboratory for Genomic Reprogramming, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan [2] Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Fgf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', '*Cellular Reprogramming/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 4/pharmacology', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Placenta/*cytology/drug effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/drug effects']",,2014/01/31 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2014/01/31 06:00'],"['2013/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['nature12969 [pii]', '10.1038/nature12969 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2014 Jan 30;505(7485):676-80. doi: 10.1038/nature12969.,"['Nature. 2014 Jan 30;505(7485):622-3.

Here we show that a novel Toll-like receptor (TLR-9) agonist C792 restores the ability of MM patient-pDCs to stimulate T-cell proliferation. Coculture of pDCs with MM cells induces MM cell growth; and importantly, C792 inhibits pDC-induced MM cell growth and triggers apoptosis. In contrast, treatment of either MM cells or pDCs alone with C792 does not affect the viability of either cell type. In agreement with our in vitro data, C792 inhibits pDC-induced MM cell growth in vivo in a murine xenograft model of human MM. Mechanistic studies show that C792 triggers maturation of pDCs, enhances interferon-alpha and interferon-lambda secretion and activates TLR-9/MyD88 signaling axis. Finally, C792 enhances the anti-MM activity of bortezomib, lenalidomide, SAHA or melphalan.

However, red blood cell transfusions lead to iron overload and subsequent organ damage because of the toxic effects of iron. The heart is particularly vulnerable to iron toxicity, and heart failure is the leading cause of death among these patients. Iron chelation therapy prevents or reverses iron loading, thereby reducing the risk of complications from excess iron. Serum ferritin and liver iron concentration often are used to gauge the risk of organ iron overload, but these measurements may not correlate well with cardiac iron load. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that can provide a more direct measure of iron concentration in both the heart and liver. Cardiac iron determined by MRI is expressed as a function of T2*, in which higher values represent lower concentrations. Changes in T2* are used to assess the effectiveness of iron chelation and to adjust therapy. Early treatment and compliance are keys to successful therapy. Nursing strategies to optimize chelation therapy include identifying patients who are at risk for developing organ damage, developing chelation plans, promoting compliance, and educating patients. The efficacy and safety of iron chelators, as well as nursing best practices, are reviewed.","['Carson, Susan M', 'Martin, Marie B']","['Carson SM', 'Martin MB']","['School of Nursing, University of California, Los Angeles.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin J Oncol Nurs,Clinical journal of oncology nursing,9705336,['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)'],,"['Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'beta-Thalassemia/*drug therapy']",,2014/01/31 06:00,2015/04/09 06:00,['2014/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['H647M14741306101 [pii]', '10.1188/14.CJON.102-111 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2014 Feb;18(1):102-11. doi: 10.1188/14.CJON.102-111.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic illnesses/comorbidities', 'fatigue', 'hematology', 'leukemia', 'lymphomas']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genotyping of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The odds ratios (ORs) of MTHFR genotypes were used to assess the associations of these polymorphisms with childhood ALL susceptibility. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed for frequencies of the 677CC, 677CT and 677TT genotypes between patients and controls. Frequencies of the 1298AA, 1298 AC and 1298CC genotypes between the two groups were significantly different. The risk of ALL with the 1298C allele carriers (AC + CC) was elevated by 1.1 times compared with the AA genotype [OR = 2.100; 95% CI (1.149; 3.837); P = 0.015]. CONCLUSIONS: The MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to childhood ALL in the Chinese population.","['Li, Xiaolei', 'Liao, Qingchuan', 'Zhang, Shunguo', 'Chen, Minling']","['Li X', 'Liao Q', 'Zhang S', 'Chen M']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1678 Dongfang Road, Pudong, Shanghai 200127, China. minling-chen@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140129,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Asians/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",PMC3932997,2014/01/31 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/01/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['2047-783X-19-5 [pii]', '10.1186/2047-783X-19-5 [doi]']",epublish,Eur J Med Res. 2014 Jan 29;19:5. doi: 10.1186/2047-783X-19-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that the function of Lgl is conserved in mammalian haematopoietic stem cells and implies a contribution to haematological malignancies. To date, direct measurement of the effect of Lgl expression on malignancies of the haematopoietic lineage has not been tested. In Lgl1(-)/(-) mice, we analysed the development of haematopoietic malignancies either alone, or in the presence of common oncogenic lesions. We show that in the absence of Lgl1, production of mature white blood cell lineages and long-term survival of mice are not affected. Additionally, loss of Lgl1 does not alter leukaemia driven by constitutive Notch, c-Myc or Jak2 signalling. These results suggest that the role of Lgl1 in the haematopoietic lineage might be restricted to specific co-operating mutations and a limited number of cellular contexts.","['Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Oliaro, Jane', 'Ramsbottom, Kelly M', 'Ting, Stephen B', 'Sacirbegovic, Faruk', 'Harvey, Michael', 'Kinwell, Tanja', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Humbert, Patrick O', 'Russell, Sarah M']","['Hawkins ED', 'Oliaro J', 'Ramsbottom KM', 'Ting SB', 'Sacirbegovic F', 'Harvey M', 'Kinwell T', 'Ghysdael J', 'Johnstone RW', 'Humbert PO', 'Russell SM']","['Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Stem Cell Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Cell Cycle and Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110 91405, Orsay, France ; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 3306, Orsay, France ; INSERM (Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale) U1005, Orsay, France.', 'Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Cell Cycle and Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Centre for Micro-Photonics, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140127,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Llgl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA Primers/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3903681,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0087376 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-43146 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 27;9(1):e87376. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0087376. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcomes of these cases are critically influenced by the transition from JAK2 (V617F) heterozygosity to homozygosity. Therefore, a technique providing an unbiased assessment of the critical allele burden, 50% JAK2 (V617F), is highly desirable. In this study, we present an approach to assess the JAK2 (V617F) burden from genomic DNA (gDNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA) using one-plus-one template references for allele-specific quantitative-real-time-PCR (qPCR). Plasmidic gDNA and cDNA constructs encompassing one PCR template for JAK2 (V617F) spaced from one template for JAK2(Wild Type) were constructed by multiple fusion PCR amplifications. Repeated assessments of the 50% JAK2(V617F) burden within the dynamic range of serial dilutions of gDNA and cDNA constructs resulted in 52.53 +/- 4.2% and 51.46 +/- 4.21%, respectively. The mutation-positive cutoff was estimated to be 3.65% (mean +2 standard deviation) using 20 samples from a healthy population. This qPCR approach was compared with the qualitative ARMS-PCR technique and with two standard methods based on qPCR, and highly significant correlations were obtained in all cases. qPCR assays were performed on paired gDNA/cDNA samples from 20 MPN patients, and the JAK2 (V617F) expression showed a significant correlation with the allele burden.

A synthetic gene encoding the RxPAL protein was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli TOP 10 in a soluble form with an N-terminal His6-tag and the recombinant RxPAL protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The activity assay of RxPAL with l-phenylalanine at various pH values exhibited a local maximum at pH 8.5 and a global maximum at pH 11.5. Circular dichroism (CD) studies showed that RxPAL is associated with an extensive alpha-helical character (far UV CD) and two distinctive near-UV CD peaks. These structural characteristics were well preserved up to pH 11.0. The extremely high pH optimum of RxPAL can be rationalized by a three-dimensional homology model indicating possible disulfide bridges, extensive salt-bridge formation and an excess of negative electrostatic potential on the surface. Due to these properties, RxPAL may be a candidate as biocatalyst in synthetic biotransformations leading to unnatural l- or d-amino acids or as therapeutic enzyme in treatment of phenylketonuria or leukemia.","['Kovacs, Klaudia', 'Banoczi, Gergely', 'Varga, Andrea', 'Szabo, Izabella', 'Holczinger, Andras', 'Hornyanszky, Gabor', 'Zagyva, Imre', 'Paizs, Csaba', 'Vertessy, Beata G', 'Poppe, Laszlo']","['Kovacs K', 'Banoczi G', 'Varga A', 'Szabo I', 'Holczinger A', 'Hornyanszky G', 'Zagyva I', 'Paizs C', 'Vertessy BG', 'Poppe L']","['Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary ; Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Biocatalysis Research Group, Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Biocatalysis Research Group, Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Applied Biotechnology and Food Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Biocatalysis Research Group, Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary ; Department of Applied Biotechnology and Food Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140127,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 4.3.1.24 (Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase)']",IM,"['Actinobacteria/*enzymology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'Species Specificity']",PMC3903478,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085943 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-36088 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 27;9(1):e85943. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085943. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to childhood ALL, survival for adults with ALL is poor. Recently, new protocols, including use of pediatric protocols in young adults, have improved survival in clinical trials. Here, we examine population level survival in Germany and the United States (US) to gain insight into the extent to which changes in clinical trials have translated into better survival on the population level. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in the US and 11 cancer registries in Germany. Patients age 15-69 diagnosed with ALL were included. Period analysis was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (RS). RESULTS: Overall 5-year RS was estimated at 43.4% for Germany and 35.5% for the US (p = 0.004), with a decrease in survival with increasing age. Survival was higher in Germany than the US for men (43.6% versus 37.7%, p = 0.002) but not for women (42.4% versus 40.3%, p>0.1). Five-year RS estimates increased in Germany and the US between 2002 and 2006 by 11.8 and 7.3 percent units, respectively (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Survival for adults with ALL continues to be low compared with that for children, but a substantial increase in 5-year survival estimates was seen from 2002 to 2006 in both Germany and the US. The reasons for the survival differences between both countries require clarification.","['Pulte, Dianne', 'Jansen, Lina', 'Gondos, Adam', 'Katalinic, Alexander', 'Barnes, Benjamin', 'Ressing, Meike', 'Holleczek, Bernd', 'Eberle, Andrea', 'Brenner, Hermann']","['Pulte D', 'Jansen L', 'Gondos A', 'Katalinic A', 'Barnes B', 'Ressing M', 'Holleczek B', 'Eberle A', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany ; Cardeza Foundation and Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'National Center for Cancer Registry Data, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Cancer Registry of Rhineland-Palatinate, Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Saarland Cancer Registry, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Cancer Registry of Bremen, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany ; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140127,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3903479,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085554 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-16076 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 27;9(1):e85554. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085554. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,['GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group'],"['Geiss K', 'Meyer M', 'Eberle A', 'Luttmann S', 'Stabenow R', 'Hentschel S', 'Nennecke A', 'Kieschke J', 'Sirri E', 'Holleczek B', 'Emrich K', 'Kajuter H', 'Mattauch V', 'Katalinic A', 'Barnes B', 'Kraywinkel K', 'Brenner H', 'Gondos A', 'Jansen L']","['Geiss, Karla', 'Meyer, Martin', 'Eberle, Andrea', 'Luttmann, Sabine', 'Stabenow, Roland', 'Hentschel, Stefan', 'Nennecke, Alice', 'Kieschke, Joachim', 'Sirri, Eunice', 'Holleczek, Bernd', 'Emrich, Katharina', 'Kajuter, Hiltraud', 'Mattauch, Volkmar', 'Katalinic, Alexander', 'Barnes, Benjamin', 'Kraywinkel, Klaus', 'Brenner, Hermann', 'Gondos, Adam', 'Jansen, Lina']",,,,,,,,,

Consistent with this, we found that PIMs are highly expressed in human hematologic cancers and show that each isoform has a distinct expression pattern among disease subtypes. This suggests that inhibitors of all three PIMs would be effective in treating multiple hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pan-PIM inhibitors have proven difficult to develop because PIM2 has a low Km for ATP and, thus, requires a very potent inhibitor to effectively block the kinase activity at the ATP levels in cells. We developed a potent and specific pan-PIM inhibitor, LGB321, which is active on PIM2 in the cellular context. RESULTS: LGB321 is active on PIM2-dependent multiple myeloma cell lines, where it inhibits proliferation, mTOR-C1 signaling and phosphorylation of BAD. Broad cancer cell line profiling of LGB321 demonstrates limited activity in cell lines derived from solid tumors. In contrast, significant activity in cell lines derived from diverse hematological lineages was observed, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Furthermore, we demonstrate LGB321 activity in the KG-1 AML xenograft model, in which modulation of pharmacodynamics markers is predictive of efficacy. Finally, we demonstrate that LGB321 synergizes with cytarabine in this model. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a potent and selective pan-PIM inhibitor with single-agent antiproliferative activity and show that it synergizes with cytarabine in an AML xenograft model. Our results strongly support the development of Pan-PIM inhibitors to treat hematologic malignancies.","['Garcia, Pablo D', 'Langowski, John L', 'Wang, Yingyun', 'Chen, Min', 'Castillo, Joseph', 'Fanton, Christie', 'Ison, Marjorie', 'Zavorotinskaya, Tatiana', 'Dai, Yumin', 'Lu, Jing', 'Niu, Xiao-Hong', 'Basham, Stephen', 'Chan, Julie', 'Yu, Jianjun', 'Doyle, Michael', 'Feucht, Paul', 'Warne, Robert', 'Narberes, Jamie', 'Tsang, Tiffany', 'Fritsch, Christine', 'Kauffmann, Audrey', 'Pfister, Estelle', 'Drueckes, Peter', 'Trappe, Joerg', 'Wilson, Christopher', 'Han, Wooseok', 'Lan, Jiong', 'Nishiguchi, Gisele', 'Lindvall, Mika', 'Bellamacina, Cornelia', 'Aycinena, J Alex', 'Zang, Richard', 'Holash, Jocelyn', 'Burger, Matthew T']","['Garcia PD', 'Langowski JL', 'Wang Y', 'Chen M', 'Castillo J', 'Fanton C', 'Ison M', 'Zavorotinskaya T', 'Dai Y', 'Lu J', 'Niu XH', 'Basham S', 'Chan J', 'Yu J', 'Doyle M', 'Feucht P', 'Warne R', 'Narberes J', 'Tsang T', 'Fritsch C', 'Kauffmann A', 'Pfister E', 'Drueckes P', 'Trappe J', 'Wilson C', 'Han W', 'Lan J', 'Nishiguchi G', 'Lindvall M', 'Bellamacina C', 'Aycinena JA', 'Zang R', 'Holash J', 'Burger MT']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Oncology Disease Area Research; Global Discovery Chemistry/Oncology and Exploratory Chemistry; MAP Group; Chemical and Pharmaceutical Profiling Group, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Emeryville, California; Developmental Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Oncology Disease Area Research; and Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140128,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-2062 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2062 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Apr 1;20(7):1834-45. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2062.

The aim of this study was to assess ASNS mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow cell populations of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Bone marrow mononuclear cells at diagnosis, day 33 of treatment, and after completion of chemotherapy were isolated and studied. ASNS mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR, and protein levels by Western blot. Our results indicate that MSC ASNS mRNA expression is upregulated in ALL samples compared to controls. ASNS expression of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) was found to be 2.3 times higher than that of blasts at diagnosis of ALL. We also observed that the values of the ASNS mRNA of MSC seem to reach a peak at diagnosis, and tend to decline with treatment. No correlation was found between the ASNS mRNA and protein levels. Chemotherapy does not exert any effect on the protein expression. Variability of asparaginase-induced effect may be attributable to factors involved in the interaction of hematopoietic cells with their microenvironment.","['Dimitriou, Helen', 'Choulaki, Christianna', 'Perdikogianni, Chryssoula', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Kalmanti, Maria']","['Dimitriou H', 'Choulaki C', 'Perdikogianni C', 'Stiakaki E', 'Kalmanti M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Medical School, University of Crete, PO 2208, 71003, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, lena@med.uoc.gr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140129,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/*genetics/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",,2014/01/30 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1509-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Mar;99(3):305-10. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1509-y.

However, only half of the patients who are treated will benefit from this treatment. It is a major challenge to predict which patients are likely to respond to treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of immunophenotyping for response to treatment with azacitidine of Int-2 and high risk MDS patients. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates were analyzed by flow cytometry in 42 patients with Int-2 and high risk MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia before treatment and after every third cycle of azacitidine. A flow score was calculated using the flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS). RESULTS: The presence of myeloid progenitors with an aberrant immunophenotype was significantly associated with lack of response (p = 0.02). A low pretreatment FCSS was associated with significantly better OS compared with a high pretreatment FCSS (p = 0.03). A significant decrease in FCSS was observed in patients with complete response after three cycles azacitidine compared to patients with progressive disease (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Absence of aberrant myeloid progenitor cells at baseline and/or a decrease in the FCSS during treatment identified Int-2 and high risk MDS patients who are likely to respond to treatment with azacitidine.","['Alhan, Canan', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'van der Helm, Lieke H', 'Eeltink, Corien', 'Huls, Gerwin', 'Witte, Birgit I', 'Buchi, Francesca', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Alhan C', 'Westers TM', 'van der Helm LH', 'Eeltink C', 'Huls G', 'Witte BI', 'Buchi F', 'Santini V', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, VU Institute of Cancer and Immunology (V-ICI), Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140128,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. The quality of studies was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between the NQO1 C609T polymorphisms and AML risk. A total of 14 studies including 2,245 cases and 3,310 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, significantly elevated AML risk was associated with NQO1 C609T variant genotypes when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (TT vs. CC: OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15-1.81; dominant model: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.09-1.68). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found for Asians (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.13-1.93, P = 0.005, I(2) = 48.4%, P = 0.071 for heterogeneity). When stratified by studies of adults or children, statistically significantly elevated risks were found among adults (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.06-1.76, P = 0.017, I(2) = 42.2%, P = 0.097 for heterogeneity). The accumulated evidence indicates that NQO1 C609T seems to confer a risk factor for AML among Asians and adults. Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed, thus more studies based on larger case-control population are required to further evaluate the role of NQO1 C609T polymorphism in AML.","['Li, Cuiping', 'Liu, Yun', 'Wei, Shujiao', 'Zhou, Yang']","['Li C', 'Liu Y', 'Wei S', 'Zhou Y']","[""School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20140129,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24924 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):771-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24924.

ATM-deficient (ATM(-/-)) mice exhibit hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction and a high incidence of lymphoma. Gadd45a controls cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair, and is involved in the ATM-p53 mediated DNA damage response. However, the role of Gadd45a in regulating the functionality of ATM(-/-) HSCs is unknown. Here we report that Gadd45a deletion did not rescue the defects of T-cells and B-cells development in ATM(-/-) mice. Instead, ATM and Gadd45a double knockout (ATM(-/-) Gadd45a(-/-)) HSCs exhibited an aggravated defect in long-term self-renewal capacity compared to ATM(-/-) HSCs in HSC transplantation experiments. Further experiments revealed that the aggravated defect of ATM(-/-) Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs was due to a reduction of cell proliferation, associated with an accumulation of DNA damage and subsequent activation of DNA damage response including an up-regulation of p53-p21 signaling pathway. Additionally, ATM(-/-) Gadd45a(-/-) mice showed an increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancies, as well as an increased rate of metastasis than ATM(-/-) mice. In conclusion, Gadd45a deletion aggravated the DNA damage accumulation, which subsequently resulted in a further impaired self-renewal capacity and an increased malignant transformation in ATM(-/-) HSCs.","['Chen, Yulin', 'Yang, Runan', 'Guo, Peng', 'Ju, Zhenyu']","['Chen Y', 'Yang R', 'Guo P', 'Ju Z']","['Institute of Aging Research, School of Medicine, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, 311121, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140129,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Gadd45a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC3938854,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/05/31 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13238-013-0017-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Cell. 2014 Jan;5(1):80-9. doi: 10.1007/s13238-013-0017-9.

Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of CPT-11 in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and in vivo and tumor growth in a leukemia xenograft model. Effects of CPT-11 on HL-60 cells were determined using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, comet assay, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. CPT-11 demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in HL-60 cells. CPT-11 promoted the release of AIF from mitochondria and its translocation to the nucleus. Bid, Bax, Apaf-1, caspase-9, AIF, Endo G, caspase-12, ATF-6b, Grp78, CDK2, Chk2, and cyclin D were all significantly upregulated and Bcl-2 was down-regulated by CPT-11 in HL-60 cells. Induction of cell-cycle arrest by CPT-11 was associated with changes in expression of key cell-cycle regulators such as CDK2, Chk2, and cyclin D in HL-60 cells. To test whether CPT-11 could augment antitumor activity in vivo, athymic BALB/c(nu/nu) nude mice were inoculated with HL-60 cells, followed by treatment with either CPT-11. The treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced tumor weight and volume in the HL-60 xenograft mice. The present study demonstrates the schedule-dependent antileukemia effect of CPT-11 using both in vitro and in vivo models.

The schistosome genome contains ~11,000 protein encoding genes for which the functions of few are well understood. Nonetheless, the newly described gene products and novel non-coding RNAs represent potential intervention targets, and molecular tools are being developed to determine their importance. Over the past decade, noteworthy advances has been reported towards development of tools for gene manipulation of schistosomes, including gene expression perturbation by RNAi, and transient and stable transfection including transgenesis mediated by genome integration competent vectors. Retrovirus-mediated transgenesis is an established functional genomic approach for model species. It offers the means to establish gain- or loss-of-function phenotypes, supports vector-based RNA interference, and represents a powerful forward genetics tool for insertional mutagenesis. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein mediates somatic transgenesis in S. mansoni, and vertical transmission of integrated transgenes in S. mansoni has been demonstrated, leading the establishment of transgenic lines. In addition, MLV transgenes encoding antibiotic resistance allow the selection of MLV-transduced parasites with the appropriate antibiotics. Here we describe detailed methods to produce and quantify pseudotyped MLV particles for use in transducing developmental stages of schistosomes. Approaches to analyze MLV-transduced schistosomes, including qPCR and high throughput approaches to verify and map genome integration of transgenes are also presented.

In patients transplanted for treatment of malignant hematologic disorders, monitoring of chimerism can provide an early indication of incipient disease relapse. The investigation of chimerism has therefore become an indispensable tool for the management of patients during the post-transplant period. Increasing use of reduced-intensity conditioning, which is associated with prolonged duration of mixed hematopoietic chimerism, has further increased the clinical importance of chimerism analysis. At present, the most commonly used technical approach to the investigation of chimerism is microsatellite analysis by polymerase chain reaction. The investigation of chimerism within specific leukocyte subsets isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples by flow sorting- or magnetic bead-based techniques provides more specific information on processes underlying the dynamics of donor/recipient chimerism. Moreover, cell subset-specific analysis permits the assessment of impending complications at a significantly higher sensitivity, thus providing a basis for earlier treatment decisions.","['Preuner, Sandra', 'Lion, Thomas']","['Preuner S', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Graft Rejection/diagnosis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-9437-9_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1109:271-91. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-9437-9_14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following HSCT, patients experience a period of reconstitution of the immune system, which seems to be highly dependent on conditioning, immunosuppression regimes, and the level of adverse events the patients experience. During this reconstitution period, the patient is immune compromised and susceptible to opportunistic infections and disease relapse. Consequently, a large number of clinical studies have been devoted to monitoring the recovery of the immune system following HSCT in the hopes of determining which cellular subsets are indicative of a favorable outcome. In this chapter we review the methods that have been employed to monitor the immune reconstitution and what clinical observations have been made. Of particular interest is the regulatory T cell (Treg) subset, which has been associated with tolerance and has been the subject of recent clinical trials as a possible cellular therapy for rejection reactions.

METHODS: A cohort study was performed of 159 children (aged 2 years-9.99 years) with SR-ALL who were enrolled on Children's Oncology Group protocol AALL0331 at 31 sites. Parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, the General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment Device, and the Coping Health Inventory for Parents at approximately 1, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis. RESULTS: Overall, mean scores for anxiety, depression, aggression, and hyperactivity were similar to population norms. However, more children scored in the at-risk/clinical range for depression than the expected 15% at 1 month (21.7%; P= .022), 6 months (28.6%; P< .001), and 12 months (21.1%; P= .032). For anxiety, more children scored in the at-risk/clinical range at 1 month (25.2% vs 15%; P= .001), but then reverted to expected levels. On adjusted analysis, unhealthy family functioning was found to be predictive of anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 2.24; P= .033) and depression (OR, 2.40; P= .008). Hispanic ethnicity was associated with anxiety (OR, 3.35; P= .009). Worse physical functioning (P= .049), unmarried parents (P= .017), and less reliance on social support (P= .004) were found to be associated with depression. Emotional distress at 1 month predicted anxiety (OR, 7.11; P= .002) and depression (OR, 3.31; P= .023) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is a significant problem in a subpopulation of patients with SR-ALL immediately after diagnosis, whereas depression remains a significant problem for at least 1 year. Children of Hispanic ethnicity or those with unhealthy family functioning may be particularly vulnerable. These data suggest that clinicians should screen for anxiety and depression throughout the first year of therapy.","['Myers, Regina M', 'Balsamo, Lyn', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Myers RM', 'Balsamo L', 'Lu X', 'Devidas M', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Winick NJ', 'Maloney KW', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine and Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140128,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Aggression/psychology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Anxiety/*etiology', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Depression/*etiology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychomotor Agitation/etiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",PMC4319360,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/06/21 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28578 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 May 1;120(9):1417-25. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28578.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of treatment with Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2/p53 interaction, on the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells and in myeloid cell lines with differential p53 status. METHOD: The expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 was quantitatively analyzed by real-time PCR in myeloid p53wild-type (OCI and MOLM) and p53null HL-60, leukemic cell lines, in patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia blasts, and in primary normal cell types, such as macrophages, endothelial cells, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The p53-dependence of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 upregulation that is induced by Nutlin-3 was analyzed in experiments performed using siRNA for p53, while the functional upregulation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 was analyzed by assessing the levels of phosphorylated STAT-3. RESULTS: Nutlin-3 significantly upregulated the transcription of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in p53wild-type OCI and MOLM but not in p53deleted p53null HL60, myeloid leukemic cell lines, as well as in primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts. Conversely, and somewhat unexpectedly, Nutlin-3 did not modulate the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 expression in primary normal macrophages, endothelial cells, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The p53-dependent upregulation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 by Nutlin-3 was associated with the downregulation of phosphorylated STAT-3, a major molecular target of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest a potential role for the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 as a therapeutic target of Nutlin-3 in p53 wild-type acute myeloid leukemias.","['Tisato, Veronica', 'Norcio, Alessia', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Milani, Daniela', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Secchiero, Paola']","['Tisato V', 'Norcio A', 'Celeghini C', 'Milani D', 'Gonelli A', 'Secchiero P']","['Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Department of Morphology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, University of Ferrara, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Ferrara, Italy.', 'IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Trieste, Italy, Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS \'\'Burlo Garofolo\'\', Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy, University of Trieste, Department of Life Sciences, Trieste, Italy.', 'Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Department of Morphology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, University of Ferrara, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Department of Morphology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, University of Ferrara, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Department of Morphology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, University of Ferrara, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",PMC3870313,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322014000100068 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2014(01)10 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2014 Jan;69(1):68-74. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2014(01)10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated frequencies of Th22, Th17, pure Th17, and Th1 cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of AML patients. We demonstrated that Th22, Th17, and pure Th17 in newly-diagnosed (ND) and non-complete remission (Non-CR) AML patients and plasma IL-22 in ND AML patients were significantly increased. Retinoid-related orphan receptor C (RORC) expression was significantly elevated in CR and Non-CR AML patients. However, Th1 in ND AML patients and IL-17 in ND, Non-CR or CR AML patients was significantly decreased compared with controls. Moreover, Th22 and IL-22 showed positive correlation with pure Th17, but Th22 showed negative correlation with Th1 in ND AML patients. RORC showed positive correlation with Th22 and approximately positive correlation with pure Th17 in Non-CR patients. PB blast cell showed positive correlation with Th22 and negative correlation with Th1 in ND AML patients. Our results indicate that Th22 and pure Th17 cells conjointly contribute to the pathogenesis of AML and might be promising novel clinical index for AML.","['Yu, Shuang', 'Liu, Chuanfang', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Shan, Baozhong', 'Tian, Tian', 'Hu, Yu', 'Shao, Linlin', 'Sun, Yuanxin', 'Ji, Chunyan', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Yu S', 'Liu C', 'Zhang L', 'Shan B', 'Tian T', 'Hu Y', 'Shao L', 'Sun Y', 'Ji C', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. yussdu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. liucfsy@gmail.com.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. zhanglsdu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Stomatology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China. sbzsdu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. tiantian0621010155@gmail.com.', 'Department of Oncology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. huysdu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. shaollsy@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. sunyxsdu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. jichunyan@sdu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. daoxinma@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140127,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (RORC protein, human)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukins/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3958830,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms15021927 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms15021927 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2014 Jan 27;15(2):1927-45. doi: 10.3390/ijms15021927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of imatinib resistance, the investigation of multidrug-resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and BCR-ABL yielded the following results: (i) Patients with high MDR1 transcript levels showed superior response at 48 months as compared with low-level MDR1 patients: major molecular response (MMR) in 41% vs 16% (P=0.014), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 58% vs 39% (P=0.044), and progression-free survival (PFS) in 67% vs 46% (P=0.032). (ii) Patients with BCR-ABL(IS) <28% achieved higher MMR rates (48% vs 21%, P=0.009). (iii) PFS at 48 months was associated with in vitro resistance of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations: 63% (no mutation) vs 61% (sensitive, intermediately sensitive or unknown IC50 (median inhibitory concentration)) vs 23% (resistant, P=0.01). (iv) Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions 1236 and 2677 were associated with higher MDR1 expression in comparison to wild type. (v) Nilotinib was able to impede proliferation of MDR1-overexpressing imatinib-resistant cells. High MDR1 gene expression might identify patients whose mode of imatinib resistance is essentially determined by increased efflux activity of MDR1 and therefore can be overcome by second-line nilotinib treatment.","['Agrawal, M', 'Hanfstein, B', 'Erben, P', 'Wolf, D', 'Ernst, T', 'Fabarius, A', 'Saussele, S', 'Purkayastha, D', 'Woodman, R C', 'Hofmann, W-K', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Muller, M C']","['Agrawal M', 'Hanfstein B', 'Erben P', 'Wolf D', 'Ernst T', 'Fabarius A', 'Saussele S', 'Purkayastha D', 'Woodman RC', 'Hofmann WK', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller MC']","['III.

Studies in adults suggest a role for specific environmental agents, but little is known about any effect from exposures in pregnancy to toxics in ambient air. In our case-control study, we ascertained 69 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 46 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from California Cancer Registry records of children <age 6, and 19,209 controls from California birth records within 2 km (1.3 miles) (ALL) and 6 km (3.8 miles) (AML) of an air toxics monitoring station between 1990 and 2007. Information on air toxics exposures was taken from community air monitors. We used logistic regression to estimate the risk of leukemia associated with one interquartile range increase in air toxic exposure. Risk of ALL was elevated with 3(rd) trimester exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.04, 1.29), arsenic (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.02, 1.73), benzene (OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.08, 2.09), and three other toxics related to fuel combustion. Risk of AML was increased with 3rd trimester exposure to chloroform (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.00, 1.69), benzene (1.75, 95% CI 1.04, 2.93), and two other traffic-related toxics. During the child's first year, exposure to butadiene, ortho-xylene, and toluene increased risk for AML and exposure to selenium increased risk for ALL. Benzene is an established cause of leukemia in adults; this study supports that ambient exposures to this and other chemicals in pregnancy and early life may also increase leukemia risk in children.","['Heck, Julia E', 'Park, Andrew S', 'Qiu, Jiaheng', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Ritz, Beate']","['Heck JE', 'Park AS', 'Qiu J', 'Cockburn M', 'Ritz B']","['Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

However, their impact on the central nervous system in allergic asthma remains unclear. We hypothesize that central neurogenic inflammation develops in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, and nerve growth factor (NGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are important mediators in its development. An asthma model of rats was established by sensitization and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). For further confirmation of the role of LIF in neurogenic inflammation, a subgroup was pretreated with intraperitoneally (i.p.) LIF antibody before OVA challenge. The levels of LIF and NGF were measured with reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry stain in lung tissue, airway-specific dorsal root ganglia (DRG, C7-T5) and brain stem of asthmatic rats, anti-LIF pretreated rats and controls. A significantly increased number of LIF- and NGF-immunoreactive cells were detected in lung tissue, DRG and the brain stem of asthmatic rats. In the asthma group a significantly increase level of mRNA encoding LIF and NGF in lung tissue was detected, but not in DRG and the brain stem. Pretreatment with LIF antibody decreased the level of LIF and NGF in all tissues. LIF is an important mediator in the crosstalk between nerve and immune systems. Our study demonstrate that the increased level of LIF and NGF in DRG and brain stem may be not based on result from de novo synthesis, but rather on result from retrograde nerve transport or passage across the blood-brain-barrier.","['Lin, Min-Juan', 'Lao, Xue-Jun', 'Liu, Sheng-Ming', 'Xu, Zhen-Hua', 'Zou, Wei-Feng']","['Lin MJ', 'Lao XJ', 'Liu SM', 'Xu ZH', 'Zou WF']","['Department of Pulmonology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.

We conducted a prospective comparison of QoL among older women receiving standard chemotherapy from the same cooperative group physicians in an RCT vs. an observational study (""off-trial""). METHODS: Older women with invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer (n=150 RCT; 530 off-trial) were included. Linear mixed-effects models tested associations between chemotherapy on- vs. off-trial and changes in EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) QoL scores over 24 months, controlling for pre-treatment QoL, age, education, tumor factors, comorbidity, and other covariates. RESULTS: Anthracycline regimens were used by 58% of women treated on-trial vs. 54% of those treated off-trial. Women in the RCT reported an adjusted mean increase of 13.7 points (95% CI 10.2, 17.1) in global QoL at 24 months (vs. mid-treatment), while women treated off-trial had only an adjusted improvement of 7.0 points (95% CI 3.5, 10.4; p=.007 for difference in mean changes). Women in the RCT had significantly greater improvement in emotional function than those treated off-trial, controlling for baseline; they also had greater reductions in therapy side effects and fatigue at 24 months than women off-trial, controlling for covariates. CONCLUSION: There may be different QoL trajectories for older women undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy on- vs. off-trial. If confirmed, the results suggest that the extra monitoring and communication within an RCT could provide the infrastructure for interventions to address symptoms and improve QoL for the growing older cancer population.","['Mandelblatt, Jeanne S', 'Makgoeng, Solomon B', 'Luta, Gheorghe', 'Hurria, Arti', 'Kimmick, Gretchen', 'Isaacs, Claudine', 'Tallarico, Michelle', 'Barry, William T', 'Pitcher, Brandy', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Muss, Hyman B']","['Mandelblatt JS', 'Makgoeng SB', 'Luta G', 'Hurria A', 'Kimmick G', 'Isaacs C', 'Tallarico M', 'Barry WT', 'Pitcher B', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis C', 'Cohen HJ', 'Muss HB']","['Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center and Lombardi Cancer Center, Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Washington, DC, USA.

Therefore, novel TKIs effective against T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha are needed. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel orally bioavailable TKI against T315I Bcr-Abl, but it is not clear whether ponatinib is effective against T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ponatinib on T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis in silico was performed. The effects of ponatinib on PDGFRalpha signaling pathways, apoptosis and cell cycling were examined in EOL-1, BaF3 cells expressing either wild type (WT) or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. The in vivo antitumor activity of ponatinib was evaluated with xenografted BaF3-T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha cells in nude mice models. RESULTS: Molecular docking analysis revealed that ponatinib could bind to the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly)-out state of T674I PDGFRalpha. Ponatinib potently inhibited the phosphorylation of WT and T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and their downstream signaling molecules (e.g., Stat3, Stat5). Ponatinib strikingly inhibited the growth of both WT and T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-carrying CEL cells (IC50: 0.004-2.5 nM). It induced apoptosis in CEL cells with caspase-3-dependent cleavage of Mcl-1, and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin to decrease its stability and pro-survival functions. In vivo, ponatinib abrogated the growth of xenografted BaF3-T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha cells in nude mice.

We determined menin-inhibitor co-crystal structures and found that these compounds closely mimic all key interactions of MLL with menin. Extensive crystallography studies combined with structure-based design were applied for optimization of these compounds, resulting in MIV-6R, which inhibits the menin-MLL interaction with IC50 = 56 nM.

To explore the antitumor effect of anthocyanin, a roselle bioactive polyphenol in a rat model of chemical-induced leukemia was assayed. Anthocyanin extract of roselle (Hibiscus anthocyanins, HAs) was supplemented in the diet (0.1 and 0.2%). This study was carried out to evaluate the protective effect of HAs on N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU)-induced leukemia of rats. The study employed male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48), and leukemia was induced by intravenous injection of 35 mg kg(-1) body weight of NMU dissolved in physiologic saline solution. The rats were divided into four groups (n = 12): control, NMU only, and HAs groups that received different doses of HAs (0.1 and 0.2%) daily, orally, after NMU injection. After 220 days, the animals were killed, and the following parameters were assessed: morphological observation, hematology examination, histopathological assessment, and biochemical assay. When compared with the NMU-only group, HAs significantly prevented loss of organ weight and ameliorated the impairment of morphology, hematology, and histopathology. Treatment with HAs caused reduction in the levels of AST, ALT, uric acid, and MPO. Also, the results showed that oral administration of HAs (0.2%) remarkably inhibited progression of NMU-induced leukemia by approximately 33.3% in rats. This is the first report to demonstrate that the sequential administration of HAs followed by NMU resulted in an antileukemic activity in vivo.","['Tsai, Tsung-Chang', 'Huang, Hui-Pei', 'Chang, Yun-Ching', 'Wang, Chau-Jong']","['Tsai TC', 'Huang HP', 'Chang YC', 'Wang CJ']","['Superintendent Office, Antai Medical Care Cooperation, Antai Tian-Sheng Memorial Hospital , Pingtung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140206,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthocyanins/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Hibiscus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Methylnitrosourea/adverse effects', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,2014/01/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf405235j [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2014 Feb 19;62(7):1572-80. doi: 10.1021/jf405235j.

However the mechanism(s) of reprogramming still need detailed elucidation, including the roles played by the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling pathway. LIF is central in maintaining the ground state pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs by activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK-STAT3) pathway. Characterizing and understanding this pathway holds the key to generate naive pluripotent human iPSCs which will facilitate the development of patient-specific stem cell therapy.

Regional variation in the prevalence of HTLV-I was observed; 0%, 0%, 0.1%, 1.9%, 0.3%, 0%, and 2.6% tested HTLV-I-positive from west to east of Golestan Province regions, respectively. Seropositivity increased with age. No association between HTLV-I infection and sex status was detected. CONCLUSION: Highest rate of HTLV-I seroprevalence was shown in east of this region located in neighborhood with Khorasan province, the only confirmed endemic area in Iran. It seems that eastern area of our province is endemic for HTLV-I. Further comprehensive detailed epidemiological and molecular studies are recommended.","['Kalavi, Khodaberdi', 'Moradi, Abdolvahab', 'Tabarraei, Alijan']","['Kalavi K', 'Moradi A', 'Tabarraei A']","['Infectious Diseases Research Centre, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Centre, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Centre, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC3881256,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/01/29 06:01,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/29 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2013 Mar;16(3):225-8.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ELISA', 'Golestan', 'HTLV-I', 'Iran', 'Seroprevalence', 'Western Blot']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I has been detected in heart autopsies, particularly in lymphoma\leukemia cases. Mashhad and Neyshabour (Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran) are endemic regions for HTLV-I. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the impact of HTLV-I on CAD in Neyshabourian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 7590 patients admitted to Razavi and Imam Reza Hospitals (2007-2008) were included in this study. The seroprevalance of HTLV-I infection was determined by the ELISA method and confirmed with the PCR method. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software. RESULTS: Out of the 7590 studied subjects, 564 patients were born and had resided in Neyshabour. The HTLV-I sero-prevalence among these subjects was 13% (n=73). 294 subjects had an abnormal angiography (CAD) and among them 43 (14.6%) were sero-positive for HTLV-I. In the remaining 227 subjects who had a normal angiography, 30 cases were HTLV-I seropositve. The PCR test was performed on 35 cases in order to confirm the presence of infection, which was positive in 31. Regarding the initial population of 294, the rate of PCR-confirmed infection was 10.54%. Conclusion : This sero-prevalence of HTLV-I in subjects with heart complications in Neyshabour was nearly 3 times more than the general population of this city (10.5 % vs 3.4%). However, the results of this study show that in addition to HTLV-I infection, there might be other co-factors leading to the development of heart complications in Neyshabour.","['Farid Hosseni, Reza', 'Jabbari, Farahzad', 'Shabestari, Mahmoud', 'Rezaee, S A Rahim', 'Gharivani, Yousef', 'Valizadeh, Narges', 'Sobhani, Mansoreh', 'Moghiman, Toktam', 'Mozayani, Farnaz']","['Farid Hosseni R', 'Jabbari F', 'Shabestari M', 'Rezaee SA', 'Gharivani Y', 'Valizadeh N', 'Sobhani M', 'Moghiman T', 'Mozayani F']","['Allergy Research Centre.', 'Immunology Research Centre.', 'Preventive Cardiovascular Care Research Centre.', 'Inflammation Research Centre.', 'Preventive Cardiovascular Care Research Centre.', 'Immunology Research Centre.', 'Allergy Research Centre.', 'Preventive Cardiovascular Care Research Centre.', 'Inflammation Research Centre.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC3881252,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/01/29 06:01,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/29 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2013 Mar;16(3):217-20.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)', 'HTLV-I', 'Risk factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Khorasan province in Iran is an endemic area. The majority of HTLV-I-infected individuals sustain healthy carriers but small proportion of infected population developed two progressive diseases: HAM/TSP and ATL. The proviral load could be a virological marker for disease monitoring, therefore in the present study HTLV-I proviral load has been evaluated in ATL and compared to HAM/TSP and healthy carriers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case series study, 47 HTLV-I infected individuals including 13 ATL, 23 HAM/TSP and 11 asymptomatic subjects were studied. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were investigated for presence of HTLV-I DNA provirus by PCR using LTR and Tax fragments. Then in infected subjects, HTLV-I proviral load was measured using real time PCR TaqMan method. RESULTS: The average age of patients in ATL was 52+/-8, in HAM/TSP 45.52+/-15.17 and in carrier's 38.65+/-14.9 years which differences were not statistically significant. The analysis of data showed a significant difference in mean WBC among study groups (ATL vs HAM/TSP and carriers P=0.0001). Moreover, mean HTLV-I proviral load was 11967.2 +/- 5078, 409 +/- 71.3 and 373.6 +/- 143.3 in ATL, HAM/TSP and Healthy Carriers, respectively. The highest HTLV-I proviral load was measured in ATL group that had a significant correlation with WBC count (R=0.495, P=0.001). The proviral load variations between study groups was strongly significant (ATL vs carrier P=0.0001; ATL vs HAM/TSP P= 0.0001 and HAM/TSP vs carriers P< 0.05). Conclusion : The present study demonstrated that HTLV-I proviral load was higher in ATL group in comparison with HAM/TSP and healthy carriers. Therefore, HTLV-I proviral load is a prognostic factor for development of HTLV-I associated diseases and can be used as a monitoring marker for the efficiency of therapeutic regime.","['Akbarin, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Hassannia, Tahereh', 'Shoja Razavi, Ghazaleh', 'Sabet, Faezeh', 'Shirdel, Abbas']","['Akbarin MM', 'Rahimi H', 'Hassannia T', 'Shoja Razavi G', 'Sabet F', 'Shirdel A']","['Inflammation and inflammatory research centre, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad- Iran.', 'Inflammation and inflammatory research centre, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad- Iran ; Internal medicine Dept.

The malignancy, first described by Uchiyama and co-workers in southwestern Japan, was named Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL) and characterized with cutaneous and respiratory involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and various metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalcemia. The HTLV-I has been known to be endemic to certain parts of Iran like the province of Khorasan in the northeast since 1990, with a 2.3% prevalence rate of infection. The main manifestations of HTLV-I infection are neurologic and hematologic (such as ATL) disorders, but it has also other manifestations such as uveitis, arthritis, dermatitis, vitiligo and lymphocytic alveolitis. Its main neurologic manifestation is a chronic progressive myelopathy that is referred to HTLV-I Associated Myelopathy (HAM) in Japan and Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) in Caribbean. But other disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, polyradiculoneuropathy, myopathy, peripheral facial paresis, and so on have been reported too.

Therefore, viral infection is usually not the only cause of cancer, and further environmental and host factors, may be implicated. HTLV-I, in particular, is considered as an oncovirus cause of lymphoproliferative disease such as adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and disturbs the immune responses which results in HTLV-I associated meylopathy/tropical spastic parapresis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-I infection causes ATL in a small proportion of infected subjects (2-5%) following a prolonged incubation period (15-30 years) despite a strong adaptive immune response against the virus.

Innovative targets for therapy are needed to improve survival and reduce long-term sequelae. The aim of this study was to find a candidate tumor-promoting protein, abundantly expressed in tumor cells but not in normal brain tissues, as a potential target for therapy. METHODS: In silico proteomics and genomics, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy validation were performed. RNA interference was used to ascertain the functional role of the overexpressed candidate target protein. RESULTS: In silico proteomics and genomics revealed pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) interacting protein 1 (PBXIP1) overexpression in adult and childhood high-grade glioma and ependymoma compared with normal brain. PBXIP1 is a PBX-family interacting microtubule-binding protein with a putative role in migration and proliferation of cancer cells. Immunohistochemical studies in glial tumors validated PBXIP1 expression in astrocytoma and ependymoma but not in oligodendroglioma. RNAi-mediated PBXIP1-knockdown in glioblastoma cell lines strongly reduced proliferation and migration and induced morphological changes, indicating that PBXIP1 knockdown decreases glioma cell viability and motility through rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, expression of PBXIP1 was observed in radial glia and astrocytic progenitor cells in human fetal tissues, suggesting that PBXIP1 is an astroglial progenitor cell marker during human embryonic development. CONCLUSION: PBXIP1 is a novel protein overexpressed in astrocytoma and ependymoma, involved in tumor cell proliferation and migration, that warrants further exploration as a novel therapeutic target in these tumors.","['van Vuurden, Dannis G', 'Aronica, Eleonora', 'Hulleman, Esther', 'Wedekind, Laurine E', 'Biesmans, Dennis', 'Malekzadeh, Arjan', 'Bugiani, Marianna', 'Geerts, Dirk', 'Noske, David P', 'Vandertop, W Peter', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Wurdinger, Thomas', 'van der Stoop, Petra P M']","['van Vuurden DG', 'Aronica E', 'Hulleman E', 'Wedekind LE', 'Biesmans D', 'Malekzadeh A', 'Bugiani M', 'Geerts D', 'Noske DP', 'Vandertop WP', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J', 'Wurdinger T', 'van der Stoop PP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,"['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (PBXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Astrocytoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC4057136,2014/01/29 06:00,2015/09/30 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['not308 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/not308 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2014 Jul;16(7):946-59. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/not308.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the factors governing the development of these unique iNKT sublineages during thymic development are unknown. In this study we explored the mechanism by which E protein transcription factors and their negative regulators, the Id proteins, control the development of iNKT sublineages after positive selection. We found that E proteins directly bound the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) promoter and were required for expression of this lineage-defining transcription factor and for the maturation and expansion of thymic iNKT cells. Moreover, expression of the negative regulators of E proteins, Id2 and Id3, defined distinct iNKT cell sublineages. Id3 was expressed in PLZF(high) NKT2 cells and loss of Id3 allowed for increased thymic iNKT cell expansion and abundance of the PLZF(+) NKT2 sublineage. Id2 was expressed in T-BET(+) NKT1 cells, and both Id proteins were required for the formation of this sublineage. Thus, we provide insight into E and Id protein regulation of iNKT cell proliferation and differentiation to specific sublineages during development in the thymus.","[""D'Cruz, Louise M"", 'Stradner, Martin H', 'Yang, Cliff Y', 'Goldrath, Ananda W']","[""D'Cruz LM"", 'Stradner MH', 'Yang CY', 'Goldrath AW']","['Division of Biology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140127,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Idb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '135845-89-5 (Idb3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC3943952,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/04/20 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302904 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302904 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Mar 1;192(5):2227-36. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302904.

Major advances have been recently made to understand the molecular pathogenesis underlying CLL, but defects in apoptosis are considered to be the most important factors. Although neoplastic cells are resistant to apoptosis in vivo, they show decreased level of spontaneous in vitro apoptosis, with significant differences among CLL patients. This work compares the level of spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis with prognostic factors and clinical course of the disease. In vitro spontaneous apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was analyzed using Annexin-V assay (confirmed by TUNEL method) in 135 treatment naive patients with CLL. Levels of apoptosis after 48h culture in patients with stable disease were found to be significantly higher than in the group with progressive course of the disease (p=0.015). Moreover, the level of spontaneous apoptosis after 24h and 48h of incubation correlated inversely with the progression free survival (p=0.026 and 0.009, respectively). These results suggest that in vitro spontaneous apoptosis of CLL cells may be a simple and cheap prognostic test which is relatively quick to use, and can predict the course of the disease and response to treatment.

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) represents a potentially curative treatment for B-PLL, the number of B-PLL patients who have been treated with allo-HSCT is small and its efficacy has not been established. We report the case of a 59-year-old woman with B-PLL in partial remission, who was successfully treated with allo-HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). She was initially treated with four courses of combination chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone, which resulted in partial remission with residual tumor cells comprising 7 % of bone marrow nucleated cells. Although the residual B-PLL cells appeared to be indolent, as the disease progressed slowly during partial remission, these cells lost CD20 expression, and the prognosis of the patient was considered to be poor with conventional chemotherapy. She was therefore given RIC, followed by allo-HSCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor. Her clinical course following allo-HSCT was uneventful, and she remained in complete remission at 32 months post-transplantation. Although the therapeutic strategy for B-PLL should be determined based on the severity of the disease, RIC with allo-HSCT may be a therapeutic option for indolent B-PLL when the long-term prognosis of patients is markedly poor.","['Arima, Hiroshi', 'Ono, Yuichiro', 'Tabata, Sumie', 'Matsushita, Akiko', 'Hashimoto, Hisako', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki', 'Takahashi, Takayuki']","['Arima H', 'Ono Y', 'Tabata S', 'Matsushita A', 'Hashimoto H', 'Ishikawa T', 'Takahashi T']","['Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140128,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2013/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1505-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Apr;99(4):519-22. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1505-2.

The complex mediates long-range interaction between the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) and active globin genes, and although TAL1 is one of the two DNA-binding complex members, its role is unclear. To explore the role of TAL1 in transcription activation of the human gamma-globin genes, we reduced the expression of TAL1 in erythroid K562 cells using lentiviral short hairpin RNA, compromising its association in the beta-globin locus. In the TAL1 knockdown cells, the gamma-globin transcription was reduced to 35% and chromatin looping of the (G)gamma-globin gene with the LCR was disrupted with decreased occupancy of the complex member Ldb1 and LMO2 in the locus. However, GATA-1 binding, DNase I hypersensitive site formation and several histone modifications were largely maintained across the beta-globin locus. In addition, overexpression of TAL1 increased the gamma-globin transcription and increased interaction frequency between the (G)gamma-globin gene and LCR. These results indicate that TAL1 plays a critical role in chromatin loop formation between the gamma-globin genes and LCR, which is a critical step for the transcription of the gamma-globin genes.","['Yun, Won Ju', 'Kim, Yea Woon', 'Kang, Yujin', 'Lee, Jungbae', 'Dean, Ann', 'Kim, AeRi']","['Yun WJ', 'Kim YW', 'Kang Y', 'Lee J', 'Dean A', 'Kim A']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Pusan 609-735, Korea and Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140126,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (gamma-Globins)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'LIM Domain Proteins/metabolism', '*Locus Control Region', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'beta-Globins/*genetics', 'gamma-Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",PMC3985645,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/07/09 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['gku072 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku072 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Apr;42(7):4283-93. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku072.

Pharmacological manipulation of B-cell-specific IL-10 synthesis could, thus, be therapeutically useful in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, transplantation, autoimmunity and sepsis. TLR are thought to play a protagonistic role in the formation of IL-10-secreting B cells. The aim of the study was to identify the molecular events selectively driving IL-10 production in TLR9-stimulated human B cells. Our data highlight the selectivity of calcineurin inhibitors in blocking TLR9-induced B-cell-derived IL-10 transcription and secretion, while IL-6 transcription and release, B-cell proliferation, and differentiation remain unaffected. Nevertheless, TLR9-induced IL-10 production was found to be independent of calcineurin phosphatase activity and was even negatively regulated by NFAT. In contrast to TLR9-induced IL-6, IL-10 secretion was highly sensitive to targeting of spleen tyrosine kinase (syk) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Further analyses demonstrated increased phosphorylation of Ca(2+) /calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) in TLR9-stimulated B cells and selective reduction of TLR9-induced secretion of IL-10 upon treatment with CaMKII inhibitors, with negligible impact on IL-6 levels. Altogether, our results identify calcineurin antagonists as selective inhibitors of IL-10 transcription and syk/Bruton s tyrosine kinase-induced Ca(2+) /calmodulin- and CaMKII-dependent signaling as a pathway regulating the release of TLR9-induced B-cell-derived IL-10.","['Ziegler, Saskia', 'Gartner, Katrin', 'Scheuermann, Uwe', 'Zoeller, Tanja', 'Hantzschmann, Julia', 'Over, Benjamin', 'Foermer, Sandra', 'Heeg, Klaus', 'Bekeredjian-Ding, Isabelle']","['Ziegler S', 'Gartner K', 'Scheuermann U', 'Zoeller T', 'Hantzschmann J', 'Over B', 'Foermer S', 'Heeg K', 'Bekeredjian-Ding I']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140219,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology', 'Calcineurin/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2013/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201343994 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2014 May;44(5):1285-98. doi: 10.1002/eji.201343994.

Can this toxic metalloid sustain life?,475-98,10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_15 [doi],"It was recently reported that a bacterium, Halomonas species GFAJ-1, isolated from arsenic-rich Mono Lake and further selected for growth under conditions of high arsenate and low phosphate, is able to grow using arsenic instead of phosphorus. This claim, and subsequent studies to evaluate GFAJ-1, has brought new attention to the question of whether arsenic can play an essential or sustaining role for living organisms. If true, this would be in stark contrast to the well known toxicity of this element and its ability to cause a number of diseases, including cancer of the skin, lung, bladder, liver, and kidney. However, while deadly at high doses, arsenic oxide is also an approved and effective chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This review examines the evidence that arsenic may be a beneficial nutrient at trace levels below the background to which living organisms are normally exposed. It also examines whether arsenic can be used to sustain organisms growing under high arsenic conditions, specifically the results from recent studies of arsenic biochemistry motivated by the report of GFAJ-1. Both of these topics are considered in the context of the toxicity of this element and its ability to cause cancer and other diseases, yet its Janus-faced ability to effectively treat APL.","['Wilcox, Dean E']",['Wilcox DE'],"['Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, USA, dwilcox@dartmouth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Met Ions Life Sci,Metal ions in life sciences,101513478,['N712M78A8G (Arsenic)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Arsenic/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Met Ions Life Sci. 2013;13:475-98. doi: 10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_15.,,,,['P42 ES07373/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and altered expression in drug transporter genes may influence IM response. In order to investigate whether mRNA expression and SNPs in drug transporters are associated with IM resistance, we studied 118 chronic-phase CML patients receiving the standard dose of IM (400 mg/day). They were assigned as responders and non-responders according to European LeukemiaNet criteria (2009). mRNA expression in samples at diagnosis (without IM therapy) and outcomes after IM failure were also evaluated in subgroups of patients. Major molecular response (MMR), complete molecular response and primary and secondary resistance were all assessed. BCR-ABL1, ABCB1, ABCG2, SLC22A1 and SLCO1A2 mRNA expression and SNPs in ABCG2 and SLC22A1 genes were analyzed. ABCG2 mRNA expression in the non-responders was higher before and during IM therapy. Furthermore, ABCG2 was overexpressed in those who did not achieve MMR (P=0.027). In a subgroup of patients who switched to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, high mRNA expression of ABCG2 was associated with a risk of 24 times that of not achieving complete cytogenetic response (OR 24.00, 95% CI 1.74-330.80; P=0.018). In the responder group, patients who achieved MMR (P=0.009) presented higher mRNA levels of SLC22A1. The SNPs were not associated with mRNA expression of ABCG2 and SLC22A1. Our data suggest that elevated ABCG2 expression (an efflux transporter) could be associated with IM resistance and could impact on second-generation TKI response, whereas high SLC22A1 expression (an influx transporter) may be associated with a successful IM therapy in CML patients.","['de Lima, Luciene Terezina', 'Vivona, Douglas', 'Bueno, Carolina Tosin', 'Hirata, Rosario D C', 'Hirata, Mario H', 'Luchessi, Andre D', 'de Castro, Fabiola Attie', 'de Lourdes F Chauffaille, Maria', 'Zanichelli, Maria A', 'Chiattone, Carlos S', 'Hungria, Vania T M', 'Guerra-Shinohara, Elvira M']","['de Lima LT', 'Vivona D', 'Bueno CT', 'Hirata RD', 'Hirata MH', 'Luchessi AD', 'de Castro FA', 'de Lourdes F Chauffaille M', 'Zanichelli MA', 'Chiattone CS', 'Hungria VT', 'Guerra-Shinohara EM']","['Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

The molecular mechanism of therapeutic resistance remains poorly understood. The TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-FGF-inducible 14 (TNFRSF12A/Fn14) signaling axis is known to promote cancer cell survival via NF-kappaB activation and the upregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members. Here, a role was determined for TWEAK-Fn14 prosurvival signaling in NSCLC through the upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1/Mcl-1). Mcl-1 expression significantly correlated with Fn14 expression, advanced NSCLC tumor stage, and poor patient prognosis in human primary NSCLC tumors. TWEAK stimulation of NSCLC cells induced NF-kappaB-dependent Mcl-1 protein expression and conferred Mcl-1-dependent chemo- and radioresistance. Depletion of Mcl-1 via siRNA or pharmacologic inhibition of Mcl-1, using EU-5148, sensitized TWEAK-treated NSCLC cells to cisplatin- or radiation-mediated inhibition of cell survival. Moreover, EU-5148 inhibited cell survival across a panel of NSCLC cell lines. In contrast, inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL function had minimal effect on suppressing TWEAK-induced cell survival. Collectively, these results position TWEAK-Fn14 signaling through Mcl-1 as a significant mechanism for NSCLC tumor cell survival and open new therapeutic avenues to abrogate the high mortality rate seen in NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS: The TWEAK-Fn14 signaling axis enhances lung cancer cell survival and therapeutic resistance through Mcl-1, positioning both TWEAK-Fn14 and Mcl-1 as therapeutic opportunities in lung cancer.","['Whitsett, Timothy G', 'Mathews, Ian T', 'Cardone, Michael H', 'Lena, Ryan J', 'Pierceall, William E', 'Bittner, Michael', 'Sima, Chao', 'LoBello, Janine', 'Weiss, Glen J', 'Tran, Nhan L']","['Whitsett TG', 'Mathews IT', 'Cardone MH', 'Lena RJ', 'Pierceall WE', 'Bittner M', 'Sima C', 'LoBello J', 'Weiss GJ', 'Tran NL']","['Translational Genomics Research Institute, 445 N.

Glycosylation of the rat and hamster CAT1s inhibits Eco-MLV infection, and treatment of rat and hamster cells with a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, enhances Eco-MLV infection. Although the mouse CAT1 is also glycosylated, it does not inhibit Eco-MLV infection. Comparison of amino acid sequences between the rat and mouse CAT1s shows amino acid insertions in the rat protein near the Eco-MLV-binding motif. In addition to the insertion present in the rat CAT1, the hamster CAT1 has additional amino acid insertions. In contrast, tunicamycin treatment of mink and human cells does not elevate the infection, because their CAT1s do not have the Eco-MLV-binding motif. To define the evolutionary pathway of the Eco-MLV receptor, we analyzed CAT1 sequences and susceptibility to Eco-MLV infection of other several murinae animals, including the southern vole (Microtus rossiaemeridionalis), large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus), and Eurasian harvest mouse (Micromys minutus). Eco-MLV infection was enhanced by tunicamycin in these cells, and their CAT1 sequences have the insertions like the hamster CAT1. Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian CAT1s suggested that the ancestral CAT1 does not have the Eco-MLV-binding motif, like the human CAT1, and the mouse CAT1 is thought to be generated by the amino acid deletions in the third extracellular loop of CAT1.","['Kakoki, Katsura', 'Shinohara, Akio', 'Izumida, Mai', 'Koizumi, Yosuke', 'Honda, Eri', 'Kato, Goro', 'Igawa, Tsukasa', 'Sakai, Hideki', 'Hayashi, Hideki', 'Matsuyama, Toshifumi', 'Morita, Tetsuo', 'Koshimoto, Chihiro', 'Kubo, Yoshinao']","['Kakoki K', 'Shinohara A', 'Izumida M', 'Koizumi Y', 'Honda E', 'Kato G', 'Igawa T', 'Sakai H', 'Hayashi H', 'Matsuyama T', 'Morita T', 'Koshimoto C', 'Kubo Y']","['Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140128,United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arvicolinae', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gerbillinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae/classification/*genetics/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Rodent Diseases/*virology']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2013/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11262-014-1036-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2014 Jun;48(3):448-56. doi: 10.1007/s11262-014-1036-1.

In this research, we examined the roles of Stil in cell proliferation after degeneration in adult zebrafish retinas. We demonstrated that knockdown of Stil gene expression or inhibition of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling transduction decreases the rate of cell proliferation. In contrast, activation of Shh signal transduction promotes cell proliferation. In nbb(+/-) retinas, inhibition of SUFU (a repressor in the Shh pathway) rescues the defects in cell proliferation due to down-regulation of Stil gene expression. The latter data suggest that Stil play a role in cell proliferation through the Shh signal transduction pathway.","['Sun, Lei', 'Li, Ping', 'Carr, Aprell L', 'Gorsuch, Ryne', 'Yarka, Clare', 'Li, Jingling', 'Bartlett, Michael', 'Pfister, Delaney', 'Hyde, David R', 'Li, Lei']","['Sun L', 'Li P', 'Carr AL', 'Gorsuch R', 'Yarka C', 'Li J', 'Bartlett M', 'Pfister D', 'Hyde DR', 'Li L']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556; Department of Physiology, Nankai University, Tianjin, China 370001.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556; Center for Zebrafish Research, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556; Center for Zebrafish Research, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556; Center for Zebrafish Research, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556; Center for Zebrafish Research, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556; Center for Zebrafish Research, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.

We recently identified c-Cbl (henceforth referred to as Cbl) as a GM-CSF receptor (GMR) responsive protein that targets Src for ubiquitin-mediated destruction upon GM-CSF stimulation and showed that a loss of negative regulation of Src is pivotal in the hyperactivation of GMR signalling in JMML cells. However, the mechanism regulating the chemoresistant nature of JMML has remained largely unknown. Here, we show that the JMML-associated Cbl mutant in complex with the Src family kinase Lyn promotes Cbl's adapter function, leading to increased association to PI3K regulatory subunit p85 and Lyn-dependent AKT pro-survival signalling. Notably, molecular or pharmacologic inhibition of the Lyn-PI3K/AKT pathway, but not the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling axis, markedly increased the sensitivity of the otherwise chemoresistant Cbl mutant-JMML cells to chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the treatment of JMML patients. These results support the potential translational benefit of combining modalities that inhibit Lyn-PI3K/AKT signalling with traditional antileukaemia agents in the management of JMML.","['Bunda, S', 'Qin, K', 'Kommaraju, K', 'Heir, P', 'Ohh, M']","['Bunda S', 'Qin K', 'Kommaraju K', 'Heir P', 'Ohh M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140127,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2013/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013596 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.596 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Feb 5;34(6):789-97. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.596.

SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the RAS MAPK pathway and can interact with neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product. Individuals with NF1 have a higher risk of haematological malignancies. SPRED1 is highly expressed in haematopoietic cells and negatively regulates haematopoiesis. SPRED1 seemed to be a good candidate for leukaemia predisposition or transformation. We performed SPRED1 mutation screening and expression status in 230 paediatric lymphoblastic and acute myeloblastic leukaemias (AMLs). We found a loss-of-function frameshift SPRED1 mutation in a patient with Legius syndrome. In this patient, the leukaemia blasts karyotype showed a SPRED1 loss of heterozygosity, confirming SPRED1 as a tumour suppressor. Our observation confirmed that acute leukaemias are rare complications of the Legius syndrome. Moreover, SPRED1 was significantly decreased at RNA and protein levels in the majority of AMLs at diagnosis compared with normal or paired complete remission bone marrows. SPRED1 decreased expression correlated with genetic features of AML. Our study reveals a new mechanism which contributes to deregulate RAS MAPK pathway in the vast majority of paediatric AMLs.","['Pasmant, E', 'Gilbert-Dussardier, B', 'Petit, A', 'de Laval, B',

Despite several promising leads in preclinical models, no agent has yet been approved for clinical use. Here we will review the development of novel therapies for AML with FLT3 mutations. RECENT FINDINGS: Initial clinical development focused on broad kinase inhibitors which were found to have limited clinical activity due to insufficient kinase inhibitory activity and high toxicity. Subsequent development has brought forth narrow-spectrum inhibitors with potent in-vivo activity and reasonable clinical tolerance, but many patients still progress with prolonged use. SUMMARY: The optimal role for targeting FLT3 may depend on multimodality therapy and will likely require hematopoietic transplant. The incorporation of ABL kinase inhibitors into acute lymphoblastic leukemia management should serve as a model for incorporation of FLT3-targeted agents into clinical care. Strategies incorporating FLT3-targeted agents into AML therapy are ongoing, but challenges in trial design, clinical heterogeneity and need for long-term follow-up make these investigations complicated in design and implementation.","['Pratz, Keith W', 'Luger, Selina M']","['Pratz KW', 'Luger SM']","['aDepartment of Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland bAbramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4142569,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000022 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):72-8. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000022.,,,,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS596063'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to purify, characterize and assess allergenicity of one of its clinically relevant allergens, later identified as phaseolin. This study was carried out using clinical, in vivo and ex vivo approaches. Phaseolin, an abundant protein of red kidney bean, was purified by column chromatography and reverse-phase-HPLC techniques and characterized by peptide mass fingerprinting. The IgE immunoblotting using red kidney bean allergic patients sera showed phaseolin as a major IgE binding protein of red kidney bean. Phaseolin treated mice demonstrated enhanced levels of specific IgE and IgG1, mouse mast cell protease-1, mRNA expressions of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and GATA-3 in the lungs, spleen and intestine along with anaphylactic symptoms indicative of allergic responses. Further, flow cytometry analysis and immunohistochemical studies indicated increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and GATA-3, respectively as compared to controls. The level of Foxp3 was found suppressed in the intestine of phaseolin treated mice when compared to the control. Further, phaseolin treated mice showed positive results in type 1 skin test. Bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells showed enhanced release of allergic mediators like beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2. Taken together, phaseolin was found to possess characteristics of a potential allergen that may lead to hypersensitivity responses in the susceptible individuals and this may be one of the major proteins responsible for allergenicity of red kidney bean.","['Kumar, Sandeep', 'Verma, Alok Kumar', 'Sharma, Akanksha', 'Roy, Ruchi', 'Kumar, Dinesh', 'Bh, Giridhar', 'Tripathi, Anurag', 'Chaudhari, Bhushan P', 'Das, Mukul', 'Jain, S K', 'Dwivedi, Premendra D']","['Kumar S', 'Verma AK', 'Sharma A', 'Roy R', 'Kumar D', 'Bh G', 'Tripathi A', 'Chaudhari BP', 'Das M', 'Jain SK', 'Dwivedi PD']","['Food, Drug and Chemical Toxicology Group, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR), M.G.

We have improved previous ex vivo drug testing with 4 innovations: identifying individual leukemic cells, using intact whole blood during the incubation, using an automated platform that escalates reliably data, and performing analyses pharmacodynamic population models. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were sent from 24 hospitals to a central laboratory and incubated for 48 hours in whole blood, after which drug activity was measured in terms of depletion of leukemic cells. RESULTS: The sensitivity of single drugs is assessed for standard efficacy (EMAX) and potency (EC50) variables, ranked as percentiles within the population.

NMF reduces the dimensionality of non-negative data by decomposing it into two smaller non-negative factors with physical interpretation for class discovery. The NMF algorithm, however, assumes a deterministic framework. In particular, the effect of the data noise on the stability of the factorization and the convergence of the algorithm are unknown. Collected data, on the other hand, is stochastic in nature due to measurement noise and sometimes inherent variability in the physical process. This paper presents new theoretical and applied developments to the problem of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). First, we generalize the deterministic NMF algorithm to include a general class of update rules that converges towards an optimal non-negative factorization. Second, we extend the NMF framework to the probabilistic case (PNMF). We show that the Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the non-negative factors is the solution to a weighted regularized non-negative matrix factorization problem. We subsequently derive update rules that converge towards an optimal solution. Third, we apply the PNMF to cluster and classify DNA microarrays data. The proposed PNMF is shown to outperform the deterministic NMF and the sparse NMF algorithms in clustering stability and classification accuracy.","['Bayar, Belhassen', 'Bouaynaya, Nidhal', 'Shterenberg, Roman']","['Bayar B', 'Bouaynaya N', 'Shterenberg R']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Road, Glassboro, NJ 08028, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140109,Singapore,J Bioinform Comput Biol,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,101187344,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics', 'Microarray Analysis/*methods', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1142/S0219720014500012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bioinform Comput Biol. 2014 Feb;12(1):1450001. doi: 10.1142/S0219720014500012.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize these lesions and compare the number of melanocytes between hypopigmented lesions and normal appearing skin. METHODS: We retrieved clinical data of the patients and performed 24 skin biopsies (13 from hypopigmented skin and 11 from normal-appearing skin) within a cohort of 41 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib. We classified the biopsies into three patterns. RESULTS: About 45% of patients presented with periocular hypopigmentation. Perifollicular fibrosis was observed in hypopigmented skin biopsies (76.9%) and in normal-appearing skin (45.5%). Epidermal melanin, as determined with Masson-Fontana staining, and melanocyte number, as evaluated with MiTF, Melan A and c-kit immunostains, were lower in hypopigmented skin. CONCLUSIONS: Histopathologic study of hypopigmented macules demonstrates the presence of melanin with a statistically significant decrease in the number of melanocytes. Therefore, these findings differ from vitiligo, as melanocytes are present. Three histopathological patterns may be found, namely (a) perifollicular fibrosis, (b) lichen planopilaris-like and (c) apparently normal skin. One of the most striking histopathologic finding consisted of the presence of perifollicular fibrosis in both hypopigmented lesions and apparently normal skin.","['Llamas-Velasco, Mar', 'Fraga, Javier', 'Kutzner, Heinz', 'Steegmann, Juan Luis', 'Garcia-Diez, Amaro', 'Requena, Luis']","['Llamas-Velasco M', 'Fraga J', 'Kutzner H', 'Steegmann JL', 'Garcia-Diez A', 'Requena L']","['Department of Dermatology, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de La Princesa (IP), Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140226,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Melanins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypopigmentation/*chemically induced/*pathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Melanocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Skin Pigmentation/drug effects']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/12/24 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2013/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cup.12298 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2014 May;41(5):417-26. doi: 10.1111/cup.12298.

Numerous prognostic models exist for CMML, with more recent models incorporating prognostic mutations, such as those involving ASXL1. Other variables that seem to consistently affect outcomes include the degree of leucocytosis/monocytosis, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for CMML, while hypomethylating agents can be used for transplant-ineligible patients or those without suitable stem cell sources.

Strategies to downregulate BCL2 and shift the balance towards cellular demise are actively being explored. Therefore, we examined whether the investigational agent MLN2238 could inhibit the proteasomal machinery and induce CLL cell death while also downregulating BCL2. MLN2238-induced cell death was studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 28 CLL patients. MLN2238 produced a dose-dependent reduction in BCL2 and CLL cell viability with maximum cell death observed at a 50 nmol/l concentration by 48 h. Annexin-V staining, PARP1 and caspase-3 cleavage along with an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability were noted after cells were treated with MLN2238; however, apoptosis was only partially blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk. Furthermore, we observed enhanced anti-CLL effects in tumour cells treated with either a combination of MLN2238 and the BH3 mimetic AT-101 or MLN2238 and fludarabine.

These over-expressed LF receptors can be utilized for the transportation of Lf-conjugated drug or nanocarrier devices. The present study was aimed to develop PTX-loaded Lf-coupled solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for the treatment of lung cancer. PTX-loaded SLNs were prepared, characterized and then coupled with Lf using carbodiimide chemistry. The formulations were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, particle size, polydispersity index and zeta potential, whereas Lf conjugation was confirmed by FT-IR and (1)H NMR and efficiency of prepared system was evaluated by in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo evaluations. The ex vivo cytotoxicity studies on human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B, revealed superior anticancer activity of Lf-coupled SLNs than plain SLNs and free PTX. In vivo biodistribution studies showed higher concentrations of PTX accumulated in lungs via Lf-coupled SLNs than plain SLNs and free PTX. These studies suggested that Lf-coupled PTX-loaded SLNs could be used as potential targeting carrier for delivering anticancer drug to the lungs with the minimal side effects.","['Pandey, Vikas', 'Gajbhiye, Kavita Rai', 'Soni, Vandana']","['Pandey V', 'Gajbhiye KR', 'Soni V']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dr. Hari Singh Gour University , Sagar, Madhya Pradesh , India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140127,England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Bronchogenic/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Compounding', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*chemistry', 'Lung/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Particle Size', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Solubility', 'Surface Properties', 'Tissue Distribution']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10717544.2013.877100 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Deliv. 2015 Feb;22(2):199-205. doi: 10.3109/10717544.2013.877100.

Survival was examined using proportional hazards models. Treatment with cytarabine/anthracycline occurred in > 80% of patients without acute promeyelocytic leukemia (non-APL) < 60, but only about one-third of older non-APL patients. Ultimately, 27% of those < 60 received an allogeneic transplant. Thirty-seven percent of those < 40 and 4% of those >/= 80 were alive at the end of follow-up. About three-quarters of patients with APL received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and either an anthracycline or arsenic trioxide, with 71% surviving.

In this work, we used the cell-surface capturing method together with quantitative proteomics to investigate differences in the glycoproteomes of adriamycin-sensitive and adriamycin-resistant leukemia cells. Two quantitative methods, isotopic dimethyl labeling and SWATH, were used to quantify glycoproteins, and 35 glycoproteins were quantified by both methods. High correlation was observed between the glycoproteins quantified by the above two methods, and 15 glycoproteins displayed a consistent significant change trend in both sets of quantitative results. These 15 proteins included classical multidrug resistance-related glycoproteins such as ABCB1 as well as a set of novel glycoproteins that have not previously been reported to be associated with chemoresistance in leukemia cells. Further validation with quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting confirmed the proteomic screening results. Subsequent functional experiments based on RNA interference technology showed that CTSD, FKBP10, and SLC2A1 are novel genes that participate in the acquisition and maintenance of the adriamycin-resistant phenotype in leukemia cells.","['Sun, Zhen', 'Dong, Jiaqiang', 'Zhang, Song', 'Hu, Zhengyan', 'Cheng, Kai', 'Li, Kai', 'Xu, Bo', 'Ye, Mingliang', 'Nie, Yongzhan', 'Fan, Daiming', 'Zou, Hanfa']","['Sun Z', 'Dong J', 'Zhang S', 'Hu Z', 'Cheng K', 'Li K', 'Xu B', 'Ye M', 'Nie Y', 'Fan D', 'Zou H']","['Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, National Chromatographic R&A Center, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140203,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (CTSD protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (FKBP10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cathepsin D/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Software', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,2014/01/29 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr4010822 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2014 Mar 7;13(3):1593-601. doi: 10.1021/pr4010822.

Apoptosis regulation of three main Ph+ cells types from CML patients depends on alternation sequences of proliferation (1) and maturation (2) cell stages and realized by two ways. The first one is performed by consecutive blocking and inducing apoptosis under 2/1/2 stage alternation. The way is not described early. Neutrophils accumulation correlates with apoprosis blocking. Apoptosis level enhances under neutrophils exhausted. Apoptosis blockage allows cells to proliferate and, thus, to form new portion of neutrophils with consecutive regular their death as well a consequent alternation of apoptosis blocking and inducing. This way regulates proliferation efficiency indexes P/D that reflect Ph+ cells proliferating potential and performs cycle completion for proliferation and differentiation. The second way of apoptosis regulation starts from proliferation stage and performs for 1/2/1 alternations under diminished content of neutrophils and a little increase under next maturation. It leads to resistant depressed apoptosis levels that, at maximal points, are 3-8 times lower than those under alternation 2/1/2. Resistant apoptosis blocking is observed in the Ph+ cells with prolong proliferation or maturation stages, when blasts and myelosytes are accumulated under enhanced bcr/abl and bcl2 > box gene expression and remain under next maturation. Stable apoptosis blocking is accompanied by increasing amounts of blasts and myelocytes and enhancing bcr/abl and bcl 2 > bax expression. This is observed under CML progression.

About 90% of APL patients present with hemorrhagic complications due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). When APL is suspected, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment is recommended even before confirmation by molecular tests. Specific criteria for differentiating unconfirmed APL from other AML subtypes with DIC are currently lacking. We aimed to achieve the early diagnosis of APL from other AML types with DIC by restricting the DIC criteria. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 29 patients newly diagnosed with AML accompanied by DIC from January 2005 to January 2013. RESULTS: Fibrin degradation products (FDP) (77.7 microg/mL vs. 23.7 microg/mL, p=0.026), D-dimer (7,376.2 ng/mL vs. 1,315.2 ng/mL, p=0.018), and TIBC (264.4 microg/dL vs. 206.8 microg/dL, P=0.046) were higher, while fibrinogen (133.8 mg/dL vs. 373.2 mg/dL, p<0.001), WBC (14.988x10(9)/L vs. 70.755x10(9)/L, p=0.015), and ESR (7.1 mm/h vs. 50.0 mm/h, p <0.001) were lower in APL patients than in the patients with other AML subtypes. FDP >/=27 microg/mL, D-dimer >/=2,071 ng/mL, and fibrinogen </=279 mg/dL were our threshold values. These markers may be characteristic to APL and helpful in presumptive diagnosis. CONCLUSION: APL may be differentiated from other AML subtypes by core markers of DIC (FDP, D-dimer, and fibrinogen). We suggest that clinicians set new diagnostic thresholds by restricting the DIC criteria. These findings support the early initiation of ATRA, prior to confirmation by PML-RARA molecular testing.","['Lee, Hee-Jeong', 'Park, Hyung-Jin', 'Kim, Hyun-Wook', 'Park, Sang-Gon']","['Lee HJ', 'Park HJ', 'Kim HW', 'Park SG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131224,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC3894382,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/01/28 06:01,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2013.48.4.250 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2013 Dec;48(4):250-3. doi: 10.5045/br.2013.48.4.250.

Seventy-three percent of the investigated neuroblastoma cell lines and all four investigated primary tumor samples displayed concentrations that reduce cell viability by 50% in the range of the therapeutic plasma levels reported for SNS-032 (<754 nM). Sixty-two percent of the cell lines and two of the primary samples displayed concentrations that reduce cell viability by 90% in this concentration range. SNS-032 also impaired the growth of the multidrug-resistant cisplatin-adapted UKF-NB-3 subline UKF-NB-3(r)CDDP(1000) in mice. ABCB1 expression (but not ABCG2 expression) conferred resistance to SNS-032. The antineuroblastoma effects of SNS-032 did not depend on functional p53.

In conclusion, CDK7 and CDK9 represent promising drug targets and SNS-032 represents a potential treatment option for neuroblastoma including therapy-refractory cases.","['Loschmann, Nadine', 'Michaelis, Martin', 'Rothweiler, Florian', 'Zehner, Richard', 'Cinatl, Jaroslav', 'Voges, Yvonne', 'Sharifi, Mohsen', 'Riecken, Kristoffer', 'Meyer, Jochen', 'von Deimling, Andreas', 'Fichtner, Iduna', 'Ghafourian, Taravat', 'Westermann, Frank', 'Cinatl, Jindrich Jr']","['Loschmann N', 'Michaelis M', 'Rothweiler F', 'Zehner R', 'Cinatl J', 'Voges Y', 'Sharifi M', 'Riecken K', 'Meyer J', 'von Deimling A', 'Fichtner I', 'Ghafourian T', 'Westermann F', 'Cinatl J Jr']","['Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Centre for Molecular Processing and School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institut fur Rechtsmedizin, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Kent, United Kingdom.', 'Forschungsabteilung Zell- und Gentherapie, Interdisziplinare Klinik und Poliklinik fur Stammzelltransplantation, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg and Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg and Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Kent, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Tumor Genetics (B030), German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131201,United States,Transl Oncol,Translational oncology,101472619,,,,PMC3890703,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/01/28 06:01,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1593/tlo.13544 [doi]'],epublish,Transl Oncol. 2013 Dec 1;6(6):685-96. doi: 10.1593/tlo.13544. eCollection 2013 Dec 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tubulin-targeting property has lead researchers to investigate the potential of colchicine and analogs as possible cancer therapies. One major study conducted on an analogue of allocolchicine, ZD 6126, was halted in phase 2 clinical trials due to severe cardio-toxicity associated with treatment. This study involves the development and testing of novel allocolchicine analogues that hold non-toxic anti-cancer properties. Currently we have synthesized and evaluated the anti-cancer activities of two analogues; N-acetyl-O-methylcolchinol (NSC 51046 or NCME), which is structurally similar to ZD 6126, and (S)-3,8,9,10-tetramethoxyallocolchicine (Green 1), which is a novel derivative of allocolchicine that is isomeric in the A ring. NSC 51046 was found to be non-selective as it induced apoptosis in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells and in normal human fibroblasts. Interestingly, we found that Green 1 was able to modestly induce pro-death autophagy in these pancreatic cancer cells and E6-1 leukemia cells but not in normal human fibroblasts. Unlike colchicine and NSC 51046, Green 1 does not appear to affect tubulin polymerization indicating that it has a different molecular target. Green 1 also caused increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria isolated from pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed that Green 1 was well tolerated in mice. Our findings suggest that a small change in the structure of colchicine has apparently changed the mechanism of action and lead to improved selectivity. This may lead to better selective treatments in cancer therapy.","['Larocque, Kristen', 'Ovadje, Pamela', 'Djurdjevic, Sinisa', 'Mehdi, Mariam', 'Green, James', 'Pandey, Siyaram']","['Larocque K', 'Ovadje P', 'Djurdjevic S', 'Mehdi M', 'Green J', 'Pandey S']","['Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Onatrio, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Onatrio, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Onatrio, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Onatrio, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Onatrio, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Onatrio, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (3,8,9,10-tetramethoxyallocolchicine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NSC 51046)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tubulin)', '641-28-1 (allocolchicine)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colchicine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Necrosis', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",PMC3900699,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0087064 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-34442 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 23;9(1):e87064. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0087064. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in neutrophil survival, but there is no evidence that these are linked in neutrophils. We hypothesized that CpG DNA could simultaneously activate these pathways. High purity CpG DNA (0.4-3.2 microg/ml) extended the life span of human neutrophils in vitro by delaying apoptosis through altering the rate of Mcl-1 turnover. CpG DNA slightly decreased Mcl-1 protein level in the presence of cyclohexmide and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had little effect on Mcl-1 expression in CpG DNA-treated neutrophils. In contrast, CpG DNA evoked rapid increases in DNA binding by NF-kappaB/p65 and Mcl-1 mRNA. NF-kappaB inhibitors and the telomere-derived TLR9 inhibitory oligonucleotide 5'-TTT AGG GTT AGG GTT AGG G-3' markedly reduced Mcl-1 protein levels and subsequently abrogated suppression of apoptosis by CpG DNA. Furthermore, CpG DNA attenuated the decreases in Mcl-1 in both cell lysate and nucleus of neutrophils undergoing spontaneous apoptosis and increased Mcl-1 translocation to the mitochondria, leading to preservation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. These results demonstrate that CpG DNA through toll-like receptor 9 links two survival signaling pathways by delaying apoptosis through induction of NF-kappaB-mediated Mcl-1 gene transcription and promoting Mcl-1 translocation to the mitochondria.","['El Kebir, Driss', 'Damlaj, Anas', 'Filep, Janos G']","['El Kebir D', 'Damlaj A', 'Filep JG']","['Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Bacterial/immunology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*metabolism']",PMC3899359,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0087006 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-41006 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 22;9(1):e87006. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0087006. eCollection 2014.,,,,['MOP-97742/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We encountered unusual cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitosis in Japanese native fowls infected with subgroup A of the avian leukosis viruses (ALVs-A), which belong to the genus Alpharetrovirus of the family Retroviridae and mainly induce lymphoid neoplasm in chickens. The affected hearts were evaluated by histopathology and immunohistochemistry, viral isolation, viral genome sequencing and experimental infection. There was non-suppurative myocarditis in eighteen fowls and seven of them had abnormal cardiomyocytes, which were distributed predominantly in the left ventricular wall and showed hypertrophic cytoplasm and atypical large nuclei. Nuclear chains and mitosis were frequently noted in these cardiomyocytes and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen supported the enhancement of mitotic activity. ALVs were isolated from all affected cases and phylogenic analysis of envSU genes showed that the isolates were mainly classified into two different clusters, suggesting viral genome diversity. In ovo experimental infection with two of the isolates was demonstrated to cause myocarditis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy similar to those in the naturally occurring lesions and cardiac hamartoma (rhabdomyoma) in a shorter period of time (at 70 days of age) than expected. These results indicate that ALVs cause myocarditis as well as cardiomyocyte abnormality in chickens, implying a pathogenetic mechanism different from insertional mutagenesis and the existence of retrovirus-induced heart disorder.","['Nakamura, Sayuri', 'Ochiai, Kenji', 'Ochi, Akihiro', 'Yabushita, Hiroki', 'Abe, Asumi', 'Kishi, Sayaka', 'Sunden, Yuji', 'Umemura, Takashi']","['Nakamura S', 'Ochiai K', 'Ochi A', 'Yabushita H', 'Abe A', 'Kishi S', 'Sunden Y', 'Umemura T']","['Laboratory of Comparative Pathology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Comparative Pathology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Miho Training Center, Japan Racing Association, Utsunomiya, Japan.', 'Medical School, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Kenpoku Meat Hygiene Inspection Institute, Tochigi Prefecture, Ohtawara, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Comparative Pathology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Comparative Pathology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Comparative Pathology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/complications/pathology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Cardiomegaly/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Chickens/virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Myocarditis/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Rhabdomyoma/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3900567,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0086546 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-40960 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 23;9(1):e86546. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0086546. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, thrombocytopenia occurred in most of ATO-treated patients with APL or other malignant diseases, and the pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that ATO dose-dependently induces depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, caspase-3 activation, and phosphotidylserine (PS) exposure in platelets. ATO did not induce surface expression of P-selectin and PAC-1 binding, whereas, obviously reduced collagen, ADP, and thrombin induced platelet aggregation. ATO dose-dependently induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and JNK specific inhibitor dicumarol obviously reduced ATO-induced DeltaPsim depolarization in platelets. Clinical therapeutic dosage of ATO was intraperitoneally injected into C57 mice, and the numbers of circulating platelets were significantly reduced after five days of continuous injection. The data demonstrate that ATO induces caspase-dependent apoptosis via JNK activation in platelets. ATO does not incur platelet activation, whereas, it not only impairs platelet function but also reduces circulating platelets in vivo, suggesting the possible pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in patients treated with ATO.","['Wu, Yicun', 'Dai, Jin', 'Zhang, Weilin', 'Yan, Rong', 'Zhang, Yiwen', 'Ruan, Changgeng', 'Dai, Kesheng']","['Wu Y', 'Dai J', 'Zhang W', 'Yan R', 'Zhang Y', 'Ruan C', 'Dai K']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3899281,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0086445 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30432 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 22;9(1):e86445. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0086445. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth arrest specific 2 (GAS2) regulates multiple cellular functions including cell cycle, apoptosis and calpain activities. In the present study, we found GAS2 was up-regulated in CML cells including CD34+ progenitor cells compared to their normal counterparts. We utilized RNAi and the expression of dominant negative form of GAS2 (GAS2DN) to target GAS2, which resulted in calpain activity enhancement and growth inhibition of both K562 and MEG-01 cells. Targeting GAS2 also sensitized K562 cells to Imatinib mesylate (IM). GAS2DN suppressed the tumorigenic ability of MEG-01 cells and impaired the tumour growth as well. Moreover, the CD34+ cells from CML patients and healthy donors were transduced with control and GAS2DN lentiviral vectors, and the CD34+ transduced (YFP+) progeny cells (CD34+YFP+) were plated for colony-forming cell (CFC) assay. The results showed that GAS2DN inhibited the CFC production of CML cells by 57+/-3% (n = 3), while affected those of normal hematopoietic cells by 31+/-1% (n = 2). Next, we found the inhibition of CML cells by GAS2DN was dependent on calpain activity but not the degradation of beta-catenin. Lastly, we generated microarray data to identify the differentially expressed genes upon GAS2DN and validated that the expression of HNRPDL, PTK7 and UCHL5 was suppressed by GAS2DN. These 3 genes were up-regulated in CML cells compared to normal control cells and the growth of K562 cells was inhibited upon HNRPDL silence. Taken together, we have demonstrated that GAS2 is up-regulated in CML cells and the inhibition of GAS2 impairs the growth of CML cells, which indicates GAS2 is a novel regulator of CML cells and a potential therapeutic target of this disease.","['Zhou, Haixia', 'Ge, Yue', 'Sun, Lili', 'Ma, Wenjuan', 'Wu, Jie', 'Zhang, Xiuyan', 'Hu, Xiaohui', 'Eaves, Connie J', 'Wu, Depei', 'Zhao, Yun']","['Zhou H', 'Ge Y', 'Sun L', 'Ma W', 'Wu J', 'Zhang X', 'Hu X', 'Eaves CJ', 'Wu D', 'Zhao Y']","['The First Affiliated Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, P.R.

It is thus conceivable that this newly identified complex of heparanase and resistin exerts a stimulatory effect also in various inflammatory conditions known to be affected by the two proteins.","['Novick, Daniela', 'Barak, Sara', 'Ilan, Neta', 'Vlodavsky, Israel']","['Novick D', 'Barak S', 'Ilan N', 'Vlodavsky I']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Cancer and Vascular Biology Research Center, The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer and Vascular Biology Research Center, The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Resistin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glucuronidase/isolation & purification/*metabolism/urine', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Resistin/*metabolism', 'Silver Staining', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",PMC3897609,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/10/30 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085944 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-32251 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 21;9(1):e85944. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085944. eCollection 2014.,,,,"['R01 CA106456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made transgenic mice with enforced expression of Lmo2 in T-cells by the CD2 promoter/enhancer. These transgenic mice developed highly penetrant T-ALL by two distinct patterns of gene expression: one in which there was concordant activation of Lyl1, Hhex, and Mycn or alternatively, with Notch1 target gene activation. Most strikingly, this gene expression clustering was conserved in human Early T-cell Precursor ALL (ETP-ALL), where LMO2, HHEX, LYL1, and MYCN were most highly expressed. We discovered that HHEX is a direct transcriptional target of LMO2 consistent with its concordant gene expression. Furthermore, conditional inactivation of Hhex in CD2-Lmo2 transgenic mice markedly attenuated T-ALL development, demonstrating that Hhex is a crucial mediator of Lmo2's oncogenic function. The CD2-Lmo2 transgenic mice offer mechanistic insight into concordant oncogene expression and provide a model for the highly treatment-resistant ETP-ALL subtype.","['Smith, Stephen', 'Tripathi,

A comparison of the sequence of ALV-J epidemic isolates with HPRS-103, the ALV-J prototype virus, revealed several distinct features, one of which is a 19-nucleotide (nt) insertion in the leader sequence. To determine the role of the 19-nt insertion in ALV-J pathogenicity, a pair of viruses were constructed and rescued. The first virus was an ALV-J Chinese isolate (designated rSD1009) containing the 19-nt insertion in its leader sequence. The second virus was a clone, in which the leader sequence had a deleted 19-nt sequence (designated rSD1009 big up tri, open19). Compared with rSD1009 big up tri, open19, rSD1009 displayed a moderate growth advantage in vitro. However, no differences were demonstrated in either viral replication or oncogenicity between the two rescued viruses in chickens. These results indicated that the 19-nt insertion contributed to ALV-J replication in vitro but was not related to its pathogenicity in vivo.","['Ji, Xiaolin', 'Wang, Qi', 'Li, Xiaofei', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Ji X', 'Wang Q', 'Li X', 'Qi X', 'Wang Y', 'Gao H', 'Gao Y', 'Wang X']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140120,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Poultry Diseases/virology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Virulence/genetics/physiology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/physiology']",PMC3896346,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084797 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-37601 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 20;9(1):e84797. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084797. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, obtaining the 3D shape of chromosomes of a genome is critical for understanding how the genome folds, functions and how its genes interact and are regulated. Here, we describe a method to reconstruct preferred 3D structures of individual chromosomes of the human genome from chromosomal contact data generated by the Hi-C chromosome conformation capturing technique. A novel parameterized objective function was designed for modeling chromosome structures, which was optimized by a gradient descent method to generate chromosomal structural models that could satisfy as many intra-chromosomal contacts as possible. We applied the objective function and the corresponding optimization method to two Hi-C chromosomal data sets of both a healthy and a cancerous human B-cell to construct 3D models of individual chromosomes at resolutions of 1 MB and 200 KB, respectively. The parameters used with the method were calibrated according to an independent fluorescence in situ hybridization experimental data. The structural models generated by our method could satisfy a high percentage of contacts (pairs of loci in interaction) and non-contacts (pairs of loci not in interaction) and were compatible with the known two-compartment organization of human chromatin structures. Furthermore, structural models generated at different resolutions and from randomly permuted data sets were consistent.","['Trieu, Tuan', 'Cheng, Jianlin']","['Trieu T', 'Cheng J']","['Computer Science Department, University of Missouri-Columbia, MO 65211, USA, Informatics Institute, University of Missouri-Columbia, MO 65211, USA and C.

An artificial protein composed of the two targeting modules and an interaction domain for AF4-family coactivators can functionally substitute for MLL fusion proteins. Because H3K36me2/3 markers are indicative of active transcription, MLL fusion proteins target previously active CpG-rich genes and activate transcription by recruiting coactivators thereto.

In both cell types, approximately half the integrations were found in <2% of the genome, demonstrating genomic influences even narrower than previously believed. The integration pattern of murine leukemia virus appears to be largely driven by regions that have high enrichment for multiple marks of active chromatin; the combination of histone marks present was sufficient to explain why some strong enhancers were more prone to integration than others.

This study was designed as a prospective validation of the purported reduction in WMV, associated influential factors, and its relationship to neurocognitive deficits in a very large cohort of both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and malignant brain tumors (BT) survivors in comparison to an age similar cohort of healthy sibling controls. PROCEDURES: The effects of host characteristics and CNS treatment intensity on WMV were investigated in 383 childhood cancer survivors (199 ALL, 184 BT) at least 12 months post-completion of therapy and 67 healthy siblings that served as a control group. t-Tests and multiple variable linear models were used to assess cross-sectional WMV and its relation with neurocognitive function. RESULTS: BT survivors had lower WMV than ALL survivors, who had less than the control group. Increased CNS treatment intensity, younger age at treatment, and greater time since treatment were significantly associated with lower WMV. Additionally, cancer survivors did not perform as well as the control group on neurocognitive measures of intelligence, attention, and academic achievement. Reduced WMV had a larger impact on estimated IQ among females and children treated at a younger age. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood cancer that have undergone higher intensity therapy at a younger age have significantly less WMV than their peers and this difference increases with time since therapy. Decreased WMV is associated with significantly lower scores in intelligence, attention, and academic performance in survivors.","['Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Taghipour, Delaram J', 'Glass, John O', 'Ashford, Jason', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Bonner, Melanie', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Conklin, Heather M']","['Reddick WE', 'Taghipour DJ', 'Glass JO', 'Ashford J', 'Xiong X', 'Wu S', 'Bonner M', 'Khan RB', 'Conklin HM']","[""Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140125,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Brain/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence', 'Learning Disabilities/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Leukoencephalopathies/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methylphenidate/therapeutic use', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Organ Size', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation Injuries/epidemiology/etiology/psychology', 'Risk', '*Survivors/psychology']",PMC4053257,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24947 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jun;61(6):1074-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24947.

One possible approach is to provide the research community with several petabyte-scale cloud-based computing platforms containing these data, along with tools and resources to analyze it. METHODS: Bionimbus is an open source cloud-computing platform that is based primarily upon OpenStack, which manages on-demand virtual machines that provide the required computational resources, and GlusterFS, which is a high-performance clustered file system. Bionimbus also includes Tukey, which is a portal, and associated middleware that provides a single entry point and a single sign on for the various Bionimbus resources; and Yates, which automates the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the software infrastructure required. RESULTS: Bionimbus is used by a variety of projects to process genomics and phenotypic data. For example, it is used by an acute myeloid leukemia resequencing project at the University of Chicago. The project requires several computational pipelines, including pipelines for quality control, alignment, variant calling, and annotation. For each sample, the alignment step requires eight CPUs for about 12 h. BAM file sizes ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB for each sample. CONCLUSIONS: Most members of the research community have difficulty downloading large genomics datasets and obtaining sufficient storage and computer resources to manage and analyze the data. Cloud computing platforms, such as Bionimbus, with data commons that contain large genomics datasets, are one choice for broadening access to research data in genomics.","['Heath, Allison P', 'Greenway, Matthew', 'Powell, Raymond', 'Spring, Jonathan', 'Suarez, Rafael', 'Hanley, David', 'Bandlamudi, Chai', 'McNerney, Megan E', 'White, Kevin P', 'Grossman, Robert L']","['Heath AP', 'Greenway M', 'Powell R', 'Spring J', 'Suarez R', 'Hanley D', 'Bandlamudi C', 'McNerney ME', 'White KP', 'Grossman RL']","['Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA Computation Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA Computation Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA Section of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140124,England,J Am Med Inform Assoc,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,,IM,"['*Computer Systems', '*Datasets as Topic', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Phenotype', '*Software', 'Systems Integration']",PMC4215034,2014/01/28 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['amiajnl-2013-002155 [pii]', '10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002155 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2014 Nov-Dec;21(6):969-75. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002155.

This study analyzed the effect of LIF on osteoblast differentiation using primary murine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Colony-forming unit-osteoblast formation by BMSCs was significantly suppressed by LIF treatment. To clarify the mechanism underlying the LIF suppressive effect on osteoblast differentiation, we analyzed the downstream signaling pathway of LIF. LIF/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling induces the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). SOCS3 knockdown experiments have previously demonstrated that short-hairpin SOCS3-BMSCs reversed the LIF suppressive effect. Our results demonstrated that LIF suppresses osteoblast differentiation through the LIF/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway.","['Matsushita, Kenta', 'Itoh, Shousaku', 'Ikeda, Shun', 'Yamamoto, Yumiko', 'Yamauchi, Yukako', 'Hayashi, Mikako']","['Matsushita K', 'Itoh S', 'Ikeda S', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Yamauchi Y', 'Hayashi M']","['Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'beta Catenin/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24777 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2014 Jul;115(7):1262-8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24777.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS', 'CELL DIFFERENTIATION', 'CYTOKINE', 'OSTEOBLASTS', 'SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION']",,,,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

We have shown that the c-Myc promoter quadruplex-forming sequence Pu-27 selectively kills transformed cells (Sedoris, K. C., Thomas, S. D., Clarkson, C. R., Muench, D., Islam, A., Singh, R., and Miller, D. M. (2012) Genomic c-Myc quadruplex DNA selectively kills leukemia. Mol. Cancer Ther. 11, 66-76). In this study, we show that Pu-27 induces profound DNA damage, resulting in striking chromosomal abnormalities in the form of chromatid or chromosomal breaks, radial formation, and telomeric DNA loss, which induces gamma-H2AX in U937 cells. Pu-27 down-regulates telomeric shelterin proteins, DNA damage response mediators (RAD17 and RAD50), double-stranded break repair molecule 53BP1, G2 checkpoint regulators (CHK1 and CHK2), and anti-apoptosis gene survivin. Interestingly, there are no changes of DNA repair molecules H2AX, BRCA1, and the telomere maintenance gene, hTERT. DeltaB-U937, where U937 cells stably transfected with deleted basic domain of TRF2 is partially sensitive to Pu-27 but exhibits no changes in expression of shelterin proteins. However, there is an up-regulation of CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, BRCA1, and survivin. Telomere dysfunction-induced foci assay revealed co-association of TRF1with gamma-H2AX in ATM deficient cells, which are differentially sensitive to Pu-27 than ATM proficient cells. Alt (alternating lengthening of telomere) cells are relatively resistant to Pu-27, but there are no significant changes of telomerase activity in both Alt and non-Alt cells. Lastly, we show that this Pu-27-mediated sensitivity is p53-independent. The data therefore support two conclusions. First, Pu-27 induces DNA damage within both telomeric and nontelomeric regions of the genome. Second, Pu-27-mediated telomeric damage is due, at least in part, to compromise of the telomeric shelterin protein complex.","['Islam, Md Ashraful', 'Thomas, Shelia D', 'Murty, Vundavalli V', 'Sedoris, Kara J', 'Miller, Donald M']","['Islam MA', 'Thomas SD', 'Murty VV', 'Sedoris KJ', 'Miller DM']","['From the Department of Medicine and Molecular Targets Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky 40202 and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140124,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', '*G-Quadruplexes', '*Genes, myc', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3961676,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/05/28 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)52349-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.505073 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Mar 21;289(12):8521-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.505073.

MDS occurs more frequently in older male and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry or molecular genetics is complementary but not diagnostic. RISK-STRATIFICATION: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly used system is the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). IPSS is likely to be replaced by a new revised score (IPSS-R) and by the incorporation of new molecular markers recently described. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts and more recently cytogenetic profile. Goals of therapy are different in lower risk patients than in higher risk. In lower risk, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML, as well as to improve survival. In higher risk, the goal is to prolong survival. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in patients with lower risk disease, anemia, and a chromosome 5 alteration. 5-Azacitidine and decitabine have activity in higher risk MDS. 5-Azacitidine has been shown to improve survival in higher risk MDS. A number of new molecular lesions have been described in MDS that may serve as new therapeutic targets or aid in the selection of currently available agents. Additional supportive care measures may include the use of prophylactic antibiotics and iron chelation. MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE OR REFRACTORY DISEASE: There are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after hypomethylating based therapy. Options include cytarabine based therapy, transplantation and participation on a clinical trial.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']",['Garcia-Manero G'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23642 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Jan;89(1):97-108. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23642.,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood or bone marrow cells were collected from 134 AML children aged </=15 years. Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper cards were used to transfer dried blood samples from five Iraqi hospitals to Japan. DNA sequencing was performed to identify class I mutations. Nested RT-PCR was used to detect class II aberrations, except that MLL rearrangement was detected according to long distance inverse-PCR. NPM1 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations were analyzed by GeneScan using DNA template. Among 134 Iraqi pediatric AML samples, the most prevalent FAB subtype was M2 (33.6 %) followed by M3 (17.9 %). Class I mutations: 20 (14.9 %), 8 (6.0 %), and 8 (6.0 %) patients had FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and KIT mutations, respectively. Class II mutations: 24 (17.9 %), 19 (14.2 %), and 9 (6.7 %) children had PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11 transcripts, respectively. MLL rearrangements were detected in 25 (18.7 %) patients. NPM1 mutation was detected in seven (5.2 %) cases. Collectively, approximately 30 % of AML children were proved to carry favorable prognostic genetic abnormalities, whereas approximately 10 % had high FLT3-ITD allelic burden and needed a special treatment plan including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was frequent among Iraqi pediatric AML. It is likely that molecular diagnosis using FTA cards in underdeveloped countries could guide doctors towards an appropriate treatment strategy.","[""Al-Kzayer, Lika'a Fasih Y"", 'Uyen, Le Thanh N', 'Al-Jadiry, Mazin Faisal', 'Al-Hadad, Salma Abbas', 'Al-Badri, Safaa A Faraj', 'Ghali, Hasanein Habeeb', 'Ameen, Najiha Ahmed', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Abdulkadhim, Jaafar M H', 'Al-Shujairi, Tariq Abadi', 'Matti, Zead Ismael I K', 'Hasan, Janan Ghalib', 'Al-Abdullah, Hussam M Salih', 'Al-Ani, Mouroge H', 'Saber, Paiman Ali I', 'Khalil, Hisham Maree', 'Inoshita, Toshi', 'Kamata, Minoru', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Sakashita, Kazuo']","['Al-Kzayer LF', 'Uyen le TN', 'Al-Jadiry MF', 'Al-Hadad SA', 'Al-Badri SA', 'Ghali HH', 'Ameen NA', 'Liu T', 'Matsuda K', 'Abdulkadhim JM', 'Al-Shujairi TA', 'Matti ZI', 'Hasan JG', 'Al-Abdullah HM', 'Al-Ani MH', 'Saber PA', 'Khalil HM', 'Inoshita T', 'Kamata M', 'Koike K', 'Sakashita K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Nagano, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140125,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Blood Specimen Collection/instrumentation/methods', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iraq', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Paper', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Specimen Handling/instrumentation/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2007-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Jun;93(6):949-55. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2007-2.

Based chiefly on findings from a phase Ib/II study, ibrutinib has been approved in the USA for the treatment of MCL in previously treated patients and is one of the first approvals through the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation Pathway. An application has been filed in the EU seeking regulatory approval in this indication. In both the USA and EU, further applications have been filed with regulatory bodies seeking approval for the use of ibrutinib in patients with previously treated CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Phase III trials are underway worldwide to evaluate ibrutinib in the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL, DLBCL and MCL, and the agent is in phase II development for use in WM, FL and MM. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ibrutinib leading to its first approval in MCL.","['Cameron, Fiona', 'Sanford, Mark']","['Cameron F', 'Sanford M']","['Adis R & D Insight, 41 Centorian Drive, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, North Shore, 0754, Auckland, New Zealand, dru@adis.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*drug therapy']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2015/01/08 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40265-014-0178-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2014 Feb;74(2):263-71. doi: 10.1007/s40265-014-0178-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known regarding the mechanisms whereby CLL cells create their favorable microenvironment for survival. High-mobility group protein B-1 (HMGB1) is a highly conserved nuclear protein that can be actively secreted by innate immune cells and passively released by injured or dying cells. We found significantly increased HMGB1 levels in the plasma of CLL patients compared with healthy controls, and HMGB1 concentration is associated with absolute lymphocyte count. We therefore sought to determine potential roles of HMGB1 in modulating the CLL microenvironment. CLL cells passively released HMGB1, and the timing and concentrations of HMGB1 in the medium were associated with differentiation of nurse-like cells (NLCs). Higher CD68 expression in CLL lymph nodes, one of the markers for NLCs, was associated with shorter overall survival of CLL patients. HMGB1-mediated NLC differentiation involved internalization of both receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9). Differentiation of NLCs can be prevented by blocking the HMGB1-RAGE-TLR9 pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that CLL cells might modulate their microenvironment by releasing HMGB1.","['Jia, Li', 'Clear, Andrew', 'Liu, Feng-Ting', 'Matthews, Janet', 'Uddin, Nadiha', 'McCarthy, Aine', 'Hoxha, Elena', 'Durance, Catherine', 'Iqbal, Sameena', 'Gribben, John G']","['Jia L', 'Clear A', 'Liu FT', 'Matthews J', 'Uddin N', 'McCarthy A', 'Hoxha E', 'Durance C', 'Iqbal S', 'Gribben JG']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140124,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HMGB1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC3954052,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35894-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-529610 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 13;123(11):1709-19. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-529610.

Previous studies showed that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is activated in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells, but the mechanism of activation and importance of NF-kappaB to the pathogenesis of BCR-ABL1-positive myeloid and lymphoid leukemias are unknown. Coexpression of BCR-ABL1 and a superrepressor mutant of inhibitory NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaBalphaSR) blocked nuclear p65/RelA expression and inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and primary BCR-ABL1-transformed B lymphoblasts without affecting cell survival. In retroviral mouse models of CML and B-ALL, coexpression of IkappaBalphaSR attenuated leukemogenesis, prolonged survival, and reduced myeloid leukemic stem cells. Coexpression of dominant-negative mutants of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha)/IKK1 or IKKbeta/IKK2 also inhibited lymphoid and myeloid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1. Blockade of NF-kappaB decreased expression of the NF-kappaB targets c-MYC and BCL-X and increased the sensitivity of BCR-ABL1-transformed lymphoblasts to ABL1 kinase inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NF-kappaB is activated through the canonical IKK pathway and plays distinct roles in the pathogenesis of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias induced by BCR-ABL1, validating NF-kappaB and IKKs as targets for therapy of Ph(+) leukemias.","['Hsieh, Mo-Ying', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Hsieh MY', 'Van Etten RA']","['Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140124,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbkb protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC3983614,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35775-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-01-547943 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Apr 10;123(15):2401-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-01-547943.

EAPB0503 proved more potent and induced a specific cell cycle arrest in mitosis in CML cells and direct activation of apoptosis as evidenced by increased pre-G0 population, breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential, PARP cleavage, and DNA breakage. Interestingly, EAPB0503 decreased BCR-ABL oncoprotein levels. The combination of EAPB0503 with imatinib synergized to inhibit the proliferation of CML cells, and most importantly, EABP0503 inhibited the proliferation of imatinib-resistant CML cells, offering promising therapeutic modalities that would circumvent resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and improve the prognosis of CML.","['Saliba, Jessica', 'Deleuze-Masquefa, Carine', 'Iskandarani, Ahmad', 'El Eit, Rabab', 'Hmadi, Raed', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Bonnet, Pierre-Antoine', 'Nasr, Rihab']","['Saliba J', 'Deleuze-Masquefa C', 'Iskandarani A', 'El Eit R', 'Hmadi R', 'Mahon FX', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Bonnet PA', 'Nasr R']","['Departments of aAnatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences bInternal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon cPharmacochemistry and Biomolecules Labs, Faculty of Pharmacy, Montpellier 1 University, Montpellier dHematology Lab and Blood Diseases Department, Bordeaux University Hospital, Victor Segalen University, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (EAPB0203)', '0 (EAPB0503)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000084 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2014 Jul;25(6):624-32. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000084.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring novel pathways in B-ALL could lead to new therapy. Our previous study has shown that stem cell factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in B-ALL, but its functional roles and the mechanism that accounts for its upregulation in B-ALL remain unexplored. To address this question, we first surveyed the existing B-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples for SALL4 expression. We then selected the B-ALL cell lines with the highest SALL4 expression for functional studies. RNA interference was used to downregulate SALL4 expression in these cell lines. When compared with control cells, SALL4 knockdown cells exhibited decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis in vitro, and decreased engraftment in a xenotransplant model in vivo. Gene expression analysis showed that in SALL4 knockdown B-ALL cells, multiple caspase members involved in cell apoptosis pathway were upregulated. Next, we explored the mechanisms of aberrant SALL4 expression in B-ALL. We found that hypomethylation of the SALL4 CpG islands was correlated with its high expression. Furthermore, treatment of low SALL4-expressing B-ALL cell lines with DNA methylation inhibitor led to demethylation of the SALL4 CpG and increased SALL4 expression. In summary, to our knowledge, we are the first to show that the aberrant expression of SALL4 in B-ALL is associated with hypomethylation, and that SALL4 plays a key role in B-ALL cell survival and could be a potential novel target in B-ALL treatment.","['Ueno, Shikiko', 'Lu, Jiayun', 'He, Jie', 'Li, Ailing', 'Zhang, Xiaoxian', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Silberstein, Leslie E', 'Chai, Li']","['Ueno S', 'Lu J', 'He J', 'Li A', 'Zhang X', 'Ritz J', 'Silberstein LE', 'Chai L']","[""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology/Blood Bank, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.

H(2)O(2) applied prior to (pre-conditioning) and during (post-conditioning) FasL stimulation attenuated early apoptosis through activation of EKR5. H(2)O(2) increased the activated caspase-8 sequestered in the mitochondria thereby decreasing cell death through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, inhibition of a protein tyrosine phosphatase likely explains the post-conditioning requirement for H(2)O(2).

Combined treatment with dicoumarol and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in various human renal carcinoma cells including Caki, ACHN, and A498, but not in normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1). When we elucidated the relevance of NQO1 in dicoumarol plus TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, both ES936 (a NQO1 inhibitor) and knockdown of NQO1 with siRNA had no effect on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the stimulating effect of dicoumarol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is independent of NQO1 activity. We found that dicoumarol transcriptionally down-regulated Bcl-2 expression via inhibition of NF-kappaB and CREB activity, whereas it down-regulated Mcl-1 and c-FLIP expression at the post-translational level. Overexpression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, or c-FLIP overcame the dicoumarol plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that down-regualtion of these anti-apoptotic proteins may critically contribute to the sensitizing effect of dicoumarol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.","['Park, Eun Jung', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Choi, Kyeong Sook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Park EJ', 'Min KJ', 'Choi KS', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University School of Medicine, 5 Woncheon-Dong, Paldal-Gu, Suwon 442-749, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.

The aim of the work described here was to study the effect of chlorin e6 (Ce6)-mediated SDT on human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Our results indicate that Ce6-mediated SDT can suppress the viability of K562 cells. SDT caused apoptosis as analyzed by annexin V-phycoerythrin/7-amino-actinomycin D staining as well as cleavage of caspase 3 and the polypeptide poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. After SDT exposure, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, translocation of Bax from cytoplasm to mitochondria and activation of caspase 9 indicated that the mitochondrial-related apoptotic pathway might be activated. This process was accompanied by rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scavenging of ROS significantly blocked caspase-3 expression and the killing effect of SDT on K562 cells. Stress-activated protein kinases c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were activated after SDT treatment. Together, these findings indicate that Ce6-mediated SDT triggers mitochondria- and caspase-dependent apoptosis; oxidative injury may play a vital role in apoptotic signaling cascades.","['Li, Yixiang', 'Wang, Pan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Su, Xiaomin', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Li Y', 'Wang P', 'Wang X', 'Su X', 'Liu Q']","['Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Shaanxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Shaanxi, China.

Therefore, for Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors (surviving victims who were exposed to ionizing radiation emitted from the nuclear weapons), several cancer-screening tests have been provided annually, with government support, to detect the early stage of malignancies. An M-protein screening test has been used to detect multiple myeloma at an early stage among atomic bomb survivors. In the screening process, a number of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), in addition to multiple myeloma, have been identified. In 2009 and 2011, we reported the age- and sex-specific prevalence of MGUS between 1988 and 2004 and the possible role of radiation exposure in the development of MGUS using the screening data of more than 1000 patients with MGUS among approximately 52,000 Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. The findings included: (1) a significant lower overall prevalence (2.1%) than that observed in Caucasian or African-origin populations; (2) a significantly higher prevalence in men than in women; (3) an age-related increase in the prevalence; (4) a significantly higher prevalence in people exposed to higher radiation doses only among those exposed at age 20 years or younger; and (5) a lower frequency of immunoglobulin M MGUS in Japanese patients than in patients in Western countries.

DNA polymerase kappa (Pol kappa) bypasses benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide-N(2)-deoxyguanine (BPDE-N(2)-dG) DNA adducts in an almost error-free manner. In the previous work, we changed the amino acids close to the adducts in the active site and examined the bypass efficiency. The substitution of alanine for phenylalanine 171 (F171A) enhanced by 18-fold in vitro, the efficiencies of dCMP incorporation opposite (-)- and (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N(2)-dG. In the present study, we established human cell lines that express wild-type Pol kappa (POLK+/-), F171A (POLK F171A/-) or lack expression of Pol kappa (POLK-/-) to examine the in vivo significance. These cell lines were generated with Nalm-6, a human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, which has high efficiency for gene targeting. Mutations were analyzed with shuttle vectors having (-)- or (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N(2)-dG in the supF gene. The frequencies of mutations were in the order of POLK-/->POLK+/->POLK F171A/- both in (-)- and (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N(2)-dG. These results suggest that F171 may function as a molecular brake for bypass across BPDE-N(2)-dG by Pol kappa and raise the possibility that the cognate substrates for Pol kappa are not BP adducts in DNA but may be lesions in DNA induced by endogenous mutagens.","['Sassa, Akira', 'Suzuki, Tetsuya', 'Kanemaru, Yuki', 'Niimi, Naoko', 'Fujimoto, Hirofumi', 'Katafuchi, Atsushi', 'Gruz, Petr', 'Yasui, Manabu', 'Gupta, Ramesh C', 'Johnson, Francis', 'Ohta, Toshihiro', 'Honma, Masamitsu', 'Adachi, Noritaka', 'Nohmi, Takehiko']","['Sassa A', 'Suzuki T', 'Kanemaru Y', 'Niimi N', 'Fujimoto H', 'Katafuchi A', 'Gruz P', 'Yasui M', 'Gupta RC', 'Johnson F', 'Ohta T', 'Honma M', 'Adachi N', 'Nohmi T']","['Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan; School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Radiological Protection and Biology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 1-23-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3400, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3400, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Nanobioscience, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.

Recently, MK was introduced as an independent predictor of dismal outcome in AML. The additional prognostic effect of C17 abns in patients with MK in a CK background is not clear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1086 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated between January 1998 and December 2007. Patients received treatment with one of the institution's first-line protocols. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-three patients had CK. Among them, 370 patients (77%) had CK-MK, and 195 patients (53%) had CK-MK-C17 abns. Patients with CK-MK had significantly shorter OS rates compared with patients with CK without MK (4.4 vs. 8 months, respectively; P = .002). The median OS for patients with CK-C17 abns was shorter than for patients without C17 abns (4 vs. 6.1 months, respectively; P = .004). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of MK among patients with CK was identified as an independent prognostic marker for OS. In addition, presence of C17 abns had a significant negative effect on OS among patients with CK-MK (P = .04). CONCLUSION: Among patients with CK-AML, MK was associated with poor outcomes. Additional presence of C17 abns further worsens the outcome in these particularly poor-risk patients with AML.","['Nazha, Aziz', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bhatt, Vijaya R', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez, Graciela', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Daver, Naval', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Keating, Michael', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Nazha A', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bhatt VR', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez G', 'Cortes JE', 'Kadia T', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Abruzzo L', 'Daver N', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Ravandi F', 'Keating M', 'Borthakur G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

However, the most recent studies have shown that the disease develops from plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the tumor has been renamed ""Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm"" (BPDCN). It is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis and behaves like acute leukemia in the short to moderate term. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 65-year-old man with no particular history consulted for a left laterocervical lesion of ecchymotic aspect that had appeared one year earlier. Topical corticosteroid therapy had been unsuccessful. Examination of biopsies with lymphocyte typing enabled a diagnosis of BPDCN to be made. At the histopathological level, biopsy showed an infiltrate comprising medium to large cells. Immunohistochemical examination was remarkable for the absence of expression of markers of T- and B-cell lines. However, these tumor cells expressed CD4, CD56 and TCL1. Staging of the disease was normal. Treatment with chemotherapy was initiated in collaboration with a team of hematologists. Autologous bone marrow transplant was then performed. DISCUSSION: BPDCN is a rare malignant blood dyscrasia. It is distinguished by inaugural skin involvement, with systemic manifestations occurring much later. Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy with immunostaining establishes the diagnosis. In terms of phenotype, the tumor population is highly characteristic. The cells are negative for antigens of T- and B- cell lines. However, these cells express CD4, CD56 and TCL1, which are markers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The disease carries a poor prognosis and evolves in the short to middle term in the same way as acute leukemia. First-line treatment consists of the chemotherapy regimens used in aggressive lymphoma or acute leukemia. A bone marrow graft is sometimes performed at the time of initial relapse. Average survival is 12 months for chemotherapy alone and 30 months for transplant after first relapse. Early bone marrow transplantation has been shown to improve survival.","['Ahogo, K-C', 'Wantz, M', 'Cliquennois, M', 'Gosset, P', 'Lebas, D', 'Modiano, P']","['Ahogo KC', 'Wantz M', 'Cliquennois M', 'Gosset P', 'Lebas D', 'Modiano P']","[""Service de dermatologie, hopital Saint-Vincent, boulevard de Belfort, BP 387, 59020 Lille cedex, France; Service de dermatologie, CHU de Treichville-Abidjan, BP V3 Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.

VDC-1101 (formerly GS-9219), a novel double prodrug of the anti-proliferative nucleotide analog 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine (PMEG), possesses potent cytotoxic activity in vitro in human lymphoblasts and leukemia cell lines and in vivo in spontaneous canine lymphoma. Given the similarity in lineage between lymphoma and MM, we hypothesized that VDC-1101 would be active against MM. RESULTS: We evaluated the in vitro antiproliferative effects of VDC-1101 against 3 human MM cell lines, and we performed a phase-II clinical trial in 14 dogs with spontaneous MM. Each dog was treated with a maximum of 6 doses of VDC-1101 monotherapy over 10-15 weeks. Dose-dependent antiproliferative activity was observed in all evaluated cell lines.

METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2012, 49 relapsed or refractory AML patients [36 men; 13 women; median age, 42 (range, 18-71) yr; patients aged >60 yr, 8] were treated with HAEP [high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m(2) ), etoposide (100 mg/m(2) ) and cisplatin (20 mg/m(2) ) for five alternative days] as salvage therapy. Patients who had the first relapse at <6 months after an initial complete remission (CR), had a second or subsequent relapse, were primary refractory to >/=2 courses of front-line conventional induction chemotherapy or were refractory to re-induction chemotherapy after any relapse was eligible for HAEP treatments. RESULTS: The overall CR + CR without platelet recovery (CRp) rates among 49 evaluable patients were 31% [95% confidence interval (CI), 17-44%]. Of the eight patients aged >/=60 yr, none showed any response to HAEP treatment. The CR + CRp rate was 54% in patients with second or greater relapse and 25% in patients refractory to re-induction therapy after relapse. In multivariate analysis, younger age, favourable cytogenetics and no prior salvage chemotherapy were independent predictors for better responses. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HAEP is an effective salvage chemotherapy for patients aged <60 yr with high-risk relapsed or refractory AML.","['Lee, Yun-Gyoo', 'Kwon, Ji-hyun', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung Soo', 'Lee, Jong-Seok', 'Park, Seongyang']","['Lee YG', 'Kwon JH', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Lee JS', 'Park S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140327,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12274 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2014 Jun;92(6):478-84. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12274.

This study was designed to investigate cytotoxic effects of S. striata extract, on the Jurkat human leukaemia cell line (T-cell leukaemia). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytochemical assay by thin layer chromatography and 2, 2 diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl were used to evaluate main compounds and antioxidant capacity of the plant extract, respectively. Its inhibitory effect on Jurkat cells was evaluated by MTT assay. In addition, cell cycle distribution and apoptotic cell death were evaluated by propidium iodide and annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide staining. RESULTS: These showed that the main components present in S. striata extract included flavonoids, phenolic compounds and phenyl propanoids. Treatment with extract was significantly cytotoxic to the tumour cell line. In addition, flow cytometry analysis indicated that S. striata extract induced cell cycle arrest in G2 /M phase and apoptosis of tumour cells. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study indicated that S. striata extract could inhibit leukaemia cell proliferation by inducing G2 /M phase arrest and apoptosis.","['Azadmehr, A', 'Hajiaghaee, R', 'Mazandarani, M']","['Azadmehr A', 'Hajiaghaee R', 'Mazandarani M']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, 3419759811, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Phenols/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Scrophularia/*chemistry']",PMC6496267,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cpr.12074 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2013 Dec;46(6):637-43. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12074.,,,,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,

(Boiss.) or Genista monosperma L. (Lam.), locally named as ""R'tam"", is an annual and spontaneous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. In Morocco, Retama genus is located in desert regions and across the Middle Atlas and it has been widely used in traditional medicine in many countries. In this study, we show that Retama monosperma hexane extract presents significant anti-leukemic effects against human Jurkat cells. METHODS: Human Jurkat cells, together with other cell lines were screened with different concentrations of Retama monosperma hexane extract at different time intervals. Growth inhibition was determined using luminescent-based viability assays. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry analysis. Combined caspase 3 and 7 activities were measured using luminometric caspase assays and immunoblots were performed to analyze expression of relevant pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. GC-MS were used to determine the chemical constituents of the active extract. RESULTS: Retama monosperma hexane extract (Rm-HE) showed significant cytotoxicity against Jurkat cells, whereas it proved to be essentially ineffective against both normal mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3) and normal lymphocytes (TK-6). Cytometric analysis indicated that Rm-HE promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction accompanied by DNA damage induction indicated by an increase in p-H2A.X levels. Rm-HE induced apoptosis was partially JNK-dependent and characterized by an increase in Fas-L levels together with activation of caspases 8, 3, 7 and 9, whereas neither the pro-apoptotic nor anti-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane proteins analyzed were significantly altered. Chemical identification analysis indicated that alpha-linolenic acid, campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol were the major bioactive components within the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that bioactive compounds present in Rm-HE show significant anti leukemic activity inducing cell cycle arrest and cell death that operates, at least partially, through the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.","['Belayachi, Lamiae', 'Aceves-Luquero, Clara', 'Merghoub, Nawel', 'Bakri, Youssef', 'Fernandez de Mattos, Silvia', 'Amzazi, Saaid', 'Villalonga, Priam']","['Belayachi L', 'Aceves-Luquero C', 'Merghoub N', 'Bakri Y', 'Fernandez de Mattos S', 'Amzazi S', 'Villalonga P']","[""Cancer Cell Biology Group, Institut Universitari d'Investigacio en Ciencies de la Salut (IUNICS), Edifici Cientificotecnic, Ctra Km 7,5, Valldemossa, Illes Balears, Spain. priam.villalonga@uib.es.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140124,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Phytosterols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sitosterols)', '0RBV727H71 (alpha-Linolenic Acid)', '5L5O665639 (campesterol)', '5LI01C78DD (gamma-sitosterol)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', '99WUK5D0Y8 (Stigmasterol)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fabaceae/*chemistry', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phytosterols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sitosterols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Stigmasterol/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'alpha-Linolenic Acid/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC3916308,2014/01/28 06:00,2015/10/09 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-14-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-14-38 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2014 Jan 24;14:38. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-14-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a specific survivin small interference RNA (siRNA) on proliferation and the sensitivity of HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cells were transfected with siRNAs using LipofectamineTM2000 transfection reagent. Relative survivin mRNA and protein levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Trypan blue exclusion assays were performed to monitor tumor cell proliferation after siRNA transfection. The cytotoxic effects of etoposide and survivin siRNA, alone and in combination, on leukemic cells were determined using MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by ELISA cell death assay. RESULTS: Survivin siRNA markedly reduced both mRNA and protein expression levels in a time-dependent manner, leading to distinct inhibition of cell proliferation and increased spontaneous apoptosis. Surprisingly, survivin siRNA synergistically increased the cell toxic effects of etoposide. Moreover, survivin down-regulation significantly enhanced its induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that down-regulation of survivin by siRNA can trigger apoptosis and overcome drug resistance of leukemia cells. Therefore, survivin siRNA may be an effective adjuvant in AML chemotherapy.","['Karami, Hadi', 'Baradaran, Behzad', 'Esfahani, Ali', 'Estiar, Mehrdad Asghari', 'Naghavi-Behzad, Mohammad', 'Sakhinia, Masoud', 'Sakhinia, Ebrahim']","['Karami H', 'Baradaran B', 'Esfahani A', 'Estiar MA', 'Naghavi-Behzad M', 'Sakhinia M', 'Sakhinia E']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran E-mail : baradaranb@tbzmed.ac.ir, esakhinia@yahoo.co.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.12.7719 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(12):7719-24. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.12.7719.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study apoptotic and autophagic types of cell death induced by terpinen-4-ol and associated mechanisms were investigated in human leukemic HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of human leukemic U937 and HL-60 cells was determined by MTT assay. Cytochrome c release, expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and cleaved Bid were determined by Western blotting. Cell morphology was examined under a transmission electron microscope. LC3-I/II, ATG5 and Beclin-1 levels were detected by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Terpinen-4-ol exhibited cytotoxicity to human leukemic HL-60 but not U937 cells. The apoptotic response to terpinen-4-ol in HL-60 cells was due to induction of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and cleavage of Bid protein after the stimulation of caspase-8. There was a slightly decrease of Bcl-xl protein level. The characteristic cell morphology of autophagic cell death was demonstrated with multiple autophagosomes in the cytoplasm. At the molecular level, the results from Western blot analysis showed that terpinen-4-ol significantly induced accumulation of LC3-I/II, ATG5 and Beclin-1, regulatory proteins required for autophagy in mammalian cells.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs within exosomes from cancer cells play crucial roles in initiation and progression. This study was performed to assess miRNAs within exosomes of K562 cells. METHODS: miRNA microarray analysis of K562 cells and K562 cell-derived exosomes was conducted with the 6th generation miRCURYTM LNA Array (v.16.0). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were also carried out. GO terms and signaling pathways were categorized into 66 classes (including homophilic cell adhesion, negative regulation of apoptotic process, cell adhesion) and 26 signaling pathways (such as Wnt). RESULTS: In exosomes, 49 miRNAs were up regulated as compared to K562 cells, and two of them were further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. There are differentially expressed miRNAs between K562 cell derived-exosomes and K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Selectively expressed miRNAs in exosomes may promote the development of CML via effects on interactions (e.g. adhesion) of CML cells with their microenvironment.","['Feng, Dan-Qin', 'Huang, Bo', 'Li, Jing', 'Liu, Jing', 'Chen, Xi-Min', 'Xu, Yan-Mei', 'Chen, Xin', 'Zhang, Hai-Bin', 'Hu, Long-Hua', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong']","['Feng DQ', 'Huang B', 'Li J', 'Liu J', 'Chen XM', 'Xu YM', 'Chen X', 'Zhang HB', 'Hu LH', 'Wang XZ']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China E-mail : wangxiaozhong@ncu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Exosomes/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.12.7501 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(12):7501-8. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.12.7501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of allergic diseases is associated with overactivation of Th2-skewed immunity. Basophils generate large amounts of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, which are critically involved in allergic inflammation. We investigated how EPA and DHA affect Th2 cytokine expression in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- and ionomycin (PI)-activated RBL-2H3 basophilic leukemia cells. EPA and DHA induced a dramatic decrease in the production of IL-4 and IL-13 and their transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Luciferase assays of RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing Il4 and Il13 promoter-reporter plasmids demonstrated a significant suppression of PI-induced promoter activation. Analysis of certain transcription factors revealed that nuclear expression of c-Fos and the mRNA expression were suppressed by EPA and DHA. Furthermore, they significantly inhibited the nuclear expression and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)1. In contrast, the expression levels of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), GATA-binding proteins (GATAs), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) were not significantly affected by EPA and DHA. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase was inhibited by EPA and DHA, and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was decreased by DHA, but not by EPA. Taken together, our data suggest that EPA and DHA may suppress Th2-skewed allergic immune responses by inhibiting the expression of basophilic IL-4 and IL-13.","['Jin, Mirim', 'Park, Sunyoung', 'Park, Bo-Kyung', 'Choi, Jeong June', 'Yoon, Soo Jeong', 'Yang, Mihi', 'Pyo, Myoung Yun']","['Jin M', 'Park S', 'Park BK', 'Choi JJ', 'Yoon SJ', 'Yang M', 'Pyo MY']","['1 Laboratory of Pathology, College of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon University , Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140124,United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,"['0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*drug effects/immunology']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jmf.2013.2935 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2014 Feb;17(2):198-205. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2013.2935.

In this study, we tested both antibodies in different skin and mast cell disorders with the aim of determining whether it was possible to differentiate between benign and aggressive presentations of mastocytosis. METHODS: Using the antibodies 2D7, BB1, and c-Kit, we performed an immunohistochemical study of skin biopsy specimens from patients with cutaneous mastocytosis (15 urticaria pigmentosa and telangiectatic macularis eruptive perstans) and liver or bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with systemic mastocytosis. A basophil leukemia cell line was used as a reference. Peripheral blood basophils from healthy donors were used as controls. RESULTS: We observed intense expression of 2D7 and BB1 in all skin biopsy specimens from patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. Immunostaining of liver and bone marrow specimens from patients with systemic mastocytosis with 2D7 and BB1 antibodies was negative. Specimens from patients with either type of mastocytosis showed similarly strong expression of c-Kit. The basophil cell line showed a 2D7 and a BB1 profile, with intense expression of c-Kit. Peripheral blood basophils exhibited notable immunostaining for 2D7, BB1, and c-Kit. CONCLUSIONS: 2D7 and BB1 are expressed in cutaneous mastocytosis, although this expression is lost when mast cell proliferation is systemic, thus reflecting either a different cellular differentiation stage or the presence of basophils in these skin diseases.","['Idoate, M A', 'Echeveste, J', 'Gil, P', 'Sanz, M L', 'Ferrer, M']","['Idoate MA', 'Echeveste J', 'Gil P', 'Sanz ML', 'Ferrer M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain', 'Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, School of Medicine, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, School of Medicine, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol,Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,9107858,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies/*immunology', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Basophils/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Cutaneous/*diagnosis', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged']",,2014/01/28 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2014/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol. 2013;23(6):392-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-3 also interacts with a number of transcriptional regulators, including homodimers of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit. Deletion of Bcl-3 results in increased NF-kappaB p50 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and increased inflammatory gene expression. We employed immobilized peptide array technology to define a region of p50 required for the formation of a Bcl-3.p50 homodimer immunosuppressor complex. Our data demonstrate that amino acids 359-361 and 363 of p50 are critical for interaction with Bcl-3 and essential for Bcl-3-mediated inhibition of inflammatory gene expression. Bcl-3 is unable to interact with p50 when these amino acids are mutated, rendering it incapable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. Bcl-3 interaction-defective p50 is hyperubiquitinated and has a significantly reduced half-life relative to wild-type p50. Nfkb1(-/-) cells reconstituted with mutated p50 precursor p105 are hyperresponsive to TNFalpha stimulation relative to wild-type p105, as measured by inflammatory gene expression. Mutant p105 recapitulates a Bcl3(-/-) phenotype. This study demonstrates that interaction with p50 is necessary and sufficient for the anti-inflammatory properties of Bcl-3 and further highlights the importance of p50 homodimer stability in the control of NF-kappaB target gene expression.","['Collins, Patricia E', 'Kiely, Patrick A', 'Carmody, Ruaidhri J']","['Collins PE', 'Kiely PA', 'Carmody RJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Life Sciences and the Materials and Surface Science Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow G12 8TA, Scotland, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

In this study AND2 was isolated from the plant Andrographis paniculata and it was characterized. The antiproliferative effect of AND2 on both adherent (PC-3 and MDAMB) and non-adherent (THP-1 and Jurkat) cancer cell lines was evaluated by MTT assay. The effect of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) on AND2-induced cytotoxicity was studied by conducting cell viability assays on GSH-pretreated cells. The effect of AND2 on the redox status of THP-1 cells was determined by analyzing the endogenous reduced GSH content. Apoptosis induction was confirmed by DNA laddering assay and Western blot analysis using anti-caspase-3 protein antibody. AND2 showed antiproliferative action on both THP-1 and Jurkat cancer cell lines with low IC50 values. Cytotoxicity of AND2 was reversed by GSH pretreatment. AND2 treatment decreased the GSH content by 19.76 % (p < 0.001) in the THP-1 cancer cell line and reduced the cell clumping between the THP-1 cells. Expression of procaspase-3 varied in THP-1 cells during the time course of AND2 treatment. Procaspase-3 expression reached a maximum in treated cells at 32 h and was markedly reduced at 48 h but no procaspase-3 cleavage was observed. The obtained results suggest that AND2 is more effective against leukemia cells. AND2 induced a redox-mediated cell death in THP-1 cells. As AND2 temporarily increased the procaspase-3 expression during treatment, this study encourages the preclinical testing of AND2 against promonocytic leukemia cells in combination with small molecules that directly activate procaspase-3 to caspase-3.","['Raghavan, Rahul', 'Cheriyamundath, Sanith', 'Madassery, Joseph']","['Raghavan R', 'Cheriyamundath S', 'Madassery J']","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Calicut, Calicut University P.O., Malappuram district, Kerala, 673635, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140124,Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Andrographis/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11418-014-0815-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Med. 2014 Apr;68(2):387-94. doi: 10.1007/s11418-014-0815-2.

Here, we borrow ideas from the OASIS methods in the bioinformatics and statistics literature to develop the 'most informative spacing test' (MIST) for unsupervised detection of such transcriptomic features. In an example application involving 14 cases of pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, MIST more robustly identified features that perfectly discriminate subjects according to gender or the presence of a prognostically relevant fusion-gene than did seven other OASIS methods in the analysis of RNA-seq exon expression, RNA-seq exon junction expression and micorarray exon expression data. MIST was also effective at identifying features related to gender or molecular subtype in an example application involving 157 adult cases of acute myeloid leukemia.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CXCR4 expression has been correlated with leukocytosis and prognosis. Methods. We quantified CXCR4 expression by flow cytometry on leukemic cells in 142 AML patients. Results. We confirm a correlation between high CXCR4 expression and leukemic burden. Furthermore, we documented a correlation with platelet count, dysplastic megakaryopoiesis, hepato-splenomegaly and extra-hematological disease. NPM1-mutated AML displayed a significantly higher intensity of CXCR4 compared to NPM1-wt cases: it is conceivable its clinical phenotype to be driven by high CXCR4 expression. Conclusions. CXCR4 expression resulted an independent prognostic factor. Our data support CXCR4 targeting as a potential therapeutic strategy.

We have previously reported the impact of comorbidities on the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score. The aim of this study was to determine whether comorbidities continued to have a significant impact when patients were reclassified according to the Revised-IPSS (IPSS-R). The medical records of 600 consecutive myelodysplastic syndrome patients who presented to MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2002 and June 2004 were reviewed. The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) was used to assess the severity of comorbid conditions. Four hundred and two (67%) patients were male. Median age at presentation was 66.6 years (17-94). Mean duration of follow-up was 54 months (1-100). Five hundred and two (84%) patients died, and 54 (9%) patients underwent stem cell transplantation. Overall median survival was 16.8 months (1-100). Median survival by IPSS-R was 47, 34, 21, 16, and 6 months for patients in very low, low, intermediate, high, and very high-risk groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The ACE-27 comorbidity score significantly impacted the median survival of patients in the intermediate (P < 0.001), high (P = 0.045), and very high (P = 0.004) IPSS-R groups; but did not significantly impact the median survival in the low (P = 0.11) and very low (P = 0.49) IPSS-R groups. The ACE-27 comorbidity score significantly impacted the median survival of patients </=65 years (P < 0.001) but did not significantly impact those >65 years (P = 0.18).

Here, for the first time, we investigated the putative impact of UGT1A1*28 on CLL incidence and on the formation of the most common chromosomal abnormalities of CLL. UGT1A1*28 was investigated in 109 CLL patients and 108 healthy controls, and was associated with karyotypic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. A significant high frequency of the mutant genotype was observed in patients carrying abnormal FISH patterns, especially del(11q) and +12, which are CLL-specific abnormalities. We also observed a significant association between UGT1A1*28 and the intermediate to unfavorable cytogenetic CLL risk groups. No difference, though, was observed in genotypes between patients and controls. Therefore, we could suggest that UGT-deficient individuals may be at a greater risk for developing CLL-specific abnormalities. Our study might serve as a starting point to consider UGT1A1*28 polymorphism as one of the possible predisposing factors of CLL pathogenesis.","['Karakosta, Maria', 'Kalotychou, Vassiliki', 'Kostakis, Alkiviadis', 'Pantelias, Gabriel', 'Rombos, Ioannis', 'Kouraklis, Gregory', 'Manola, Kalliopi N']","['Karakosta M', 'Kalotychou V', 'Kostakis A', 'Pantelias G', 'Rombos I', 'Kouraklis G', 'Manola KN']","[""Laboratory of Cytogenetics, National Center for Scientific Research (NCSR) 'Demokritos', Athens, Greece.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140123,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['EC 2.4.1.- (UGT1A1 enzyme)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dinucleotide Repeats', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['000355714 [pii]', '10.1159/000355714 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2014;132(1):59-67. doi: 10.1159/000355714.

METHODS: Bendamustine was administered both as monotherapy and in combined protocols to 92 patients, including 76 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 16 patients with indolent lymphomas. Bendamustine plus rituximab was used to treat 65.2% of the patients, and 34.8% of the patients received bendamustine as monotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 64.2%, including the complete response rate (18.5%) and the partial response rate (45.7%). The median overall survival (OS) was 11.5 months. Among the pretreatment parameters, beta(2)-microglobulin (RR = 1.413; p = 0.001) and hemoglobin levels (RR = 0.85; p = 0.03) significantly influenced survival. The OS was significantly longer in patients who received </=2 lines of previous therapy compared to >3 lines (p = 0.043; log-rank test) and those who received >/=4 courses of therapy with bendamustine (p = 0.0007; log-rank test). Toxicity was predominantly hematological, including grade III/IV neutropenia in 33.7%, thrombocytopenia in 13%, and anemia in 13% of patients. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine, both in monotherapy and in combination regimens, is an effective therapy with a favorable toxicity profile in patients with indolent B-cell malignancies.","['Hus, Iwona', 'Jawniak, Dariusz', 'Gorska-Kosicka, Magdalena', 'Butrym, Aleksandra', 'Dzietczenia, Justyna', 'Wrobel, Tomasz', 'Grzegorz, Mazur', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Jedrzejczak, W Wiktor', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Poplawska, Lidia', 'Walewski, Jan', 'Dmoszynska, Anna']","['Hus I', 'Jawniak D', 'Gorska-Kosicka M', 'Butrym A', 'Dzietczenia J', 'Wrobel T', 'Grzegorz M', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Warzocha K', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Jedrzejczak WW', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Poplawska L', 'Walewski J', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140121,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2013/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['000357468 [pii]', '10.1159/000357468 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2013;59(4):280-9. doi: 10.1159/000357468.

Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) can induce astrocyte proliferation by increasing hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we studied whether LIF affects the proliferation of cultured primary rat astrocytes under OGD conditions by measuring EdU incorporation into astrocyte DNA and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNA and protein. Our findings show that low concentrations of LIF (5 and 10 ng/mL) significantly decreased EdU incorporation and downregulated the expression of PCNA mRNA and PCNA protein in astrocytes subjected to OGD. A low concentration of LIF (10 ng/mL) clearly inhibited astrocyte proliferation induced by OGD, while a higher concentration (50 ng/mL) had no effect. To investigate the mechanism of this inhibition by LIF (10 ng/mL), the expression of 3 related genes (LIF receptor, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF) was assessed using real-time PCR; VEGF protein expression was measured by Western blot. Our results indicate that LIFR mRNA was downregulated in astrocytes subjected to OGD. Interestingly, treatment with LIF further reduced LIFR mRNA expression in these cells. LIF treatment also decreased the expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA, VEGF mRNA, and VEGF protein induced by OGD. Low concentrations of LIF were observed to inhibit astrocyte proliferation induced by OGD.","['Fan, Yu-Ying', 'Zhang, Jun-Mei', 'Wang, Hua', 'Liu, Xue-Yan', 'Yang, Feng-Hua']","['Fan YY', 'Zhang JM', 'Wang H', 'Liu XY', 'Yang FH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, wangh1@sj-hospital.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars),Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis,1246675,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['7341 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars). 2013;73(4):485-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (decitabine and zeburaline) induced MPO gene promoter demethylation and MPO gene transcription in AML cells with low MPO activity. Therefore, MPO gene transcription was directly and indirectly regulated by DNA methylation. A DNA methylation microarray subsequently revealed a distinct methylation pattern in 33 genes, including DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B), in CD34-positive cells obtained from AML patients with a high percentage of MPO-positive blasts. Based on the inverse relationship between the methylation status of DNMT3B and MPO, we found an inverse relationship between DNMT3B and MPO transcription levels in CD34-positive AML cells (P=0.0283). In addition, a distinct methylation pattern was observed in five genes related to myeloid differentiation or therapeutic sensitivity in CD34-positive cells from AML patients with a high percentage of MPO-positive blasts. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that MPO may serve as an informative marker for identifying a distinct and crucial DNA methylation profile in CD34-positive AML cells.","['Itonaga, H', 'Imanishi, D', 'Wong, Y-F', 'Sato, S', 'Ando, K', 'Sawayama, Y', 'Sasaki, D', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Imaizumi, Y', 'Taguchi, J', 'Tsushima, H', 'Yoshida, S', 'Fukushima, T', 'Hata, T', 'Moriuchi, Y', 'Yanagihara, K', 'Miyazaki, Y']","['Itonaga H', 'Imanishi D', 'Wong YF', 'Sato S', 'Ando K', 'Sawayama Y', 'Sasaki D', 'Tsuruda K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Taguchi J', 'Tsushima H', 'Yoshida S', 'Fukushima T', 'Hata T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Yanagihara K', 'Miyazaki Y']","['1] Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan [2] Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, RIKEN Center for Development Biology, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Ohmura, Japan.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Peroxidase/*genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201415 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.15 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1459-66. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.15.

JNK activation was immunohistochemically assessed in 60 cases of HL and in a control group of 151 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The biologic effects of JNK activation in cultured HRS cells were investigated using colony formation, cell growth and viability assays and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to assess protein levels. p-JNK was expressed in 90% of HL, 83% of Burkitt lymphomas, 28% of mantle cell lymphomas, 23% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 19% of follicular lymphomas, and 18% of extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of MALT type. None of the 48 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and 18 cases of plasma cell myeloma showed JNK phosphorylation (P < 001, Kruskall-Wallis test). Pharmacological inhibition of JNK activity in cultured HRS cells resulted in a significant decrease of cell growth, which was associated with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The cell cycle effects were linked to deactivation of c-JUN and upregulation of its known target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. JNK is highly activated in HRS cells, and may contribute to uncontrolled cell cycle progression and proliferation of tumor cells in cHL.","['Leventaki, Vasiliki', 'Drakos, Elias', 'Karanikou, Maria', 'Psatha, Konstantina', 'Lin, Pei', 'Schlette, Ellen', 'Eliopoulos, Aris', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Papadaki, Helen', 'Patsouris, Efstratios', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Rassidakis, George Z']","['Leventaki V', 'Drakos E', 'Karanikou M', 'Psatha K', 'Lin P', 'Schlette E', 'Eliopoulos A', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Papadaki H', 'Patsouris E', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Rassidakis GZ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA; First Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Crete, Heraklion Crete 71003, Greece.', 'First Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece.', 'First Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical School, University of Crete, Heraklion Crete 71003, Greece.', 'First Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA; First Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece.

A number of studies assessed the association between RAD51 135G/C polymorphism and the risk of these cancers in different population. However, the results have been inconclusive. We performed a systematic meta-analysis to evaluate the association between RAD51 135G/C polymorphism and the risk of these four types of cancer. METHODS: Pubmed, Cochrane library and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched for case-control studies on RAD51 135G/C polymorphism and the risk of SCCHN, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and acute leukaemia published up to Oct 31, 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. RESULTS: A total of twenty-two published studies, with 6836 cases and 8507 controls were included. Overall, no significant association was found between RAD51 135G/C polymorphism and the risk of the four types of cancers (G/G vs. C/C: OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.43-1.59, P = 0.57). However, there was a significant association between this polymorphism and SCCHN risk in the subgroup analysis by cancer type (G/G vs. C/C: OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.08-5.61, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The RAD51 135G/C polymorphism was associated with the risk of SCCHN.

Up to one-third of patients who initiate first-line TKI therapy with imatinib, however, experience resistance to treatment, presenting as a lack or loss of response or as disease progression. Sokal or Hasford risk score at baseline and achievement of early molecular response to treatment may help identify patients at risk for resistance to first-line TKI therapy and poor prognosis. Approximately half of the patients with resistance to TKI treatment have mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain. Mutation status can be informative and should be considered alongside other factors, including patient history and drug safety profile, in second-line treatment choice. Factors present at the time of initiation of second-line TKI therapy, such as response to initial therapy, as well as achievement of molecular response within the first 6 months of second-line TKI therapy, have value in predicting response and survival outcomes. Given the expanding number of therapeutic options currently approved (FDA), an understanding of the clinical data supporting each of the options for second-line treatment would enable clinicians to develop treatment plans based on the best evidence-based information. This review estimates the incidence rate of TKI resistance that might be expected in the first-line setting, outlines practical approaches to determine TKI resistance, and discusses the factors that clinicians should consider when making a second-line treatment choice.","['Lau, Anna', 'Seiter, Karen']","['Lau A', 'Seiter K']","['Percolation Communications LLC, Bloomsbury, NJ.', 'New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.

Although high response rates are observed in CML patients who receive IM treatment, a significant number of patients develop resistance to IM. Resistance to IM in patients has been associated with a heterogeneous array of mechanisms of which point mutations within the ABL tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are the frequently documented. The types and frequencies of mutations reported in different population studies have shown wide variability. We screened 125 Malaysian CML patients on IM therapy who showed either TKI refractory or resistance to IM to investigate the frequency and pattern of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations among Malaysian CML patients undergoing IM therapy and to determine the clinical significance. Mutational screening using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) followed by DNA sequencing was performed on 125 IM resistant Malaysian CML patients. Mutations were detected in 28 patients (22.4%). Fifteen different types of mutations (T315I, E255K, G250E, M351T, F359C, G251E, Y253H, V289F, E355G, N368S, L387M, H369R, A397P, E355A, D276G), including 2 novel mutations were identified, with T315I as the predominant type of mutation. The data generated from clinical and molecular parameters studied were correlated with the survival of CML patients. Patients with Y253H, M351T and E355G TKD mutations showed poorer prognosis compared to those without mutation. Interestingly, when the prognostic impact of the observed mutations was compared inter-individually, E355G and Y253H mutations were associated with more adverse prognosis and shorter survival (P=0.025 and 0.005 respectively) than T315I mutation. Results suggest that apart from those mutations occurring in the three crucial regions (catalytic domain, P-loop and activation-loop), other rare mutations also may have high impact in the development of resistance and adverse prognosis. Presence of mutations in different regions of BCR-ABL TKD leads to different levels of resistance and early detection of emerging mutant clones may help in decision making for alternative treatment. Serial monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in CML patients allows appropriate selection of CML patients for BCR-ABL1 KD mutation analysis associated with acquired TKI resistance. Identification of these KD mutations is essential in order to direct alternative treatments in such CML patients.","['Elias, Marjanu Hikmah', 'Baba, Abdul Aziz', 'Azlan, Husin', 'Rosline, Hassan', 'Sim, Goh Ai', 'Padmini, Menon', 'Fadilah, S Abdul Wahid', 'Ankathil, Ravindran']","['Elias MH', 'Baba AA', 'Azlan H', 'Rosline H', 'Sim GA', 'Padmini M', 'Fadilah SA', 'Ankathil R']","['Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia.', 'Haemato-Oncology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia.', 'Haemato-Oncology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia.', 'Hematology Department, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun, Malaysia.', 'Medicine Department & Cell Therapy Centre, UKM Medical Centre, Malaysia.', 'Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia.

The aims of this study were to compare the risk of disability pension (DP) among patients diagnosed with eight subtypes of haematological malignancies to a reference cohort, and to determine if relative risks differ between these subtypes; to evaluate the influence of socioeconomic factors, demographic factors, and clinical factors on the risk of DP; and to investigate if these associations differ between the reference cohort and the patient cohort. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We combined data from national registers on Danish patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies between 2000 and 2007 and a reference cohort without a history of these diseases. A total of 3194 patients and 28 627 reference individuals were followed until DP, emigration, old age pension or anticipatory pension, death or 26 February 2012, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 550 (17%) patients and 1511 (5%) reference individuals were granted DP. Age- and gender-adjusted relative risks differed significantly between the subgroups of haematological malignancies and ranged from 2.64 (95% CI 1.84-3.78) for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma to 12.53 (95% CI 10.57-14.85) for patients with multiple myeloma. In the patient cohort we found that gender, age, comorbidity, ethnicity, educational level, household income, history of long-term sick leave, and need of treatment with anxiolytics or antidepressants after diagnosis were associated with receiving DP. However, most of these associations were stronger in the reference cohort. CONCLUSION: All eight subtypes of haematological malignancies were associated with an increased risk of DP compared to the reference cohort. The relative risks differed according to subtype, and patients with multiple myeloma had the highest risk of DP. Furthermore, most socioeconomic, demographic and clinical factors had a stronger impact on the risk of DP in the reference cohort than in the patient cohort.","['Horsboel, Trine A', 'Nielsen, Claus V', 'Andersen, Niels T', 'Nielsen, Bendt', 'de Thurah, Annette']","['Horsboel TA', 'Nielsen CV', 'Andersen NT', 'Nielsen B', 'de Thurah A']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital , Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140123,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Anti-Anxiety Agents)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anxiety/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Depression/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Disability Evaluation', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Pensions/*statistics & numerical data', '*Registries', 'Retirement/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Sick Leave/*statistics & numerical data', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2013.875625 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2014 Jun;53(6):724-34. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2013.875625.

We developed an animal model to determine the endometrial receptivity in rats with OHSS. Endometrial mRNA levels of ER, PR, HOXA10 and LIF were determined by semi-quantitative PCR and ER, PR, HOXA10, LIF and integrin alpha(v) beta(3) protein levels were determined by Western blotting. Development of pinopodes in the hyperstimulation group was slightly delayed, while in the regular stimulation group, development was significantly inhibited. mRNA transcription in the regular stimulation group was lower, while transcription in the hyperstimulation group was not different from controls. Protein expressions were lowest in the regular stimulation. We conclude that OHSS is associated with favourable endometrial receptivity, similar to that seen in a normal cycle, and receptivity that is increased relative to that seen with a routine stimulation protocol.","['Xu, C-K', 'Tang, S-B']","['Xu CK', 'Tang SB']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Obstet Gynaecol,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,8309140,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Integrin alphaVbeta3)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*physiology', 'Female', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01443615.2013.832735 [doi]'],ppublish,J Obstet Gynaecol. 2014 Feb;34(2):146-52. doi: 10.3109/01443615.2013.832735.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to 25% of patients with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, particularly to glucocorticoids (GCs), a class of drug to which resistance is one of the strongest indicators of poor clinical outcome. Despite their clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms that underpin GC resistance and leukaemia relapse are not well understood. Recently, we demonstrated that GC-resistance is associated with a proliferative metabolism involving the up-regulation of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Here we confirm that resistance is directly associated with a glycolytic phenotype and show that GC-resistant T-ALL cells are able to shift between glucose bioenergetic pathways. We evaluated the potential for targeting these pathways in vitro using a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), and the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor oligomycin in combination with methylprednisolone (MPRED). We found that oligomycin synergized with MPRED to sensitize cells otherwise resistant to GCs. Similarly we observed synergy between MPRED and simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol metabolism. Collectively, our findings suggest that dual targeting of bioenergetic pathways in combination with GCs may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in ALL.","['Samuels, Amy L', 'Heng, Jasmin Y', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Samuels AL', 'Heng JY', 'Beesley AH', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140123,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligomycins)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Galactose/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2014/01/25 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2014/01/25 06:00'],"['2013/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12727 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Apr;165(1):57-66. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12727.

The collection of larger cell doses of granulocyte concentrates (GCs) has been facilitated by the stimulation of donors with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and dexamethasone. The synergistic effect of G-CSF and dexamethasone has allowed the collection of larger cell doses of GCs and its use has increased steadily. This has allowed us to split the high-yield GC products and facilitated distribution of the split GC products to a second or third patient who needs GCs but lacks donors. The main objective of this article was to present our rationale for splitting GC products and how the split GC units were transfused to multiple patients.

These advances in CLL have come a long way in the past three decades since the development of Rai and Binet clinical staging systems. Important strides in the pathobiology, from defining mutational status of IGHV, to B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways and CLL microenvironment have made a major difference in our understanding of this disease. Mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGHV), CD38 and Zap-70, chromosomal aberrations and newer mutations, are the most clinically relevant prognostic markers. Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has become the treatment of choice for young and fit CLL patients. Various inhibitors of BCR signaling pathways and immunomodulatory drugs have shown efficacy in clinical trials. The most recent advance is the use of chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR) based on autologous T-lymphocytes. Nevertheless, CLL remains an incurable disease today.

It prevents a BCR-ABL protein from exerting its role in the oncogenic pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib directly inhibits the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib binds to BCR-ABL kinase domain by preventing the transfer of a phosphate group to tyrosine on the protein substrate and the subsequent activation of phosphorylated protein. As the result, the transmission of proliferative signals to the nucleus is blocked and leukemic cell apoptosis is induced. The FDA has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML in December 2002 following an International Randomized Study (IRIS), initiated in June 2000, comparing imatinib at a single daily dose 400 mg to IFN alpha plus cytarabine in newly diagnosed patients with CML in CP. Results from this study show the outstanding effectiveness of imatinib and its superiority with respect to the rates of complete hematological response (CHR), major and complete cytogenetic response (MCyR, CCyR). Patients randomized to imatinib arm at 8 - year data cut off continue to have a durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses, low progression rates to AP or BC, and remarkable survival outcomes. An overall survival (OS) rate is 85% for patients receiving imatinib (93% when only CML-related deaths and those prior to stem cell transplantation are considered). The results have been confirmed in the last years by several groups. According these cumulative results the rates of CCyR achieved after one year of therapy with imatinib at standard dose ranged from 49% to 77%, and the proportion of patients who achieved major molecular response (MMR) after one year ranged between 18% and 58%. Discontinuation of imatinib has been also tried in patients in MMR, a molecular relapse occurs in about one third of patients, generally within 6 months from imatinib cessation.","['Sacha, Tomasz']",['Sacha T'],"['Department of Hematology, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140102,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC3894842,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/01/24 06:01,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2014.007 [doi]', 'mjhid-6-1-e2014007 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2014 Jan 2;6(1):e2014007. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2014.007. eCollection 2014 Jan 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This therapy improved the quality of life during the chronic phase of the disease, without preventing nor significantly delaying the progression towards advanced phases. The introduction of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) marked the first important breakthrough in the evolution of CML treatment, because about 50% of the eligible patients were cured. The second breakthrough was the introduction of human recombinant interferon-alfa, able to achieve a complete cytogenetic remission in 15% to 30% of patients, with a significant survival advantage over conventional chemotherapy. At the end of the last century, about 15 years ago, all these treatments were quickly replaced by a class of small molecules targeting the tyrosine kinases (TK), which were able to induce a major molecular remission in most of the patients, without remarkable side effects, and a very prolonged life-span. The first approved TK inhibitor (TKI) was Imatinib Mesylate (Glivec or Gleevec, Novartis). Rapidly, other TKIs were developed tested and commercialized, namely Dasatinib (Sprycel, Bristol-Myers Squibb), Nilotinib (Tasigna, Novartis), Bosutinib (Busulif, Pfizer) and Ponatinib (Iclusig, Ariad). Not all these compounds are available worldwide; some of them are approved only for second line treatment, and the high prices are a problem that can limit their use. A frequent update of treatment recommendations is necessary. The current treatment goals include not only the prevention of the transformation to the advanced phases and the prolongation of survival, but also a length of survival and of a quality of life comparable to that of non-leukemic individuals. In some patient the next ambitious step is to move towards a treatment-free remission. The CML therapy, the role of alloSCT and the promising experimental strategies are reviewed in the context of the new therapeutic goals.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Palandri, Francesca', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Baccarani M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Palandri F', 'Rosti G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology ""L. and A.

AIMS: To compare bone marrow aspirate with trephine biopsy in hematological disorders. To determine the optimum trephine preprocessing length in lymphoma infiltration. METHODS: Diagnostic comparison was done between simultaneous bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies in 449 patients. Biopsies were fixed in formalin, decalcified in 5.5% EDTA and routinely processed. Concordance rates and validity parameters for aspirate were calculated. Three deeper sections of trephine biopsy, cut at 0.1-0.2 mm intervals, were assessed for lymphoma involvement. Proportion of biopsies showing marrow infiltration by lymphoma cells was plotted against trephine length and correlation was assessed. RESULTS: Aspirate had a high sensitivity for acute leukemia (89.4%) and multiple myeloma (88.5%), moderate for NHL (67.6%) and nonhematopoietic metastases (58.3%) and low for aplastic anemia (38.5%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (5%). Aspirate has no role in granulomatous myelitis and myelofibrosis. Lymphoma positivity increased with trephine length, with maximum positivity (68.9%) seen in 17-20 mm group and no further gain beyond 20 mm. (lymphoma positivity </=16mm=40.3% and >/=17mm=66.1%, p=0.0011). CONCLUSION: Aspirate has a high specificity; its sensitivity depends upon the type of disease. Apart from few conditions, in which aspirate alone is sufficient, biopsy is mandatory in most. Preprocessing trephine length of 17-20 mm examined at multiple deeper levels was found optimal for assessing lymphoma positivity.","['Goyal, Surbhi', 'Singh, Usha Rani', 'Rusia, Usha']","['Goyal S', 'Singh UR', 'Rusia U']","['Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140102,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC3894839,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/01/24 06:01,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2014.002 [doi]', 'mjhid-6-1-e2014002 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2014 Jan 2;6(1):e2014002. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2014.002. eCollection 2014 Jan 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Challenging differential diagnosis. BACKGROUND: L-asparaginase (L-aspa) is an important component of chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Main adverse effects of L-aspa include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, thrombosis, and liver disturbances. L-aspa-associated steatohepatitis may be a life-threatening disorder but has very rarely been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: ALL was diagnosed in a 52-year-old man with a history of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Chemotherapy combining daunorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and L-aspa was initiated. At the time of neutrophil recovery, the patient developed hepatomegaly in the context of fever and cough. On day 25, after 6 injections of L-aspa, liver function tests showed elevated alkaline phosphatase and transaminases levels. Although pulmonary Pneumocystis was concomitantly diagnosed, biological hepatic disturbances were attributed to L-aspa-associated toxicity. A liver biopsy revealed severe diffuse micro- and macrovesicular steatosis affecting more than 50% of hepatocytes. Other causes of liver dysfunction were eliminated. L-aspa and other hepatotoxic treatments were stopped, and treatment with antioxidant therapy, atovaquone, and corticosteroids was initiated. The clinical outcome was rapidly favorable. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the necessity of carefully monitoring liver function test results in patients receiving L-aspa. In case of major increase of hepatic enzymes, a hepatic biopsy should rapidly be performed to exclude differential diagnosis in patients with prolonged neutropenia. L-aspa should be stopped and further administration definitively avoided. In the present case, the early administration of systemic corticosteroids as treatment of the concomitant Pneumocystis with hypoxemia could have participated to the favorable clinical evolution.","['Saison, Julien', 'Berger, Francoise', 'Lebosse, Fanny', 'Audoual, Regis', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Michallet, Mauricette']","['Saison J', 'Berger F', 'Lebosse F', 'Audoual R', 'Thomas X', 'Michallet M']","['Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre Benite, France ; Lyon-1 University, Lyon, France ; CIRI (Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie), Inserm U1111, CNRS UMR5308, ENS de Lyon, UCBL1, Lyon, France.', 'Lyon-1 University, Lyon, France ; Department of Pathology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Lyon-1 University, Lyon, France ; Hepatogastroenterology Unit, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Croix Rousse Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Lyon-1 University, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre Benite, France ; Lyon-1 University, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre Benite, France ; Lyon-1 University, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140112,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,,,PMC3894917,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/01/24 06:01,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12659/AJCR.889867 [doi]', '889867 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2014 Jan 12;15:13-7. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.889867. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cholestasis', 'hepatomegaly', 'steatosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the clinical associations of HTLV-1 infection among socially disadvantaged Indigenous adults in central Australia. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HTLV-1 serological results for Indigenous adults admitted 1(st) January 2000 to 31(st) December 2010 were obtained from the Alice Springs Hospital pathology database. Infections, comorbid conditions and HTLV-1 related diseases were identified using ICD-10 AM discharge morbidity codes. Relevant pathology and imaging results were reviewed. Disease associations, admission rates and risk factors for death were compared according to HTLV-1 serostatus. HTLV-1 western blots were positive for 531 (33.3%) of 1595 Indigenous adults tested. Clinical associations of HTLV-1 infection included bronchiectasis (adjusted Risk Ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.14-1.60), blood stream infections (BSI) with enteric organisms (aRR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.77) and admission with strongyloidiasis (aRR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.64). After adjusting for covariates, HTLV-1 infection remained associated with increased numbers of BSI episodes (adjusted negative binomial regression, coefficient, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41) and increased admission numbers with strongyloidiasis (coefficient, 0.563; 95% CI, 0.17-0.95) and respiratory conditions including asthma (coefficient, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.27-1.7), lower respiratory tract infections (coefficient, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.34) and bronchiectasis (coefficient, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.02-1.18). Two patients were admitted with adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma, four with probable HTLV-1 associated myelopathy and another with infective dermatitis. Independent predictors of mortality included BSI with enteric organisms (aRR 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.74) and bronchiectasis (aRR 2.07; 95% CI, 1.45-2.98). CONCLUSION: HTLV-1 infection contributes to morbidity among socially disadvantaged Indigenous adults in central Australia. This is largely due to an increased risk of other infections and respiratory disease. The spectrum of HTLV-1 related diseases may vary according to the social circumstances of the affected population.","['Einsiedel, Lloyd', 'Spelman, Tim', 'Goeman, Emma', 'Cassar, Olivier', 'Arundell, Mick', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Einsiedel L', 'Spelman T', 'Goeman E', 'Cassar O', 'Arundell M', 'Gessain A']","['Flinders University/Northern Territory Rural Clinical School, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia ; SAPathology, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Flinders University/Northern Territory Rural Clinical School, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia.', 'Remote Health, Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Paris, France ; CNRS, UMR 3569, Paris, France."", 'Clinical Information Analyst, Central Australian Health Network, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Paris, France ; CNRS, UMR 3569, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adult', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population Groups', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3894183,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0002643 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-13-01234 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2014 Jan 16;8(1):e2643. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002643. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to investigate whether the routinely administered ALL chemotherapeutic agents would be able to bind and inhibit the key deregulated cell cycle proteins such as--Cyclins E1, D1, D3, A1 and Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK) 2 and 6. We used Schrodinger Glide docking protocol to dock the chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin and Daunorubicin and others which are not very common including Clofarabine, Nelarabine and Flavopiridol, to the crystal structures of these proteins. We observed that the drugs were able to bind and interact with cyclins E1 and A1 and CDKs 2 and 6 while their docking to cyclins D1 and D3 were not successful. This binding proved favorable to interact with the G1/S cell cycle phase proteins that were examined in this study and may lead to the interruption of the growth of leukemic cells. Our observations therefore suggest that these drugs could be explored for use as inhibitors for these cell cycle proteins. Further, we have also highlighted residues which could be important in the designing of pharmacophores against these cell cycle proteins.

We have previously shown that the recombinant enzyme thiaminase cleaves and depletes intracellular thiamine, has growth inhibitory activity against leukemia and breast cancer cell lines, and that its growth inhibitory effects were reversed in leukemia cell lines by rapamycin. Now, we first show further evidence of thiaminase therapeutic potential by demonstrating its activity against breast and leukemia xenografts, and against a primary leukemia xenograft. We therefore further explored the metabolic effects of thiaminase in combination with rapamycin in leukemia and breast cell lines. Thiaminase decreased oxygen consumption rate and increased extracellular acidification rate, consistent with the inhibitory effect of acute thiamine depletion on the activity of the TDEs pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes; these effects were reversed by rapamycin. Metabolomic studies demonstrated intracellular thiamine depletion and the presence of the thiazole cleavage product in thiaminase-treated cells, providing validation of the experimental procedures. Accumulation of ribose and ribulose in both cell lines support the thiaminase-mediated suppression of the TDE transketolase. Interestingly, thiaminase suppression of another TDE, branched chain amino ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), showed very different patterns in the two cell lines: in RS4 leukemia cells it led to an increase in BCKDH substrates, and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells it led to a decrease in BCKDH products. Immunoblot analyses showed corresponding differences in expression of BCKDH pathway enzymes, and partial protection of thiaminase growth inhibition by gabapentin indicated that BCKDH inhibition may be a mechanism of thiaminase-mediated toxicity. Surprisingly, most of thiaminase-mediated metabolomic effects were also reversed by rapamycin. Thus, these studies demonstrate that acute intracellular thiamine depletion by recombinant thiaminase results in metabolic changes in thiamine-dependent metabolism, and demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of mTOR signaling in the regulation of thiamine-dependent metabolism.","['Liu, Shuqian', 'Miriyala, Sumitra', 'Keaton, Mignon A', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Wiedl, Christina', 'Clair, Daret K St', 'Moscow, Jeffrey A']","['Liu S', 'Miriyala S', 'Keaton MA', 'Jordan CT', 'Wiedl C', 'Clair DK', 'Moscow JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', 'Graduate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', 'Metabolon, Inc, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, United States of America.', 'Graduate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140115,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Amino Acids, Aromatic)', '0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.99.2 (thiaminase II)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids, Aromatic/metabolism', 'Amino Acids, Branched-Chain/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Thiamine/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3893258,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085702 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-41069 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 15;9(1):e85702. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085702. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemia, the ablation of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is necessary to permanently eradicate the leukemia cell population. However, because of the very small number of LSCs in leukemia cell populations, their use in xenotransplantation studies (in vivo) and the difficulties in functionally and pathophysiologically replicating clinical conditions in cell culture experiments (in vitro), the progress of drug discovery for LSC inhibitors has been painfully slow. In this study, we developed a novel phenotype-based in vivo screening method using LSCs xenotransplanted into zebrafish. Aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) cells were purified from chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells tagged with a fluorescent protein (Kusabira-orange) and then implanted in young zebrafish at 48 hours post-fertilization. Twenty-four hours after transplantation, the animals were treated with one of eight different therapeutic agents (imatinib, dasatinib, parthenolide, TDZD-8, arsenic trioxide, niclosamide, salinomycin, and thioridazine). Cancer cell proliferation, and cell migration were determined by high-content imaging. Of the eight compounds that were tested, all except imatinib and dasatinib selectively inhibited ALDH+ cell proliferation in zebrafish. In addition, these anti-LSC agents suppressed tumor cell migration in LSC-xenotransplants. Our approach offers a simple, rapid, and reliable in vivo screening system that facilitates the phenotype-driven discovery of drugs effective in suppressing LSCs.","['Zhang, Beibei', 'Shimada, Yasuhito', 'Kuroyanagi, Junya', 'Umemoto, Noriko', 'Nishimura, Yuhei', 'Tanaka, Toshio']","['Zhang B', 'Shimada Y', 'Kuroyanagi J', 'Umemoto N', 'Nishimura Y', 'Tanaka T']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Mie University Medical Zebrafish Research Center, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Bioinformatics, Mie University Life Science Research Center, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Omics Medicine, Mie University Industrial Technology Innovation, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Mie University Medical Zebrafish Research Center, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Bioinformatics, Mie University Life Science Research Center, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Omics Medicine, Mie University Industrial Technology Innovation, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Mie University Medical Zebrafish Research Center, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Bioinformatics, Mie University Life Science Research Center, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Omics Medicine, Mie University Industrial Technology Innovation, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan ; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Zebrafish']",PMC3893211,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085439 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-29601 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 15;9(1):e85439. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085439. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of E2A leads to leukemia and tumorigenesis of some solid tumors. The expression and clinical significance of E2A as well as its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unknown. This study aims to assess E2A expression in CRC tissues, evaluate its prognosis value, and investigate its role in colon cancer cell growth. METHODS: E2A expression in CRC tissues and normal mucosa was detected by immunohistochemical staining; Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the prognostic value of E2A. Lentivirus was used to construct E2A stably knocked-down cells. MTT assay was employed to detect cell proliferation change; cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry; and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to validate the predicted binding target of E2A. RESULTS: Expression of E2A was lower in CRC tissues than normal mucosa; low E2A expression correlated with advanced TNM stage and larger tumor size, and predicted poor prognosis of CRC patients. E2A knockdown resulted in increased cell proliferation rate and cell cycle acceleration. ChIP assay showed miR-320a was a direct target of E2A and upregulation of miR-320a in E2A downregulated cells could reverse cell proliferation and cell cycle changes caused by E2A deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: E2A is an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients and targets miR-320a to regulate cell proliferation of colon cancer cells.","['Huang, Ao', 'Zhao, Hongchao', 'Quan, Yingjun', 'Jin, Runsen', 'Feng, Bo', 'Zheng, Minhua']","['Huang A', 'Zhao H', 'Quan Y', 'Jin R', 'Feng B', 'Zheng M']","[""Department of Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Shanghai, China ; Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Shanghai, China ; Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Shanghai, China ; Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Shanghai, China ; Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Shanghai, China ; Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Shanghai, China ; Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN320 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Demography', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/pathology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",PMC3890311,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085201 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-36126 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 13;9(1):e85201. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085201. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHD5 is down-regulated in several cancers, including leukemia and is responsible for tumor generation and progression. However, the mechanism of CHD5 down-regulation in leukemia is largely unknown. In this study, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses revealed that CHD5 was down-regulated in human leukemia cell lines and samples. Luciferase reporter assays showed that most of the baseline regulatory activity was localized from 500 to 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Bisulfite DNA sequencing of the identified regulatory element revealed that the CHD5 promoter was hypermethylated in human leukemia cells and samples. Thus, CHD5 expression was inversely correlated with promoter DNA methylation in these samples. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) activates CHD5 expression in human leukemia cell lines. In vitro luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that methylation of the CHD5 promoter repressed its promoter activity. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay combined with qualitative PCR identified activating protein 2 (AP2) as a potential transcription factor involved in CHD5 expression and indicated that treatment with DAC increases the recruitment of AP2 to the CHD5 promoter. In vitro transcription-factor activity studies showed that AP2 over-expression was able to activate CHD5 promoter activity. Our findings indicate that repression of CHD5 gene expression in human leukemia is mediated in part by DNA methylation of its promoter.","['Zhao, Rui', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Wang, Nisha', 'Ma, Wenli', 'Yan, Qitao']","['Zhao R', 'Meng F', 'Wang N', 'Ma W', 'Yan Q']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (CHD5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-2/metabolism']",PMC3890315,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085172 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-27045 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 13;9(1):e85172. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085172. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present atudy was to investigate whether and how ST6GAL family involved in multidrug resistance (MDR) in human leukemia cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) of leukemia patients. Real-time PCR showed a high expression level of ST6GAL1 gene in both MDR cells and BMMCs (*P<0.05). Alternation of ST6GAL1 levels had a significant impact on drug-resistant phenotype changing of K562 and K562/ADR cells both in vitro and in vivo. However, no significant changes were observed of ST6GAL2 gene. Further data revealed that manipulation of ST6GAL1 modulated the activity of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and consequently regulated the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, *P<0.05) and multidrug resistance related protein 1 (MRP1, *P<0.05), which are both known to be associated with MDR. Therefore we postulate that ST6GAL1 is responsible for the development of MDR in human leukemia cells probably through medicating the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling and the expression of P-gp and MRP1.","['Ma, Hongye', 'Cheng, Lei', 'Hao, Keji', 'Li, Yanping', 'Song, Xiaobo', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Jia, Li']","['Ma H', 'Cheng L', 'Hao K', 'Li Y', 'Song X', 'Zhou H', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Laparoscopic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20140116,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (ST6GAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (St6Gal2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sialyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3894187,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085113 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-38596 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 16;9(1):e85113. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085113. eCollection 2014.,,['PLoS One. 2019 Oct 17;14(10):e0224304.

Silencing of tumor suppressor genes may be ascribed to promoter DNA hypermethylation, a reversible phenomenon intensely investigated as potential therapeutic target. Previously, we demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) exhibits a DNA demethylating action that promotes the re-expression of the tumor suppressor gene CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPdelta). The C/EBPbeta/C/EBPdelta heterodimer formed appears essential for the monocyte differentiation commitment. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of EPA on RAS/extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2)/C/EBPbeta pathway, known to be induced during the monocyte differentiation program. We found that EPA conditioning of U937 leukemia cells activated RAS/ERK/C/EBPbeta pathway, increasing the C/EBPbeta and ERK1/2 active phosphorylated forms. Transcriptional induction of the upstream activator H-Ras gene resulted in increased expression of H-Ras protein in the active pool of non raft membrane fraction. H-Ras gene analysis identified an hypermethylated CpG island in intron 1 that can affect the DNA-protein interaction modifying RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity. EPA treatment demethylated almost completely this CpG island, which was associated with an enrichment of active RNAPII. The increased binding of the H-Ras transcriptional regulator p53 to its consensus sequence within the intronic CpG island further confirmed the effect of EPA as demethylating agent. Our results provide the first evidence that an endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) promotes a DNA demethylation process responsible for the activation of RAS/ERK/C/EBPbeta pathway during the monocyte differentiation commitment. The new role of EPA as demethylating agent paves the way for studying PUFA action when aberrant DNA methylation is involved.","['Ceccarelli, Veronica', 'Nocentini, Giuseppe', 'Billi, Monia', 'Racanicchi, Serena', 'Riccardi, Carlo', 'Roberti, Rita', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'Binaglia, Luciano', 'Vecchini, Alba']","['Ceccarelli V', 'Nocentini G', 'Billi M', 'Racanicchi S', 'Riccardi C', 'Roberti R', 'Grignani F', 'Binaglia L', 'Vecchini A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/*metabolism', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/genetics', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3890293,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085025 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-40984 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 13;9(1):e85025. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085025. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although recent studies revealed that the therapeutic action of As4S4 is closely associated with the induction of cellular apoptosis, the exact molecular mechanism of action of As4S4 in RA-resistant APL remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that As4S4-induced apoptosis was accompanied by reduced mRNA and protein expression of SET gene in RA-resistant NB4-R1 cells. Moreover, RNAi knockdown of SET gene further promoted As4S4-induced apoptosis, while SET over-expression inhibited it, suggesting that As4S4 induces apoptosis through the reduction of SET protein in NB4-R1 cells. We also demonstrated that the knockdown of SET gene resulted in the upregulation of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) expression and the downregulation of promyelocytic leukemia and retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion gene (PML-RARalpha) expression, which were enhanced by As4S4 treatments. By contrast, over-expression of SET gene resulted in PP2A downregulation and PML-RARalpha upregulation, which were abolished by As4S4 pretreatment. Since PP2A is a pro-apoptotic factor and PMLRARalpha is an anti-apoptotic factor, our results suggest that As4S4-induced apoptosis in NB4-R1 cells is through the downregulation of SET protein expression, which in turn increases PP2A and reduces PML-RARalpha expressions to lead to cell apoptosis.","['Tian, Yuwang', 'Liu, Yanfeng', 'He, Pengcheng', 'Liu, Feng', 'Zhou, Naicen', 'Cheng, Xiaoyan', 'Shi, Lili', 'Zhu, Huachao', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Zhang, Mei']","['Tian Y', 'Liu Y', 'He P', 'Liu F', 'Zhou N', 'Cheng X', 'Shi L', 'Zhu H', 'Zhao J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang M']","['Department of Pathology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '44SIJ800OX (arsenic trisulfide)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3890287,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0083184 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-32656 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 13;9(1):e83184. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0083184. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014 Jun 20;9(6):e99923.

Reduced capacity for apoptosis induction by chemotherapies is one obstacle to efficient treatments. Human UM is characterized by high expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Consequently, regulators of apoptosis such as Bcl-2 family inhibitors may constitute an attractive approach to UM therapeutics. In this aim, we have investigated the efficacy of the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor S44563 on 4 UM Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) and derived-cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Four well characterized UM PDXs were used for in vivo experiments. S44563 was administered alone or combined with fotemustine either concomitantly or after the alkylating agent. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 expressions after S44563 administration were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: S44563 administered alone by at 50 and 100 mg/kg i.p. induced a significant tumour growth inhibition in only one xenograft model with a clear dose effect. However, when S44563 was concomitantly administered with fotemustine, we observed a synergistic activity in 3 out of the 4 tested models. In addition, S44563 administered after fotemustine induced a tumour growth delay in 2 out of 3 tested xenografts. Finally, IHC analyses showed that Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 expression were not modified after S44563 administration. CONCLUSION: The novel anti-apoptotic experimental compound S44563, despite a relative low efficacy when administered alone, increased the efficacy of fotemustine in either concomitant or sequential combinations or indeed subsequent to fotemustine. These data support further exploration of potential therapeutic effect of Bcl-2/Bcl-xl inhibition in human UM.","['Nemati, Fariba', 'de Montrion, Catherine', 'Lang, Guillaume', 'Kraus-Berthier, Laurence', 'Carita, Guillaume', 'Sastre-Garau, Xavier', 'Berniard, Aurelie', 'Vallerand, David', 'Geneste, Olivier', 'de Plater, Ludmilla', 'Pierre, Alain', 'Lockhart, Brian', 'Desjardins, Laurence', 'Piperno-Neumann, Sophie', 'Depil, Stephane', 'Decaudin, Didier']","['Nemati F', 'de Montrion C', 'Lang G', 'Kraus-Berthier L', 'Carita G', 'Sastre-Garau X', 'Berniard A', 'Vallerand D', 'Geneste O', 'de Plater L', 'Pierre A', 'Lockhart B', 'Desjardins L', 'Piperno-Neumann S', 'Depil S', 'Decaudin D']","['Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'I.D.R.S., Institut de Recherches Servier, Croissy, France.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'I.R.I.S., Institut de Recherches International Servier, Suresnes, France.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'I.R.I.S., Institut de Recherches International Servier, Suresnes, France.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'I.D.R.S., Institut de Recherches Servier, Croissy, France.', 'I.D.R.S., Institut de Recherches Servier, Croissy, France.', 'Department of Ophthalmological Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'I.D.R.S., Institut de Recherches Servier, Croissy, France ; I.R.I.S., Institut de Recherches International Servier, Suresnes, France.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Investigation, Department of Translational Research, Institut Curie, Paris, France ; Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (S44563)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'GQ7JL9P5I2 (fotemustine)', 'Uveal melanoma']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Uveal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3890263,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080836 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-37525 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 13;9(1):e80836. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080836. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood cells are divided into three lineages erythriod (erythrocytes), lymphoid (B and T cells), and myeloid (granulocytes, megakaryocytes, and macrophages). Haematopoiesis is a complex process regulated by several mechanisms including microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small RNAs which regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Evidence shows that miRNAs play an important role in haematopoiesis; for example, myeloid and erythroid differentiation is blocked by the overexpression of miR-15a. miR-221, miR-222, and miR-24 inhibit the erythropoiesis, whereas miR-150 plays a role in B and T cell differentiation. miR-146 and miR-10a are downregulated in megakaryopoiesis. Aberrant expression of miRNAs was observed in hematological malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myelomas, and B cell lymphomas.

In contrast, Vif-deficient HIV-1 (DeltaVif HIV-1) is profoundly restricted by mA3, and the restriction includes high levels of G-to-A mutation. Human APOBEC3G (hA3G), unlike mA3, is fully active against MLVs. We produced a glutathione S-transferase-mA3 fusion protein in insect cells and demonstrated that it possesses cytidine deaminase activity, as expected. This activity is localized within the N-terminal domain of this 2-domain protein; the C-terminal domain is enzymatically inactive but required for mA3 encapsidation into retrovirus particles. We found that a specific arginine residue and several aromatic residues, as well as the zinc-coordinating cysteines in the C-terminal domain, are necessary for mA3 packaging; a structural model of this domain suggests that these residues line a potential nucleic acid-binding interface. Mutation of a few potential phosphorylation sites in mA3 drastically reduces its antiviral activity by impairing either deaminase activity or its encapsidation. mA3 deaminates short single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides preferentially toward their 3' ends, whereas hA3G exhibits the opposite polarity. However, when packaged into infectious DeltaVif HIV-1 virions, both mA3 and hA3G preferentially induce deaminations toward the 5' end of minus-strand viral DNA, presumably because of the sequence of events during reverse transcription in vivo. Despite the fact that mA3 in MLV particles does not induce detectable deaminations upon infection, its deaminase activity is easily detected in virus lysates. We still do not understand how MLV resists mA3-induced G-to-A mutation. IMPORTANCE: One way that mammalian cells defend themselves against infection by retroviruses is with APOBEC3 proteins. These proteins convert cytidine bases to uridine bases in retroviral DNA. However, mouse APOBEC3 protein blocks infection by murine leukemia viruses without catalyzing this base change, and the mechanism of inhibition is not understood in this case. We have produced recombinant mouse APOBEC3 protein for the first time and characterized it here in a number of ways. Our mutational studies shed light on the mechanism by which mouse APOBEC3 protein is incorporated into retrovirus particles. While mouse APOBEC3 does not catalyze base changes in murine leukemia virus DNA, it can be recovered from these virus particles in enzymatically active form; it is still not clear why it fails to induce base changes when these viruses infect new cells.","['Nair, Smita', 'Sanchez-Martinez, Silvia', 'Ji, Xinhua', 'Rein, Alan']","['Nair S', 'Sanchez-Martinez S', 'Ji X', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20140122,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*immunology/physiology', 'Insecta', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",PMC3993542,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03456-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03456-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Apr;88(7):3850-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03456-13.

Although aHSCT provides a good response against the malignant cells (graft-versus-leukemia [GVL]), it also leads to the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a severe disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. Therapy for GVHD is commonly based on nonspecific immunosupression of the transplanted recipient, resulting in the concomitant inhibition of the GVL effect. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to specifically suppress GVHD while sparing the GVL, based on oral treatment of transplant donors with recipient Ags, associated with the intake of probiotic Lactococcus lactis as tolerogenic adjuvant (combined therapy). We show that treatment of C57BL/6 donor mice with combined therapy before the transplant protects the recipients F1 (C57BL/6 x BAL/c) mice from clinical and pathological manifestations of disease, resulting in 100% survival rate. Importantly, the animals keep the immunological competence maintaining the GVL response as well as the response to third-party Ags. The protection is specific, long lasting and dependent on donor IL-10-sufficient B cells activity, which induces regulatory T cells in the host. These data suggest that combined therapy is a promising strategy for prevention of GVHD with preservation of GVL, opening new possibilities to treat human patients subjected to transplantation.","['Mercadante, Ana C T', 'Perobelli, Suelen M', 'Alves, Ana P G', 'Goncalves-Silva, Triciana', 'Mello, Wallace', 'Gomes-Santos, Ana C', 'Miyoshi, Anderson', 'Azevedo, Vasco', 'Faria, Ana M C', 'Bonomo, Adriana']","['Mercadante AC', 'Perobelli SM', 'Alves AP', 'Goncalves-Silva T', 'Mello W', 'Gomes-Santos AC', 'Miyoshi A', 'Azevedo V', 'Faria AM', 'Bonomo A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Brazilian National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (IL10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Isoantigens/*therapeutic use', 'Lactococcus lactis/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Probiotics/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1301034 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1301034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Feb 15;192(4):1928-37. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1301034.

PROCEDURE: MBL2 polymorphisms for exon 1 and FCN2 polymorphisms for promoter regions -986, -602, -557, -64, -4 and exon 8 regions +6,359, +6,424 were determined in children with B-ALL. FCN2 haplotype was determined by gene sequencing. Number and duration of FN episodes as well as number of bacterial infections were recorded during induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Forty-four children with B-ALL (median age 4.3 years, 65.9% males) suffered from 142 FN episodes and 92 bacterial infections (40.2% Gram positive and 59.8% Gram negative). MBL2 low-risk genotype was found in 59.1%, medium-risk in 31.8% and high-risk in 9%. FCN2 low-risk haplotypes were detected in 38.2%, medium-risk in 44.1% and high-risk in 17.6%. MBL2 genotype and FCN2 haplotype were not associated with increased frequency of FN episodes. MBL2 medium/high-risk genotype and FCN2 medium/high-risk haplotype were associated with prolonged duration of FN (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001, respectively) and increased number of bacterial infections (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). The combined MBL2/FCN2 medium/high-risk genotype was associated with an increased number of bacterial infections (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MBL2 and FCN2 single or combined deficiencies are associated with increased duration of FN episodes as well as increased number of bacterial infections in children with B-ALL suggesting a prognostic role of these genes.","['Pana, Zoe Dorothea', 'Samarah, Fekri', 'Papi, Rigini', 'Antachopoulos, Charalampos', 'Papageorgiou, Theodotis', 'Farmaki, Evangelia', 'Hatzipantelis, Emmanuel', 'Tragiannidis, Athanassios', 'Vavatsi-Christaki, Norma', 'Kyriakidis, Dimitrios', 'Athanassiadou-Piperopoulou, Fani', 'Roilides, Emmanuel']","['Pana ZD', 'Samarah F', 'Papi R', 'Antachopoulos C', 'Papageorgiou T', 'Farmaki E', 'Hatzipantelis E', 'Tragiannidis A', 'Vavatsi-Christaki N', 'Kyriakidis D', 'Athanassiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Roilides E']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University School of Medicine, AHEPA General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece; Biochemistry Laboratory, Aristotle University School of Medicine, Thessaloniki, Greece; Biochemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University Faculty of Chemistry, Thessaloniki, Greece; Infectious Disease Unit, 3rd Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University School of Medicine, Hippokration General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (MBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)', '0 (ficolin)', 'Mannose-Binding Protein Deficiency']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Codon/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Lectins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/deficiency/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/complications/immunology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*genetics', 'Risk']",,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24951 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jun;61(6):1017-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24951.

The expansion, accumulation, and activation of Tregs in viral infections are of major interest in order to find ways to alter Treg functions for therapeutic benefit. Tregs are able to dampen effector T cell responses to viral infections and thereby contribute to the establishment of a chronic infection. In the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model, Tregs are known to expand in all infected organs. To better understand the characteristics of these Treg populations, their phenotype was analyzed in detail. During acute FV-infection, Tregs became activated in the spleen and bone marrow, as indicated by various T cell activation markers, such as CD43 and CD103. Interestingly, Tregs in the bone marrow, which contains the highest viral loads during acute infection, displayed greater levels of activation than Tregs from the spleen. Treg expansion was driven by proliferation but no FV-specific Tregs could be detected. Activated Tregs in FV-infection did not produce Granzyme B (GzmB) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), which are thought to be a potential mechanism for their suppressive activity. Furthermore, Tregs expressed inhibitory markers, such as TIM3, PD-1 and PD-L1. Blocking TIM3 and PD-L1 with antibodies during chronic FV-infection increased the numbers of activated Tregs. These data may have important implications for the understanding of Treg functions during chronic viral infections.","['Joedicke, Jara J', 'Dietze, Kirsten K', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Joedicke JJ', 'Dietze KK', 'Zelinskyy G', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140120,China,Virol Sin,Virologica Sinica,101514185,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Havcr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animal Structures/immunology/virology', 'Animals', 'B7-H1 Antigen/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Granzymes/analysis', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/analysis', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/chemistry/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",PMC8206416,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/18 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12250-014-3396-z [doi]'],ppublish,Virol Sin. 2014 Feb;29(1):48-60. doi: 10.1007/s12250-014-3396-z.

The subcutaneous route of administration is expected to improve convenience for patients and to reduce healthcare professional resource use compared with conventional intravenous infusion. Various non-clinical and clinical studies were conducted to support the bridge from the approved intravenous formulation to the novel subcutaneous treatment. The underlying hypothesis for these studies was that achieving subcutaneous rituximab serum trough concentrations that are at least as high as those reached with the intravenous formulation would result in at least the same degree of receptor saturation. Preclinical mouse xenograft and cynomolgus monkey B-cell depletion studies were performed at intravenous and subcutaneous doses that were previously found to result in comparable serum concentrations in pharmacokinetic studies in the same species. Results from these non-clinical assessments guided dose selection for the subsequent phase 1b dose finding trials in patients with follicular lymphoma as part of maintenance treatment. A fixed dose of 1 400 mg was found to result in noninferior serum trough concentrations to the intravenous formulation. Clinical trials in the induction setting in patients with follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are currently ongoing.","['Bittner, B', 'Richter, W F', 'Hourcade-Potelleret, F', 'Herting, F', 'Schmidt, J']","['Bittner B', 'Richter WF', 'Hourcade-Potelleret F', 'Herting F', 'Schmidt J']","['F.

Current treatment protocols for haematological malignancies allow most patients to obtain some form of MRD state, but cure seldom follows and in most cases fatal relapses occur sooner or later, leaving a bitter impression of having won a battle yet lost the war. MRD detection and quantification are used for evaluation of treatment efficiency, patient risk stratification and long-term outcome prediction. Whereas multicolour flow cytometry (MCFC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods constitute the two most commonly used techniques for MRD detection, next generation sequencing will certainly be widely employed in the future. As MRD reflects the nature of the malignant disease itself, including its sensitivity to the drug regimens applied, it constitutes the ideal method for surveillance and patient follow-up. The morphological examination of peripheral blood or bone marrow smears, although still an indispensable part of routine laboratory testing, is clearly insufficient for patient management, and clinicians should not ask themselves whether to look for MRD or not, but how and when.","['Hauwel, Mathieu', 'Matthes, Thomas']","['Hauwel M', 'Matthes T']","['University Hospital Geneva, Switzerland; mathieu.hauwel@hcuge.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140122,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population Surveillance/*methods']",,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4414/smw.2014.13907 [doi]', 'smw-13907 [pii]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2014 Jan 22;144:w13907. doi: 10.4414/smw.2014.13907.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the antitumor activity of CDAII on human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines via the mitochondrial pathway was first revealed. The human MM cell lines were exposed to CDAII. Cytotoxicity, caspase activation, apoptosis and the effects on the mitochondrial pathway were assessed. CDA was capable of decreasing the depolarized mitochondrial membranes and activating caspase3 and 9 and poly (ADPribose) polymerase in MM cells treated with CDAII. CDAII induced caspasedependent cell death accompanied by a significant decrease in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin and Mcl1 levels. The caspase3 inhibitor, ZDEVDFMK, inhibited CDAIIinduced apoptosis. CDAII potently increased the Bax levels, decreased the Bcl2/Bax ratio and decreased the expression of the downstream targets of NFkappaB. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that CDAII treatment leads to the inhibition of p65 nuclear localization and potently induces caspasedependent apoptosis in MM cells mediated through the mitochondrial pathway at low nanomolar concentrations. These results indicate that CDAII is a novel inhibitor of NFkappaB activity, with notable antimyeloma efficacy. This study provides a rationale for the clinical investigation of CDA in human MM.","['Yang, Min', 'Huang, Jian', 'Ma, Qiu-Ling', 'Xu, Gai-Xiang', 'Jin, Jie']","['Yang M', 'Huang J', 'Ma QL', 'Xu GX', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.R.

The aims of this study are to describe the occurrence of overweight and obesity, exercise frequency, and the extent of disordered eating patterns in this sample of survivors, and to examine relationships among BMI, eating patterns, exercise frequency, and demographic and disease and treatment-related variables to identify those survivors most at risk for overweight/obesity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 98 cancer survivors (50 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 48 brain tumor [BT]), aged 12 to 17 years and >/=12 months posttreatment from a large pediatric oncology hospital. Survivors completed health behavior measures assessing disordered eating patterns and physical activity. Clinical variables were obtained through medical record review. Univariate analyses were conducted to make comparisons on health behaviors by diagnosis, gender, treatment history, and BMI category. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of ALL survivors and 41.7% of BT survivors were classified as overweight/obese. Overweight/obesity status was associated with higher cognitive restraint (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.1). Only 12% of ALL survivors and 8.3% of BT survivors met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical activity. Males reported more physical activity, t(96) = 2.2, P < .05. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obese survivors may attempt to purposefully restrict their food intake and rely less on physiological cues to regulate consumption. Survivors should be screened at follow-up for weight-related concerns.","['Hansen, Jennifer A', 'Stancel, Heather H', 'Klesges, Lisa M', 'Tyc, Vida L', 'Hinds, Pamela S', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Kahalley, Lisa S']","['Hansen JA', 'Stancel HH', 'Klesges LM', 'Tyc VL', 'Hinds PS', 'Wu S', 'Hudson MM', 'Kahalley LS']","[""1Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Mass Index', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', '*Survivors']",PMC4089040,2014/01/24 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1043454213515548 [pii]', '10.1177/1043454213515548 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2014 Jan-Feb;31(1):41-50. doi: 10.1177/1043454213515548.

However, geographic differences exist in standard adjuvant treatments: postoperative chemoradiation in North America, perioperative chemotherapy in the United Kingdom, and postoperative chemotherapy in East Asia. Now that D2 gastrectomy has been recognized as the optimal surgery for localized gastric cancer in the West as well as in Asia, the standard adjuvant treatments used in the West may need to be reconsidered. One of the most important issues in adjuvant therapy for localized gastric cancer is how to improve the clinical outcomes of current standard treatments. Recent Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and AMC studies suggest that simply intensifying chemotherapy by adding more agents or prolonging treatment duration is insufficient. However, new strategies like early initiation of chemotherapy and/or intraperitoneal chemotherapy may further improve the current standard adjuvant therapy. In the era of targeted therapy, the role of biologic agents for gastric cancer should also be explored in the adjuvant setting. With a deeper understanding of the molecular biology of gastric cancer, adjuvant therapy for patients with localized gastric cancer can be optimized and individualized.","['Kang, Yoon-Koo', 'Yoo, Changhoon']","['Kang YK', 'Yoo C']","['From the Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'From the Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Unlike CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks a common genetic aberration but does demonstrate constitutive activation of PI3-kinase (PI3K) as compared to normal B cells. This constitutively active PI3K in CLL likely relates to tonic B-cell receptor signaling that is present across a wide variety of B-cell malignancies. Although PI3K is quite proximal and represents an ideal target to pharmacologically modulate, the complexity of this pathway on which many normal functions are dependent had for many years been problematic. The p110 delta isoform of PI3K is relatively specific to hematopoietic cells, and elegant mouse studies where p110 delta was genetically inactivated demonstrated only a selective B-cell defect. Subsequent development of a potent, selective p110 delta inhibitor prompted translation into the clinic for the treatment of CLL and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). From the first patient treated where a dramatic early nodal response was noted, considerable excitement has developed for this class of drugs in CLL and NHL. We will summarize the development process of CAL-101 (now GS1101) in the treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies such as CLL.","['Byrd, John C', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Byrd JC', 'Woyach JA', 'Johnson AJ']","['From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

However, clinical features (age and initial white blood cell count [WBC]), early treatment response, and the presence/absence of specific sentinel genomic lesions can identify subsets of high-risk (HR) ALL patients with a much higher risk of treatment failure. Chemotherapy regimens used to treat HR ALL have been refined over the past 3 decades through randomized clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) in North America and the Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) group in Western Europe. Contemporary COG HR ALL treatment regimens were developed from the BFM-76 regimen, with subsequent changes that led to development and refinement of a so-called augmented BFM (ABFM) regimen used today. Although contemporary COG and BFM treatment regimens are not identical, there are many more similarities than differences. With improvements in survival, it has become clear that although the outcome of some patients with HR ALL can be improved by optimizing use of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, this approach has had only limited success for other patient subsets. In contrast, introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has led to dramatic outcome improvements for children and adolescents with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Genomic studies are identifying new sentinel genomic lesions that can serve as potential therapeutic targets, which will likely lead to the testing of novel and/or targeted therapies in more children with HR ALL. Such studies will require increased collaboration between Western European and North American cooperative groups.","['Hunger, Stephen P']",['Hunger SP'],"[""From the Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO; Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Therefore, preclinical and clinical research in recent years has focused intensely on the development of new therapies targeted to JAK2. These efforts culminated in recent approval of ruxolitinib as the first official therapy for patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF). Therapy with JAK2 inhibitors substantially improves quality of life and reduces organomegaly in MF with or without JAKV617F mutation. Recent results suggest that patients with advanced MF may live longer when receiving therapy with ruxolitinib. However, JAK2 inhibitors do not eliminate the disease and new medications are needed to expand on the benefits seen with JAK2 inhibitors. Although many agents are still in the early stages of development, the wealth of publications and presentations has continued to support our growing understanding of the pathophysiology of MF as well as the potential short- and long-term outcomes of these new and diverse approaches to treatment. Focus of ongoing efforts is particularly on the improvements in anemia and fibrosis, as well as on rational combination trials of JAK2 inhibitors and other potentially active agents.

The only potentially curative treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), but since CLL is a disease of elderly patients, few patients are candidates for myeloablative allogeneic SCT. Although autologous SCT is feasible and has low treatment-related mortality, it is not curative. The widespread adoption of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic SCT has made this approach applicable to the elderly patient population with CLL. This approach relies on the documented graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and is strong in CLL. Steps to further decrease the morbidity and mortality of the RIC SCT and in particular to reduce the incidence of chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain a major focus. Many potential treatments are available for CLL, and appropriate patient selection and SCT timing remain controversial and the focus of ongoing clinical trials. The use of SCT must always be weighed against the risk of the underlying disease, particularly in a setting where improvements in treatment are leading to improved outcome. The major challenge remains how to identify which patients with CLL merit this approach and where in the treatment course this treatment can be applied optimally.","['Gribben, John G']",['Gribben JG'],"['From the Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

The ability to accurately predict response to therapy, as well as subsequent duration of response to therapy, is required given the variability of current therapies to induce and sustain treatment responses. The holy grail of prognostics would be to state with accuracy which therapy or types of therapy are best for a given patient.

But fundamentally, the phrase creates the expectation that decisions can be informed by the unique features of the patient and patient's cancer. Much like determining antibiotic sensitivities in urinary tract infections, the oncologist is expected to choose the right treatment(s), for each individual patient. Numerous methods can be used to ""personalize"" management decisions, although truly useful biomarkers continue to escape our grasp. Positron Emission Tomography in patients with GI stromal tumors or genotyping of c-kit in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells can guide the use of imatinib, these scenarios represent a minority of patients. The promise of individualized therapy, however, has led to the commercialization of numerous assays to probe patient's genetic make-up and that of the tumor. Breast cancer management has benefitted from the analysis of gene recurrence scores. More recently the analysis of germline or tumor-associated mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma has led to clinically meaningful molecular subsets of these diseases, guiding the successful targeting of such cancers with small-molecule inhibitors. Despite the high incidence of colorectal cancer and our relatively long-standing grasp of the molecular pathways in colorectal carcinogenesis, the management of these patients remains mostly empiric and movement toward ""personalization"" has been slow and incremental.

Imatinib mesylate, a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), transformed the course of CML from a rapidly fatal disease (median survival, 3 to 6 years) to a functionally curable, indolent disease with an estimated median survival of more than 25 years. This transformation can be attributed to several key factors: the identification of a causal and actionable molecular aberration-BCR-ABL; the development of a potent and selective Bcr-Abl TKI-imatinib; and, importantly the application of imatinib in the earliest phase of CML. In contrast, imatinib, if used in CML blastic phase, improves median survival to only about 1 year. Similar to CML blastic phase, metastatic solid malignancies have undergone genetic evolution, and their molecular aberrations are complex. As a result, resistance is common and eradication is difficult. The key to the dramatic improvement in the survival of patients with CML involved using imatinib in newly diagnosed disease, before blastic transformation. We hypothesize that metastatic solid tumors are analogous to CML blastic phase, and that to achieve improvements in solid tumor outcomes similar to those seen in CML, application of targeted agents to newly diagnosed disease may be required to prevent disease transformation (i.e., metastases). Targeting driver mutations at the time of diagnosis may be critical to the goal of markedly changing the outlook for patients with cancer.","['Westin, Jason R', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kurzrock, Razelle']","['Westin JR', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kurzrock R']","['From the Department of Leukemia; Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma; Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

RNA-interference drug modifier screens identified antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members as potent 5-Azacytidine-sensitizing targets. In further dissecting BCL-XL, BCL-2 and MCL-1 contribution to 5-Azacytidine activity, siRNA silencing of BCL-XL and MCL-1, but not BCL-2, exhibited variable synergy with 5-Azacytidine in vitro. The BCL-XL, BCL-2 and BCL-w inhibitor ABT-737 sensitized most cell lines more potently compared with the selective BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199, which synergized with 5-Azacytidine mostly at higher doses. Ex vivo, ABT-737 enhanced 5-Azacytidine activity across primary AML, MDS and MPN specimens. Protein levels of BCL-XL, BCL-2 and MCL-1 in 577 AML patient samples showed overlapping expression across AML FAB subtypes and heterogeneous expression within subtypes, further supporting a concept of dual/multiple BCL-2 family member targeting consistent with RNAi and pharmacologic results. Consequently, silencing of MCL-1 and BCL-XL increased the activity of ABT-199. Functional interrogation of BCL-2 family proteins by BH3 profiling performed on patient samples significantly discriminated clinical response versus resistance to 5-Azacytidine-based therapies. On the basis of these results, we propose a clinical trial of navitoclax (clinical-grade ABT-737) combined with 5-Azacytidine in myeloid malignancies, as well as to prospectively validate BH3 profiling in predicting 5-Azacytidine response.","['Bogenberger, J M', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Pierceall, W E', 'Lena, R', 'Chow, D', 'Shi, C-X', 'Mantei, J', 'Ahmann, G', 'Gonzales, I M', 'Choudhary, A', 'Valdez, R', 'Camoriano, J', 'Fauble, V', 'Tiedemann, R E', 'Qiu, Y H', 'Coombes, K R', 'Cardone, M', 'Braggio, E', 'Yin, H', 'Azorsa, D O', 'Mesa, R A', 'Stewart, A K', 'Tibes, R']","['Bogenberger JM', 'Kornblau SM', 'Pierceall WE', 'Lena R', 'Chow D', 'Shi CX', 'Mantei J', 'Ahmann G', 'Gonzales IM', 'Choudhary A', 'Valdez R', 'Camoriano J', 'Fauble V', 'Tiedemann RE', 'Qiu YH', 'Coombes KR', 'Cardone M', 'Braggio E', 'Yin H', 'Azorsa DO', 'Mesa RA', 'Stewart AK', 'Tibes R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Lab Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140123,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",PMC4131248,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/10/08 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201444 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.44 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Aug;28(8):1657-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.44.

However, the domain structure(s), signaling pathway and the intracellular events responsible for THP-enhanced PMN phagocytosis remain to be elucidated. THP was purified from normal human urine. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was induced to differentiate into PMNs by all-trans retinoid acid. Pretreatment with different MAPK and PI3K inhibitors was used to delineate signaling pathways in THP-enhanced PMN phagocytosis. Phosphorylation of molecules responsible for PMN phagocytosis induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), THP, or human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) was evaluated by western blot. A p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, effectively inhibited both spontaneous and LPS- and THP-induced PMN phagocytosis. Both THP and LPS enhanced the expression of the Rho family proteins Cdc42 and Rac that may lead to F-actin re-arrangement. Further studies suggested that THP and EGF enhance PMN and differentiated HL-60 cell phagocytosis in a similar pattern. Furthermore, the EGF receptor inhibitor GW2974 significantly suppressed THP- and EGF-enhanced PMN phagocytosis and p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in differentiated HL-60 cells. We conclude that EGF receptor-dependent signaling may be involved in THP-enhanced PMN phagocytosis by activating Rho family and MAP kinase.","['Li, Ko-Jen', 'Siao, Sue-Cien', 'Wu, Cheng-Han', 'Shen, Chieh-Yu', 'Wu, Tsai-Hung', 'Tsai, Chang-Youh', 'Hsieh, Song-Chou', 'Yu, Chia-Li']","['Li KJ', 'Siao SC', 'Wu CH', 'Shen CY', 'Wu TH', 'Tsai CY', 'Hsieh SC', 'Yu CL']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University College of Medicine, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. dtmed170@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei 10002, Taiwan. syuecian@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei 10002, Taiwan. chenghanwu@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei 10002, Taiwan. tsichhl@gmail.com.', 'Section of Nephrology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. wuth@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'Section of Allergy, Immunology & Rheumatology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. cytsai@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei 10002, Taiwan. hsiehsc@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei 10002, Taiwan. chialiyu@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Uromodulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Uromodulin/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC6271557,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules19011328 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules19011328 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2014 Jan 21;19(1):1328-43. doi: 10.3390/molecules19011328.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous study showed its antimicrobial, acaricidal and analgesic activities. Two compounds were isolated from essential oil of T. riparia leaves and identified as 9beta,13beta-epoxy-7-abietene (1), a new one, and 6,7-dehydroroyleanone (2), already reported for another plant. The structure of these compounds was determined by spectroscopic analysis and by comparison with literature data. The cytotoxic activities of the essential oil and compounds 1 and 2 were determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and by tumor cells MDA-MB-435 (human breast carcinoma), HCT-8 (human colon), SF-295 (human nervous system) and HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia).

PEG was conjugated with CSOAA backbone via amide bond formation and the final product was verified by (1)H NMR analysis. Using the synthesized CSOAA-PEG, nanoparticles having characteristics of a 166-nm mean diameter, positive zeta potential, and spherical shape were produced for the delivery of DOX. The mean diameter of CSOAA-PEG nanoparticles in the serum solution (50% fetal bovine serum) remained relatively constant over 72 h as compared with CSOAA nanoparticles (changes of 20.92% and 223.16%, respectively). The sustained release pattern of DOX from CSOAA-PEG nanoparticles was displayed at physiological pH, and the release rate increased under the acidic pH conditions. The cytotoxicity of the CSOAA-PEG conjugate was negligible in human leukemia cells (K562) at the concentrations tested ( approximately 100 mug/ml). The uptake rate of DOX from the nanoparticles by K562 cells was higher than that from the solution. Judging from the results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats, in vivo clearance rate of DOX from the CSOAA-PEG nanoparticle group was slower than other groups, subsequently extending the circulation period.

Tumor persistence or recurrence after NY-ESO-1-specific therapy occurs, however, and the mechanisms of recurrence remain poorly defined. In a murine xenograft model of NY-ESO-1(+) multiple myeloma, we observed tumor recurrence after adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cells genetically redirected to the prototypic NY-ESO-1157-165 peptide presented by HLA-A*02:01. Analysis of the myeloma cells that had escaped from T-cell control revealed intact expression of NY-ESO-1 and B2M, but selective, complete loss of HLA-A*02:01 expression from the cell surface. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involving the HLA-A locus was identified in the tumor cells, and further analysis revealed selective loss of the allele encoding HLA-A*02:01. Although LOH involving the MHC has not been described in myeloma patients with persistent or recurrent disease after immune therapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), it has been described in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia who relapsed after allogeneic HCT. These results suggest that MHC loss should be evaluated in patients with myeloma and other cancers who relapse after adoptive NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell therapy.","['Klippel, Z K', 'Chou, J', 'Towlerton, A M', 'Voong, L N', 'Robbins, P', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Warren, E H']","['Klippel ZK', 'Chou J', 'Towlerton AM', 'Voong LN', 'Robbins P', 'Bensinger WI', 'Warren EH']","['1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Molecular Biosciences, Northwestern University, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140123,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (peptide NY-ESO-1 157-165)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*genetics/immunology', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', '*Tumor Escape']",PMC4040020,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/11/08 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201387 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2013.87 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2014 Mar;21(3):337-42. doi: 10.1038/gt.2013.87.

Effective therapies with acceptable side-effect profiles are needed for this patient population. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of idelalisib, an oral inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. We randomly assigned 220 patients with decreased renal function, previous therapy-induced myelosuppression, or major coexisting illnesses to receive rituximab and either idelalisib (at a dose of 150 mg) or placebo twice daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. At the first prespecified interim analysis, the study was stopped early on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board owing to overwhelming efficacy. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the placebo group and was not reached in the idelalisib group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the idelalisib group, 0.15; P<0.001). Patients receiving idelalisib versus those receiving placebo had improved rates of overall response (81% vs. 13%; odds ratio, 29.92; P<0.001) and overall survival at 12 months (92% vs. 80%; hazard ratio for death, 0.28; P=0.02). Serious adverse events occurred in 40% of the patients receiving idelalisib and rituximab and in 35% of those receiving placebo and rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of idelalisib and rituximab, as compared with placebo and rituximab, significantly improved progression-free survival, response rate, and overall survival among patients with relapsed CLL who were less able to undergo chemotherapy.

The aim of the study was to evaluate VRE colonization in patients hospitalized at the Hematology Intensive Care Unit, as well as the associated risk factors. METHODS: A prospective cohort study involved 70 patients hospitalized at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Clinic for Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, during 3 months. Baseline demographic data, data about antibiotic usage and other risk factors for VRE colonization during the present and previous hospitalizations (within 6 months) were recorded for each patient using the questionnaire. Feces or rectal swab was collected for culture from patients on admission and at discharge in case when VRE was not isolated on admission. Enterococci were isolated by standard microbiological methods. Isolate sensitivity was tested by disk-diffusion test using 30 microg/mL (BBL) Vancomycin plates according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard. RESULTS: Analysing results showed that 7% of the patients had been already colonized with VRE upon ICU admission. The rate of VRE colonization during present hospitalization was 41.5%. Univariate logistic regression demonstrated the statistically significant differences in diagnosis, length of present stay, use of aminoglycosides and piperacillin/tazobactam in present hospitalization, duration of use of carbapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam in present hospitalization between the VRE-colonized and non-colonized patients. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), use of carbapenem in previous hospitalization and duration of use of piperacillin/tazobactam in present hospitalization were independent risk factors for VRE-colonized patients according to multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSION: VRE colonization rate was high among the patients admitted to hematology ICU. Rational use of antibiotics and active surveillance may be helpful preventive measures against the development of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.","['Mioljevic, Vesna', 'Markovic-Denic, Ljiljana', 'Vidovic, Ana', 'Jovanovic, Milica', 'Tosic, Tanja', 'Tomin, Dragica']","['Mioljevic V', 'Markovic-Denic L', 'Vidovic A', 'Jovanovic M', 'Tosic T', 'Tomin D']","['Department of Hospital Epidemiology and Hygiene, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. vesna.mioljevic@gmail.com', 'Institute of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Microbiology Department, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Microbiology Department, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cross Infection/*microbiology', 'Enterococcus/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Vancomycin Resistance', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/24 06:00,2014/05/21 06:00,['2014/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/vsp1312109m [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2013 Dec;70(12):1109-16. doi: 10.2298/vsp1312109m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk to oncology personnel handling anti-cancer agents has also been documented by non-specific measures of genotoxicity in blood and urine. Using chromosomal markers applied in clinical practice, we previously demonstrated in oncology workers, a dose-related increase in abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7, known to be targets of alkylating agent exposure. In the analysis presented here, we extended that work to also assess damage resulting from non-alkylating drug exposure. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from oncology personnel (N = 63) and non-exposed controls (N = 46) was collected and examined using the fluorescent in situ hybridization technique with probes for targets on chromosomes 5, 7, and 11. Participants recorded drug handling events over a 6 week period. Important co-variates were considered. Examining chromosomal outcomes as a function of drug handling frequency, we employed Poisson Regression to obtain incident rate ratios (IRRs) for selected drug handling frequencies. We found a dose-related increase in the IRR for aberrations in all three chromosomes 5, 7, and 11, reaching statistical significance for chromosome 5, as a function of non-alkylating drug handling. This suggests that the targeting of chromosome 5 is not limited to alkylating agent exposure, as some recent evidence in treated patients has also shown. Thus, the pattern of insult observed in treated patients appears to extend to oncology personnel exposed in the workplace.","['McDiarmid, Melissa A', 'Rogers, Bonnie', 'Oliver, Marc S']","['McDiarmid MA', 'Rogers B', 'Oliver MS']","['University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140121,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', '*Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis']",,2014/01/23 06:00,2014/05/21 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.21852 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2014 May;55(4):369-74. doi: 10.1002/em.21852.

This work developed and validated an updated prognostic model to predict OS in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Data from a phase III trial of 1,050 patients with mCRPC were used (Cancer and Leukemia Group B CALGB-90401 [Alliance]). The data were randomly split into training and testing sets. A separate phase III trial served as an independent validation set. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator selected eight factors prognostic for OS. A predictive score was computed from the regression coefficients and used to classify patients into low- and high-risk groups. The model was assessed for its predictive accuracy using the time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC). RESULTS: The model included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, disease site, lactate dehydrogenase, opioid analgesic use, albumin, hemoglobin, prostate-specific antigen, and alkaline phosphatase. Median OS values in the high- and low-risk groups, respectively, in the testing set were 17 and 30 months (hazard ratio [HR], 2.2; P < .001); in the validation set they were 14 and 26 months (HR, 2.9; P < .001). The tAUCs were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.73) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.76) in the testing and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: An updated prognostic model for OS in patients with mCRPC receiving first-line chemotherapy was developed and validated on an external set. This model can be used to predict OS, as well as to better select patients to participate in trials on the basis of their prognosis.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Lin, Chen-Yen', 'Kelly, W Kevin', 'Fizazi, Karim S', 'Moul, Judd W', 'Kaplan, Ellen B', 'Morris, Michael J', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Lin CY', 'Kelly WK', 'Fizazi KS', 'Moul JW', 'Kaplan EB', 'Morris MJ', 'Small EJ']","['Susan Halabi, Chen-Yen Lin, and Ellen B.

The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is also frequently involved in chromosomal translocations or partial tandem duplication in acute leukemia. The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. RUNX1/CBFbeta recruits MLL to regulate downstream target genes. However, the functional consequence of MLL fusions on RUNX1/CBFbeta activity has not been fully understood. In this report, we show that MLL fusion proteins and the N-terminal MLL portion of MLL fusions downregulate RUNX1 and CBFbeta protein expression via the MLL CXXC domain and flanking regions. We confirmed this finding in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice and human M4/M5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, with or without MLL translocations, showing that MLL translocations cause a hypomorph phenotype of RUNX1/CBFbeta. Overexpression of RUNX1 inhibits the development of AML in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice; conversely, further reducing Runx1/Cbfbeta levels accelerates MLL-AF9-mediated AML in bone marrow transplantation assays. These data reveal a newly defined negative regulation of RUNX1/CBFbeta by MLL fusion proteins and suggest that targeting RUNX1/CBFbeta levels may be a potential therapy for MLLs.","['Zhao, Xinghui', 'Chen, Aili', 'Yan, Xiaomei', 'Zhang, Yue', 'He, Fuhong', 'Hayashi, Yoshihiro', 'Dong, Yunzhu', 'Rao, Yalan', 'Li, Bo', 'Conway, Rajeana M', 'Maiques-Diaz, Alba', 'Elf, Shannon E', 'Huang, Nuomin', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Xiao, Zhijian', 'Tse, William', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Wang, Qianfei', 'Chen, Wei', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Huang, Gang']","['Zhao X', 'Chen A', 'Yan X', 'Zhang Y', 'He F', 'Hayashi Y', 'Dong Y', 'Rao Y', 'Li B', 'Conway RM', 'Maiques-Diaz A', 'Elf SE', 'Huang N', 'Zuber J', 'Xiao Z', 'Tse W', 'Tenen DG', 'Wang Q', 'Chen W', 'Mulloy JC', 'Nimer SD', 'Huang G']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC4067497,2014/01/23 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35896-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-489575 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 13;123(11):1729-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-489575.

We demonstrate that this process is histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent, that it is mediated through the downregulation of CD48 messenger RNA, and that treatment with HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) restores the expression of CD48. Furthermore, by using chromatin immunoprecepitation (ChIP) experiments, we show that AML1-ETO directly interacts with CD48.

Patients received 15 PEGasparaginase infusions (2500 IU/m(2) every 2 weeks) in intensification after receiving native E coli asparaginase in induction. In case of allergy to or silent inactivation of PEGasparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase (20 000 IU/m(2) 2-3 times weekly) was given. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the PEGasparaginase study. Twenty (22%) of the PEGasparaginase-treated patients developed an allergy; 7 (8%) showed silent inactivation. The PEGasparaginase level was 0 in all allergic patients (grade 1-4). Patients without hypersensitivity to PEGasparaginase had serum mean trough levels of 899 U/L. Fifty-nine patients were included in the Erwinia asparaginase study; 2 (3%) developed an allergy and none silent inactivation. Ninety-six percent had at least 1 trough level >/=100 U/L. The serum asparagine level was not always completely depleted with Erwinia asparaginase in contrast to PEGasparaginase. The presence of asparaginase antibodies was related to allergies and silent inactivation, but with low specificity (64%). Use of native E coli asparaginase in induction leads to high hypersensitivity rates to PEGasparaginase in intensification. Therefore, PEGasparaginase should be used upfront in induction, and we suggest that the dose could be lowered. Switching to Erwinia asparaginase leads to effective asparaginase levels in most patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been added to our ALL-11 protocol to individualize asparaginase therapy.","['Tong, Wing H', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'te Loo, D Maroeska W M', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Kollen, Wouter J W', 'Hop, Wim C J', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky, Claudia', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'van der Sluis, Inge M']","['Tong WH', 'Pieters R', 'Kaspers GJ', 'te Loo DM', 'Bierings MB', 'van den Bos C', 'Kollen WJ', 'Hop WC', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky C', 'Relling MV', 'Tissing WJ', 'van der Sluis IM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Erwinia/*enzymology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3968389,2014/01/23 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35820-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-534347 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 27;123(13):2026-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-534347.

The disturbance of the balance in the hematopoietic progenitor pool can result in favorable conditions for development of diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia. It has been shown recently that mice lacking p15Ink4b have skewed differentiation of common myeloid progenitors toward the myeloid lineage at the expense of erythroid progenitors. The lack of p15INK4B expression in human leukemic blasts has been linked to poor prognosis and increased risk of myelodysplastic syndromes transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. However, the role of p15Ink4b in disease development is just beginning to be elucidated. This study examines the collaboration of the loss of p15Ink4b with Nup98-HoxD13 translocation in the development of hematological malignancies in a mouse model. Here, we report that loss of p15Ink4b collaborates with Nup98-HoxD13 transgene in the development of predominantly myeloid neoplasms, namely acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative disease, and myelodysplastic syndromes. This mouse model could be a very valuable tool for studying p15Ink4b function in tumorigenesis as well as preclinical drug testing.","['Humeniuk, Rita', 'Koller, Richard', 'Bies, Juraj', 'Aplan, Peter', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Humeniuk R', 'Koller R', 'Bies J', 'Aplan P', 'Wolff L']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd13 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/deficiency/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC7640373,2014/01/23 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1635 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2014 May;32(5):1361-6. doi: 10.1002/stem.1635.,,,,"['Z01 BC010983/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC011027/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1639109'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nup98-HoxD13', 'Transgenic mouse', 'p15Ink4b']",,,,,['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,

Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory condition of the lung for which standard treatment is mainly supportive due to lack of effective therapies. Our recent studies have demonstrated the ability of both human ASCs (hASCs) and mouse ASCs (mASCs) to attenuate lung damage and inflammation in a rodent model of lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI, suggesting that ASCs may also be beneficial in treating ALI. To better understand how ASCs may act in ALI and to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in ASC modulation of lung inflammation, gene expression analysis was performed in ASC-treated (hASCs or mASCs) and control sham-treated lungs. The results revealed a dramatic difference between the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules by hASCs and mASCs. These data show that the beneficial effects of hASCs and mASCs in ALI may result from the production of different paracrine factors. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression in the mASC-treated lungs was significantly elevated as compared to sham-treated controls 20 hours after delivery of the cells by oropharyngeal aspiration. Knockdown of IL-6 expression in mASCs by RNA interference abrogated most of their therapeutic effects, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory properties of mASCs in ALI are explained, at least in part, by activation of IL-6 secretion.","['Zhang, Shijia', 'Danchuk, Svitlana D', 'Bonvillain, Ryan W', 'Xu, Beibei', 'Scruggs, Brittni A', 'Strong, Amy L', 'Semon, Julie A', 'Gimble, Jeffrey M', 'Betancourt, Aline M', 'Sullivan, Deborah E', 'Bunnell, Bruce A']","['Zhang S', 'Danchuk SD', 'Bonvillain RW', 'Xu B', 'Scruggs BA', 'Strong AL', 'Semon JA', 'Gimble JM', 'Betancourt AM', 'Sullivan DE', 'Bunnell BA']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Regenerative Medicine, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",IM,"['Acute Lung Injury/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Adipose Tissue/*cytology', 'Albumins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/metabolism', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Stromal Cells']",PMC4365913,2014/01/23 06:00,2015/01/08 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2013/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1632 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2014 Jun;32(6):1616-28. doi: 10.1002/stem.1632.,,,,['P51 OD011104/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS670824'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lung injury', 'Adipose-derived stromal/stem cell', 'Interleukin 6', 'Mouse']",,,,,['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,

Cord blood units were obtained by intrauterine collection at delivery. They were depleted of plasma and red cells and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tests for total nucleated cells, CD34 cell content, viral serology, bacterial cultures and HLA A, B and DRB1 were done. Six hundred cord blood units were stored by March 2012. Three patients received allogeneic transplant with cord blood from our bank, two with high risk lymphoblastic leukemia and one with severe congenital anemia. They received conditioning regimens according to their disease and usual supportive care for unrelated donor transplantation until full hematopoietic and immune reconstitution was achieved. The three patients had early engraftment of neutrophils and platelets. The child corrected his anemia and the leukemia patients remain in complete remission.

The ultrastructure changes of U937 cells induced by ultrasonic irradiation were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The viability of cells was evaluated by viacount assay. Apoptosis was analyzed using fl ow cytometer as well as fl uorescence microscopy with 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) levels were also analyzed by fl ow cytometer after exposure. Our experiments showed that several distinct sonochemical effects were found after Ce6-mediated SDT treatment. Western blotting analysis indicated that the MAPK were activated. Especially, pre-treatment with ERK inhibitor U0126 could additionally enhance SDT-induced cell viability loss, early- and late-apoptotic rate, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. Besides, a mass of ROS accumulation and a conspicuous loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected in U937 cells. These fi ndings suggested ERK signal pathway may deliver a survival signal which counteracts SDT-induced cell death, while combination with U0126 could significantly potentiate the SDT-induced cytotoxic effect in U937 cells.","['Su, Xiaomin', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Zhang, Kun', 'Yang, Shuang', 'Xue, Qin', 'Wang, Pan', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Su X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang K', 'Yang S', 'Xue Q', 'Wang P', 'Liu Q']","[""College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. wangpan@snnu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Chlorophyllides)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (U 0126)', '5S2CCF3T1Z (phytochlorin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Butadienes/*administration & dosage', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chlorophyllides', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage', 'Porphyrins/*administration & dosage', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/administration & dosage', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'U937 Cells', '*Ultrasonics']",,2014/01/23 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/gpb_2014003 [doi]'],ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2014;33(3):295-309. doi: 10.4149/gpb_2014003.

It remains unclear what roles that BM trephine biopsy plays on relapse assessment. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) sections during complete remission (CR) from 60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were retrospectively analyzed. Computer image processing technology was performed for detection of the distance between precursors and endosteum, and density of precursors was also calculated under light microscopic image. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the immunophenotype of clustered precursors. RESULTS: Except for single and double precursors, there existed clustered precursors of 3-5 cells during CR. Here, we demonstrated that clustered precursors, but not single and double precursors, were useful in risk factor of relapse. Area under the receiving operator curve (ROC) was of 0.007 (CI 95%, from 0.572 to 0.851). Using a standard cut-off value of >4.0/mm(2) for cluster density, early relapse was detected with a sensitivity of 51.5% and a specificity of 85.7%.Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that clustered precursor is an independent risk factor for early relapse (Adjusted HR: 0.325, 95% CI: 0.156-0.679, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulatively, clustered precursors in BM sections during CR may serve as an independent risk factor of early relapse and poor outcome for AML patients in cluster density > 4.0/mm(2) in sections. Early aggressive interventions are needed to prevent hematologic relapse.","['Yu, Yehua', 'Wu, Zhentian', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Zhai, Yuanmei', 'Yuan, Yinghua', 'Liu, Sihong', 'Wang, Hui', 'Shi, Jun']","['Yu Y', 'Wu Z', 'Zhang J', 'Zhai Y', 'Yuan Y', 'Liu S', 'Wang H', 'Shi J']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China. shijun7@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140122,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3901753,2014/01/23 06:00,2014/09/06 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2013/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Jan 22;12:18. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 70 cases of T-LBL/ALL with follow-up data were studied by using immunohistochemical EnVision method for CD1a, CD3, cCD3, CD7, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD34, CD43, CD45RO, CD99, TDT, MPO, bcl-2 and Ki-67. The expression levels of miR-16 were examined by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty cases of reactive lymph node were selected as control. RESULTS: Among the 70 cases of T-LBL/ALL, the percentages of tumor cells expression of TDT, CD99, CD3, CD7, CD10, CD34, CD1a, cCD3, bcl-2, CD45RO and CD43 were 94.3% (66/70), 94.3% (66/70), 68.6% (48/70), 92.9% (65/70), 32.9% (23/70), 24.3% (17/70), 40.0% (28/70), 51.4% (36/70), 34.3% (24/70), 37.1% (26/70), and 48.6% (34/70). Separately, while tumor cells expression of MPO, CD20 and CD23 was all negative. A figure of Ki-67 expression > 80% was found in 24 cases and </= 80% in 46 cases. The expression of miR-16 was up-regulated in T-LBL/ALL, and it was 5.07 times of the reactive lymph node(P = 0.001). The high expression group of miR-16 was significantly correlated with longer over survival (P = 0.041). The prognosis of negative bcl-2 group was better than bcl-2 positive one(P = 0.904). The relationship of miR-16 and bcl-2 was significant(P = 0.042,chi(2) = 4.147). Survival multivariate COX proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that the low expression of miR-16 might be a independent poor prognosis factor (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: While the high expression group of miR-16 has longer OS than that in low expression group. The prognosis of bcl-2 negative was better than bcl-2 positive. miR-16 may be a independent prognosis factor. The relationship of miR-16 and bcl-2 might suggested that gene regulation may be influenced by them.","['Li, Jing', 'Li, Peng', 'Wang, Jin-fen', 'Xi, Yan-feng']","['Li J', 'Li P', 'Wang JF', 'Xi YF']","['Department of Pathology, Shanxi Tumor Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Tumor Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Tumor Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Tumor Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030013, China.

Three patients had bilateral disease (6.7%). The majority of patients had stage III and IV (62.2%). Patients with malformation had an earlier age at diagnosis (P = 0.018) and a higher prevalence of bilateral disease (P = 0.044). Overall survival was 75%. Age at diagnosis was the only significant independent predictor associated with death. CONCLUSION: Death is closely related to late diagnosis in WT. Oncologic services should also be concerned about morbidity caused by therapeutic options in cases of late diagnosis, and the consequences for quality of life.","['Provenzi, Valentina Oliveira', 'Rosa, Rafael Fabiano Machado', 'Rosa, Rosana Cardoso Manique', 'Roehe, Adriana Vial', 'dos Santos, Pedro Paulo Albino', 'Faulhaber, Fabrizia Renno Sodero', 'de Oliveira, Ceres Andreia Vieira', 'Zen, Paulo Ricardo Gazzola']","['Provenzi VO', 'Rosa RF', 'Rosa RC', 'Roehe AV', 'dos Santos PP', 'Faulhaber FR', 'de Oliveira CA', 'Zen PR']","['Conceicao Hospital Group and Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140428,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Latin America', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Wilms Tumor/*epidemiology']",,2014/01/23 06:00,2016/09/09 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ped.12295 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2014 Aug;56(4):534-40. doi: 10.1111/ped.12295.

The 36.7 Mb minimally deleted region on chromosome 5 lies between 5q14.3 and 5q33.3 and contains 634 genes and 15 microRNAs, whereas loss of chromosome 17 spans 3194 kb and involves 342 genes and 12 microRNAs. Loss of a 155 kb region on 5q33.3 (p < 0.05) was associated with achievement of complete remission (CR). In contrast, loss of 17p11.2-q11.1 was associated with a lower CR rate and poorer overall survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis, p < 0.0096). aCGH detected loss of 17p in 12/48 patients as compared to 9/48 by conventional karyotyping.

Phosphorylation of proteins causes changes in their function and/or enzymatic activity resulting in specific biological responses. There are two classes of PTKs: the transmembrane receptor PTKs and the cytoplasmic non-receptor PTKs (NRTKs). NRTKs are involved in transduction of signals originating from extracellular clues, which often interact with transmembrane receptors. Thus, they are important components of signaling pathways which regulate fundamental cellular functions such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, survival, and proliferation. The activity of NRTKs is tightly regulated, and de-regulation and/or overexpression of NRTKs has been implicated in malignant transformation and carcinogenesis. Research on NRTKs has shed light on the mechanisms of a number of cellular processes including those involved in carcinogenesis. Not surprisingly, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in use as treatment for a number of malignancies, and more are under investigation. This review deals with the structure, function, and signaling pathways of nine main families of NRTKs in normal and cancer cells.","['Gocek, Elzbieta', 'Moulas, Anargyros N', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Gocek E', 'Moulas AN', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Protein Biotechnology, Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140122,England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2014/01/23 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408363.2013.874403 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2014 Jun;51(3):125-37. doi: 10.3109/10408363.2013.874403.

However, these primary genetic events are insufficient to drive leukemogenesis. Recently, activating mutations in JAK3 have been identified in other T-cell malignancies. Since JAK3 is essential for T-cell maturation, we analyzed a cohort of 32 T-PLL patients for mutational hot spots in the JAK3 gene using a step-wise screening approach. We identified 14 mutations in 11 of 32 patients (34%). The most frequently detected mutation in our cohort was M511I (seen in 57% of cases) previously described as an activating change in other T-cell malignancies. Three patients carried two mutations in JAK3. In two patients M511I and R657Q were simultaneously detected and in another patient V674F and V678L. In the latter case we could demonstrate that the mutations were on the same allele in cis. Protein modeling and homology analyses of mutations present in other members of the JAK family suggested that these mutations likely activate JAK3, possibly by disrupting the activation loop and the interface between N and C lobes, increasing the accessibility of the catalytic loop. In addition, four of the 21 patients lacking a JAK3 point mutation presented an aberrant karyotype involving the chromosomal band 19p13 harboring the JAK3 locus. The finding of recurrent activating JAK3 mutations in patients with T-PLL could enable the use of JAK3 inhibitors to treat patients with this unfavorable malignancy who otherwise have a very poor prognosis.","['Bergmann, Anke K', 'Schneppenheim, Sina', 'Seifert, Marc', 'Betts, Matthew J', 'Haake, Andrea', 'Lopez, Cristina', 'Maria Murga Penas, Eva', 'Vater, Inga', 'Jayne, Sandrine', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Ammerpohl, Ole', 'Russell, Robert B', 'Kuppers, Ralf', 'Durig, Jan', 'Siebert, Reiner']","['Bergmann AK', 'Schneppenheim S', 'Seifert M', 'Betts MJ', 'Haake A', 'Lopez C', 'Maria Murga Penas E', 'Vater I', 'Jayne S', 'Dyer MJ', 'Schrappe M', 'Duhrsen U', 'Ammerpohl O', 'Russell RB', 'Kuppers R', 'Durig J', 'Siebert R']","['Institute for Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany; Department of Pediatrics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/08/20 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22141 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Apr;53(4):309-16. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22141.

The putative LEUTX protein does not contain any HAT domain, and this is the first study to report that KAT6A can fuse to the homeobox gene. The current study, with identification of a new partner gene to KAT6A in a therapy-related AML, does not elucidate the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in KAT6A-related AML but describes a new gene with a different putative function.","['Chinen, Yoshiaki', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Tsutsumi, Yasuhiko', 'Kobayashi, Satoru', 'Matsumoto, Yosuke', 'Sakamoto, Natsumi', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Nishida, Kazuhiro', 'Ohno, Hirofumi', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Chinen Y', 'Taki T', 'Tsutsumi Y', 'Kobayashi S', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Sakamoto N', 'Kuroda J', 'Horiike S', 'Nishida K', 'Ohno H', 'Uike N', 'Taniwaki M']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LEUTX protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/08/20 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22140 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Apr;53(4):299-308. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22140.

The physicochemical properties of the chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The solubility of chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles was higher at acidic pH, which helps to release more cobalt ions into the medium. Chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles showed good compatibility with normal cells. However, our results showed that exposure of leukemic cells (Jurkat cells) to chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles caused an increase in reactive oxygen species generation that was abolished by pretreatment of cells with the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The apoptosis of Jurkat cells was confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis. Induction of TNF-alpha secretion was observed from stimulation of Jurkat cells with chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles. We also tested the role of TNF-alpha in the induction of Jurkat cell death in the presence of TNF-alpha and caspase inhibitors. Treatment of leukemic cells with a blocker had a greater effect on cancer cell viability. From our findings, oxidative stress and caspase activation are involved in cancer cell death induced by chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles.","['Chattopadhyay, Sourav', 'Dash, Sandeep Kumar', 'Kar Mahapatra, Santanu', 'Tripathy, Satyajit', 'Ghosh, Totan', 'Das, Balaram', 'Das, Debasis', 'Pramanik, Panchanan', 'Roy, Somenath']","['Chattopadhyay S', 'Dash SK', 'Kar Mahapatra S', 'Tripathy S', 'Ghosh T', 'Das B', 'Das D', 'Pramanik P', 'Roy S']","['Immunology and Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Human Physiology with Community Health, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, 721102, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,Germany,J Biol Inorg Chem,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,9616326,"['0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)', 'USK772NS56 (cobalt oxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chitosan/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cobalt/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Oxides/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00775-013-1085-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biol Inorg Chem. 2014 Mar;19(3):399-414. doi: 10.1007/s00775-013-1085-2.

Despite improved clinical outcomes, current CLL therapies are not curative. Therefore, antibodies with greater efficacy and novel targets are desirable. One promising target is CD37, a tetraspanin protein highly expressed on malignant B-cells in CLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although several novel CD37-directed therapeutics are emerging, detailed preclinical evaluation of these agents is limited by lack of appropriate animal models with spontaneous leukemia expressing the human CD37 (hCD37) target. To address this, we generated a murine CLL model that develops transplantable hCD37+ leukemia. Subsequently, we engrafted healthy mice with this leukemia to evaluate IMGN529, a novel hCD37-targeting antibody-drug conjugate. IMGN529 rapidly eliminated peripheral blood leukemia and improved overall survival. In contrast, the antibody component of IMGN529 could not alter disease course despite exhibiting substantial in vitro cytotoxicity. Furthermore, IMGN529 is directly cytotoxic to human CLL in vitro, depletes B-cells in patient whole blood and promotes killing by macrophages and natural killer cells. Our results demonstrate the utility of a novel mouse model for evaluating anti-human CD37 therapeutics and highlight the potential of IMGN529 for treatment of CLL and other CD37-positive B-cell malignancies.","['Beckwith, K A', 'Frissora, F W', 'Stefanovski, M R', 'Towns, W H', 'Cheney, C', 'Mo, X', 'Deckert, J', 'Croce, C M', 'Flynn, J M', 'Andritsos, L A', 'Jones, J A', 'Maddocks, K J', 'Lozanski, G', 'Byrd, J C', 'Muthusamy, N']","['Beckwith KA', 'Frissora FW', 'Stefanovski MR', 'Towns WH', 'Cheney C', 'Mo X', 'Deckert J', 'Croce CM', 'Flynn JM', 'Andritsos LA', 'Jones JA', 'Maddocks KJ', 'Lozanski G', 'Byrd JC', 'Muthusamy N']","['1] Medical Scientist Training Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140121,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', 'WE1X5A83B9 (naratuximab emtansine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Tetraspanins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",PMC4090271,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201432 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.32 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1501-10. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.32.

A core component necessary for this activity is cyclin-dependent kinase 9. Here we explored the effectiveness of small molecules targeting this enzyme as potential therapeutics. A screen of seven compounds with anti-CDK9 activity applied to a panel of leukemia cell lines identified flavopiridol and the experimental inhibitor PC585 as superior in efficacy with inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range. Both substances induced rapid dephosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain, accompanied by downregulation of CDK9-dependent transcripts for MYC and HOXA9. Global gene expression analysis indicated the induction of a general stress response program, culminating in widespread apoptosis. Importantly, colony-forming activity in leukemia lines and primary patient samples could be completely inhibited under conditions that did not affect native precursors from bone marrow. In vivo application in a mouse transplant model significantly delayed disease with PC585 showing also oral activity.

However, it is still poorly understood what additional transcriptional regulators, independent of the MLL fusion pathway, contribute to the development of MLL leukemia. Here we show that the transcription factor PU.1 is essential for MLL leukemia and is required for the growth of MLL leukemic cells via the promotion of cell-cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. Importantly, PU.1 expression is not under the control of MLL fusion proteins. We further identified a PU.1-governed 15-gene signature, which contains key regulators in the MEIS-HOX program (MEIS1, PBX3, FLT3, and c-KIT). PU.1 directly binds to the genomic loci of its target genes in vivo, and is required to maintain active expression of those genes in both normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in MLL leukemia. Finally, the clinical significance of the identified PU.1 signature was indicated by its ability to predict survival in acute myelogenous leukemia patients. Together, our findings demonstrate that PU.1 contributes to the development of MLL leukemia, partially via crosstalk with the MEIS/HOX pathway.","['Zhou, J', 'Wu, J', 'Li, B', 'Liu, D', 'Yu, J', 'Yan,

Furthermore, several classes of epigenetic modifiers have also been identified, in patients with MPN, revealing a requirement for mutations in other pathways to cooperate with JAK-STAT pathway mutations in MPN pathogenesis. Mutations in the de novo DNA methylation protein, DNMT3A, demethylation machinery, TET2 and related IDH1/2 production of oncometabolite 2-hydroxygluterate, and polycomb complex proteins EZH2 and ASXL1 have opened new pathophysiologic clues into these diseases.

Although great advances have been made in understanding the role of these mutated genes in AML disease pathogenesis, to date relatively few have been demonstrated to have direct clinical relevance. RECENT FINDINGS: Genomic techniques have allowed for the identification of many mutated genes that appear to drive disease pathogenesis and prognosis in AML. Integrated analyses examining the co-occurrence of these genes in well annotated AML patient cohorts has helped to significantly refine prognostic models, allowing for a more nuanced selection of patients for optimal postremission therapies. Furthermore, there are emerging data that gene mutations may be useful to select patients for optimal doses and/or modalities of upfront AML therapy. Finally, mutated genes themselves hold promise as therapeutic targets, as supported by strong preclinical studies. SUMMARY: Recent advances in our knowledge of the molecular genetics of AML have significantly improved our tools for clinical decision-making and promise to identify new therapies for patients.","['Chung, Stephen S']",['Chung SS'],"['aHuman Oncology and Pathogenesis Program bLeukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Standard of Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000024 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):87-94. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of BRD4 expression in ESCs did not induce spontaneous differentiation but severely diminished hematoendothelial potential.

Previous findings have suggested a lack of IRF5 transcripts in both acute and chronic leukemias. However, to date, IRF5 expression and function have not been investigated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We report that IRF5 is expressed in CML cells, where it interacts with the BCR-ABL kinase that modulates its expression and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRF5 displayed reduced transcriptional activity that was partially restored by imatinib mesylate (IM). Interestingly, a mutant devoid of a BCR-ABL consensus site (IRF5(Y104F)) still presented significant tyrosine phosphorylation. This finding suggests that the oncoprotein phosphorylates additional tyrosine residues or induces downstream signaling pathways leading to further IRF5 phosphorylation. We also found that ectopic expression of IRF5 decreases the proliferation of CML cell lines by slowing their S-G2 transition, increasing the inhibition of BCR-ABL signaling and enhancing the lethality effect observed after treatment with IM, alpha-2-interferon and a DNA-damaging agent. Furthermore, IRF5 overexpression successfully reduced the clonogenic ability of CML CD34-positive progenitors before and after exposure to the above-indicated cytotoxic stimuli. Our data identify IRF5 as a downstream target of the BCR-ABL kinase, suggesting that its biological inactivation contributes to leukemic transformation.","['Massimino, Michele', 'Consoli, Maria Letizia', 'Mesuraca, Maria', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Buffa, Pietro', 'Bond, Heather M', 'Morrone, Giovanni', 'Sciacca, Laura', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Vigneri, Paolo']","['Massimino M', 'Consoli ML', 'Mesuraca M', 'Stagno F', 'Tirro E', 'Stella S', 'Pennisi MS', 'Romano C', 'Buffa P', 'Bond HM', 'Morrone G', 'Sciacca L', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Manzella L', 'Vigneri P']","['Department of Clinical and Molecular Bio-Medicine, University of Catania, 85-95124 Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140120,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IRF5 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['bgu013 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgu013 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2014 May;35(5):1132-43. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgu013.

The HPV16 capsid is composed of the proteins L1 and L2. After cell entry and virus disassembly, the L2 protein accompanies the viral DNA to promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) within the host nuclei enabling viral transcription and replication. Multiple components of PML-NBs are regulated by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) either based on covalent SUMO modification (SUMOylation), or based on non-covalent SUMO interaction via SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs). We show here that the HPV16 L2 comprises at least one SIM, which is crucial for the L2 interaction with SUMO2 in immunoprecipitation and colocalization with SUMO2 in PML-NBs. Biophysical analysis confirmed a direct L2 interaction with SUMO substantiated by identification of potential L2-SUMO interaction structures in molecular dynamics simulations. Mutation of the SIM resulted in absence of the L2-DNA complex at PML-NB and in a loss of infectivity of mutant HPV16 pseudoviruses. In contrast, we found that L2 SUMOylation has no effect on L2 localization in PML-NBs and SUMO interaction. Our data suggest that the L2 SIM is important for L2 interaction with SUMO and/or SUMOylated proteins, which is indispensable for the delivery of viral DNA to PML-NBs and efficient HPV infection.","['Bund, Timo', 'Spoden, Gilles A', 'Koynov, Kaloian', 'Hellmann, Nadja', 'Boukhallouk, Fatima', 'Arnold, Philipp', 'Hinderberger, Dariush', 'Florin, Luise']","['Bund T', 'Spoden GA', 'Koynov K', 'Hellmann N', 'Boukhallouk F', 'Arnold P', 'Hinderberger D', 'Florin L']","['Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany; Department of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (L2 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human papillomavirus 16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cmi.12271 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2014 Aug;16(8):1179-200. doi: 10.1111/cmi.12271.

We report the first series of adult patients with ARF and HMs treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 14 patients with HMs (aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) n = 5; highly aggressive NHL, that is acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Burkitt lymphoma, n = 5; Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 2; acute myeloid leukemia, n = 1; multiple myeloma, n = 1) receiving ECMO support because of ARF (all data as medians and interquartile ranges; age, 32 years (22 to 51 years); simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II): 51 (42 to 65)). Etiology of ARF was pneumonia (n = 10), thoracic manifestation of NHL (n = 2), sepsis of nonpulmonary origin (n = 1), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (n = 1). Diagnosis of HM was established during ECMO in four patients, and five first received (immuno-) chemotherapy on ECMO. RESULTS: Before ECMO, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 60 (53 to 65), (3.3 to 3.7). Three patients received venoarterial ECMO because of acute circulatory failure in addition to ARF; all other patients received venovenous ECMO. All patients needed vasopressors, and five needed hemofiltration. Thrombocytopenia occurred in all patients (lowest platelet count was 20 (11 to 21) G/L). Five major bleeding events were noted. ECMO duration was 8.5 (4 to 16) days. ICU and hospital survival was 50%. All survivors were alive at follow-up (36 (10 to 58) months); five patients were in complete remission, one in partial remission, and one had relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO therapy is feasible in selected patients with HMs and ARF and can be associated with long-term disease-free survival.","['Wohlfarth, Philipp', 'Ullrich, Roman', 'Staudinger, Thomas', 'Bojic, Andja', 'Robak, Oliver', 'Hermann, Alexander', 'Lubsczyk, Barbara', 'Worel, Nina', 'Fuhrmann, Valentin', 'Schoder, Maria', 'Funovics, Martin', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Knoebl, Paul', 'Laczika, Klaus', 'Locker, Gottfried J', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Schellongowski, Peter']","['Wohlfarth P', 'Ullrich R', 'Staudinger T', 'Bojic A', 'Robak O', 'Hermann A', 'Lubsczyk B', 'Worel N', 'Fuhrmann V', 'Schoder M', 'Funovics M', 'Rabitsch W', 'Knoebl P', 'Laczika K', 'Locker GJ', 'Sperr WR', 'Schellongowski P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140120,England,Crit Care,"Critical care (London, England)",9801902,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/mortality/*trends', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/trends', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']",PMC4055976,2014/01/22 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cc13701 [pii]', '10.1186/cc13701 [doi]']",epublish,Crit Care. 2014 Jan 20;18(1):R20. doi: 10.1186/cc13701.,['Crit Care. 2014;18(5):522.

Of 51 patients with NPM1 mutations, there was no significant difference in 5-yr OS rates between patients with and those without the IDH mutations. In contrast, among 175 patients lacking the NPM1 mutations, 5-yr OS rate in patients with IDH mutations was significantly lower than that in those without IDH mutations (0% vs. 34.7%, P = <0.001).

This multicenter, population-based study assessed the efficacy of Hyper-CVAD as first-line therapy in patients with T-cell ALL (T-ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 2002 and September 2006, 24 patients were diagnosed with T-ALL in Sweden; 19 were eligible for treatment with the protocol. RESULTS: The median age was 32 yr (range 18-72 yr). Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 17 of 19 (89%) patients, and the treatment was relatively well tolerated. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was recommended in high-risk disease and was performed in four patients upfront. Two- and 5-yr leukemia-free survivals (LFS) in 17 patients with CR achievement were identical, at 29% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-51). Two- and 5-yr overall survival (OS) in whole cohort was 63% (95% CI: 42-85) and 47% (95% CI: 26-69), respectively. The 5-yr LFS for 15 patients who did not receive allogeneic SCT upfront were 20% (95% CI: 0-40), although 14 of 15 completed the protocol (eight cycles). Relapse occurred in 2 of 4 upfront-transplanted patients and in 12 of 15 patients treated with chemotherapy alone, six of whom received allogeneic SCT in CR2. Age >/=35 yr influenced OS negatively in univariate analysis (HR 5.1, 95% CI: 1.55-16.7). CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-CVAD treatment resulted in a high CR rate and appeared safe, but it showed poor efficacy at preventing relapse. Therefore, this treatment is no longer recommended for adults with T-ALL in Sweden.","['Kozlowski, Piotr', 'Astrom, Maria', 'Ahlberg, Lucia', 'Bernell, Per', 'Hulegardh, Erik', 'Hagglund, Hans', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Markuszewska-Kuczymska, Alicja', 'Tomaszewska-Toporska, Beata', 'Smedmyr, Bengt', 'Amini, Rose-Marie', 'Hallbook, Helene']","['Kozlowski P', 'Astrom M', 'Ahlberg L', 'Bernell P', 'Hulegardh E', 'Hagglund H', 'Karlsson K', 'Markuszewska-Kuczymska A', 'Tomaszewska-Toporska B', 'Smedmyr B', 'Amini RM', 'Hallbook H']","['Hematology Section, Department of Medicine, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140221,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9842X06Q6M (Betamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Betamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12269 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2014;92(5):377-81. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12269.

In order to highlight the co-operation of epigenetic mechanisms acting during the latter process it is important to clarify their potential as biomarkers of granulocytic differentiation. RESULTS: In this study we investigated epigenetic alterations in human hematopoietic cells at a distinct differentiation stages: primary hematopoietic CD34+ cells, KG1 myeloid leukemic cells, whose development is stopped at early stage of differentiation, and mature neutrophils. We focused on the epigenetic status of cell cycle regulating (p15, p16) and differentiation related (E-cadherin and RARbeta) genes. We found that the methylation level in promoter regions of some of these genes was considerably higher in KG1 cells and lower in CD34+ cells and human neutrophils. As examined and evaluated by computer-assisted methods, histone H3 and H4 modifications, i.e. H3K4Me3, H3K9Ac, H3K9Ac/S10Ph and H4 hyperAc, were similar in CD34+ cells and human mature neutrophils. By contrast, in the KG1 cells, histone H3 and H4 modifications were quite high and increased after induction of granulocytic differentiation with the HDAC inhibitor phenyl butyrate. CONCLUSIONS: We found the methylation status of the examined gene promoters and histone modifications to be characteristically associated with the hematopoietic cell progenitor state, induced to differentiate myeloid KG1 cells and normal blood neutrophils. This could be achieved through epigenetic regulation of E-cadherin, p15, p16 and RARbeta genes expression caused by DNA methylation/demethylation, core and linker histones distribution in stem hematopoietic cells, induced to differentiation KG1 cells and mature human neutrophils, as well as the histone modifications H3K4Me3, H3K9Ac, H3K9Ac/S10Ph and H4 hyperAc in relation to hematopoietic cell differentiation to granulocyte. These findings also suggest them as potentially important biomarkers of hematopoietic cell granulocytic differentiation and could be valuable for leukemia induced differentiation therapy.","['Navakauskiene, Ruta', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika V', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Savickiene, Jurate', 'Matuzevicius, Dalius', 'Navakauskas, Dalius', 'Magnusson, Karl-Eric']","['Navakauskiene R', 'Borutinskaite VV', 'Treigyte G', 'Savickiene J', 'Matuzevicius D', 'Navakauskas D', 'Magnusson KE']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius University, LT-08662 Vilnius, Lithuania. ruta.navakauskiene@bchi.vu.lt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140120,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phenylbutyrates/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3900736,2014/01/22 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2014/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2121-15-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2121-15-4 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2014 Jan 20;15:4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-15-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structures of these metabolites were elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic data, including 1D-, 2D-NMR and MS. In vitro chemosensitization assay indicated that these ardeemins had different activities of reversing the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype in three cancer cell lines, leukemia doxorubicin resistant cell K562/DOX, human lung adenocarcinoma cis-platin-resistant cell A549/DDP, and ovarian cancer cisplatin-resistant cell SK-OV-S/DDP.

We examined survival after relapse for children with AML (non-APML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) in Central America. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of children with first relapse of AML (non-APML) and APML in Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador diagnosed between 1997 and 2011. Predictors of subsequent event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined. RESULTS: We identified 140 children with relapsed AML (non-APML), and 24 with relapsed APML. Two-year subsequent EFS and OS (+/-SE) were 7.0 +/- 2.5% and 9.1 +/- 2.8%, respectively. Worse outcomes were associated with Hispanic or Indigenous heritage, white blood cell count at diagnosis >/=50 x 10(9) /L, and time to relapse <18 months. For those with relapsed APML, subsequent 2-year EFS and OS were 36.7 +/- 10.8% and 43.4 +/- 12.1%, although few patients survived beyond 3 years. 15.2% of all patients were managed solely with palliative intent following first relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Children with relapsed AML in Central America rarely survive, so palliative strategies should be considered following relapse in this population. However, children with late relapse or with APML may have a prolonged period of remission with second treatment, and consideration of re-treatment may be appropriate.","['Marjerrison, Stacey', 'Antillon, Federico', 'Bonilla, Miguel', 'Fu, Ligia', 'Martinez, Roxana', 'Valverde, Patricia', 'Vasquez, Roberto', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Marjerrison S', 'Antillon F', 'Bonilla M', 'Fu L', 'Martinez R', 'Valverde P', 'Vasquez R', 'Howard SC', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Sung L']","[""Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140117,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central America/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*mortality/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24942 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jul;61(7):1222-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24942.

Serum concentration data from a total of 477 patients who received ofatumumab doses ranging from 100 mg to 2000 mg in different dosing regimens were analyzed to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ofatumumab across different patient groups and to identify factors contributing to the pharmacokinetic variability. Ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were well described by a linear two-compartment model component to represent non-specific monoclonal antibody clearance from the central compartment interacting with a model component representing the target-mediated clearance of ofatumumab by binding to CD20 expressed on B cells. The clearance (7.5 mL/h) and steady-state volume of distribution (5.3 L) for the linear, non-specific component were consistent with results obtained for other monoclonal antibodies. The target-mediated clearance component was related to the disease-specific number of circulating B cells, which will allow simulation of the contribution of target-mediated clearance to ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in untested disease states with data on B-cell counts and turnover.","['Struemper, Herbert', 'Sale, Mark', 'Patel, Bela R', 'Ostergaard, Mikkel', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Wierda, William G', 'Hagenbeek, Anton', 'Coiffier, Bertrand', 'Jewell, Roxanne C']","['Struemper H', 'Sale M', 'Patel BR', 'Ostergaard M', 'Osterborg A', 'Wierda WG', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Coiffier B', 'Jewell RC']","['Clinical Pharmacology Modeling and Simulation, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20140128,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD20/chemistry/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/blood/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcph.268 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2014 Jul;54(7):818-27. doi: 10.1002/jcph.268.

In both trials, progression-free survival was increased in the R-FC treatment groups compared with the FC treatment groups. In CLL-8, overall survival was also significantly increased. OBJECTIVE: To develop an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness, from the Australian healthcare perspective, of rituximab when used as a treatment for both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. METHODS: A Markov model with three health states (unprogressed, progressed and death) was developed to extrapolate the trial results over a 15-year time horizon. A treatment algorithm was developed with Australian haematologists to inform the treatments to be modelled. The base-case compares up to three courses of six cycles of R-FC ('first-line' treatment) followed by three courses of post-progression salvage ('Salvage') treatment (including rituximab) with three courses of FC followed by three courses of Salvage treatment (excluding rituximab). Subsequent treatments are incorporated into the model by repeating the unprogressed and progressed health states for each treatment. Time-dependent transition probabilities for the model were estimated from an analysis of individual patient data from CLL-8 and REACH. Comparisons of the hazard rates for the CLL-8 and REACH trials enabled an assessment of the impact on the transitions of receiving the same regimen as the first or second treatment, and hence inform assumptions regarding transitions for third and subsequent treatments. Costs applied in the model were based on published Australian prices in 2009. RESULTS: The model predicts patients receive an average of approximately two courses of treatment, and the addition of rituximab results in an incremental gain of 0.94 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost associated with the addition of rituximab is A$40,268, and hence the cost per QALY gained (QALYG) is A$42,906. CONCLUSION: Rituximab, in combination with chemotherapy, when used multiple times throughout the treatment algorithm, appears to be cost effective for CLL from the Australian healthcare perspective, with a cost/QALYG within the range generally accepted as providing value.","['Adena, Michael', 'Houltram, Jennifer', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Todd, Carlene', 'Malanos, Grace']","['Adena M', 'Houltram J', 'Mulligan SP', 'Todd C', 'Malanos G']","['Datalytics Pty Ltd, Bruce, ACT, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*economics/mortality', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Economic', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40273-013-0125-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2014 Feb;32(2):193-207. doi: 10.1007/s40273-013-0125-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In total, the 25 most common types of cancer were analyzed with mixture cure models using the period approach for estimation of the proportion cured and median survival time of the fatal cases. RESULTS: For several of the cancer types, no estimates could be obtained. The models converged for 14 sites among females and for 15 among males. The highest estimate of the proportion cured was found for cervix cancer (74.0 %; 95 % CI 64.4-83.6) and the lowest for male pancreas cancer (4.6 %; 95 % CI 0.2-9.0). The highest median survival of the uncured was 2.7 years (95 % CI 1.2-6.0) for male larynx cancer and the lowest 0.3 years (95 % CI 0.1-0.6) for male acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). CONCLUSIONS: The estimates seem reliable for stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, cervix, ovary, central nervous system/brain and AML cancer and among men also for head/neck, esophagus, liver and kidney cancer. Altogether, it is demonstrated that even data from a regional cancer registry covering a rather small region can be utilized to derive up-to-date survival estimates of various cancer types, enabling monitoring of the development and changes in cancer treatment. Moreover, potentially this methodology is advantageously employable in any situation where the number of cancer cases is limited.","['Edlinger, Michael', 'Ulmer, Hanno', 'Cvancarova, Milada', 'Oberaigner, Willi']","['Edlinger M', 'Ulmer H', 'Cvancarova M', 'Oberaigner W']","['Department of Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Health Economics, Innsbruck Medical University, Schopfstrasse 41/1, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria, Michael.Edlinger@i-med.ac.at.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140118,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', '*Registries', 'Survival Analysis']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/11/14 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-014-0337-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2014 Mar;25(3):365-73. doi: 10.1007/s10552-014-0337-y.

Also, it has been recently evaluated for their carcinogenic potential to establish permissible limits of exposure at workplaces. We previously reported an increase in the number and size of platelets and their precursor cells and megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen. The aim of this study was to identify the involvement of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor, and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (Mpl), in megakaryocyte proliferation induced by this compound. Mice were exposed twice a week to vanadium pentoxide inhalation (0.02 M) and were killed at 4th, 6th, and 8th week of exposure. Phosphorylated JAK2 (JAK2 ph), STAT3 (STAT3 ph), STAT5, and Mpl were identified in mice spleen megakaryocytes by cytofluorometry and immunohistochemistry. An increase in JAK2 ph and STAT3 ph, but a decrease in Mpl at 8-week exposure was identified in our findings. Taking together, we propose that the morphological findings, JAK/STAT activation, and decreased Mpl receptor induced by V leads to a condition comparable to essential thrombocythemia, so the effect on megakaryocytes caused by different mechanisms is similar. We also suggest that the decrease in Mpl is a negative feedback mechanism after the JAK/STAT activation. Since megakaryocytes are platelet precursors, their alteration affects platelet morphology and function, which might have implications in hemostasis as demonstrated previously, so it is important to continue evaluating the effects of toxics and pollutants on megakaryocytes and platelets.","['Gonzalez-Villalva, Adriana', 'Pinon-Zarate, Gabriela', 'Falcon-Rodriguez, Carlos', 'Lopez-Valdez, Nelly', 'Bizarro-Nevares, Patricia', 'Rojas-Lemus, Marcela', 'Rendon-Huerta, Erika', 'Colin-Barenque, Laura', 'Fortoul, Teresa I']","['Gonzalez-Villalva A', 'Pinon-Zarate G', 'Falcon-Rodriguez C', 'Lopez-Valdez N', 'Bizarro-Nevares P', 'Rojas-Lemus M', 'Rendon-Huerta E', 'Colin-Barenque L', 'Fortoul TI']","['Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico hemadgovi@yahoo.com.mx.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140117,England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,"['0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '00J9J9XKDE (Vanadium)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Janus Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/chemically induced/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Vanadium/*toxicity']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2017/04/19 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['0748233713518600 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233713518600 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2016 May;32(5):908-18. doi: 10.1177/0748233713518600.

The ISD HSCT group functioned significantly better on the role-physical functioning and mental health subscales, as well as the mental component summary (MCS) than the imatinib group. HRQOL was generally comparable to groups in the young population. Multivariate analysis showed that white blood cell count >/= 30 x 10(9)/L and plts count >/= 450 x 10(9)/L were the major adverse factors affecting HRQOL in long-term survivors. Imatinib therapy was also an adverse factor affecting the MCS (odds ratio=1.7, P=0.032).

Even though several studies have been published, no randomized trials comparing directly autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and the accepted conventional therapy (that is, rituximab, fludarabine and CY; R-FC) have been reported so far. To assess the benefit of a first-line aggressive therapy, we designed a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial comparing R-FC and high-dose chemotherapy supported by ASCT in patients under 65 years of age, with stage B(II) or C B-CLL. Primary end point was CR: 96 patients were enrolled (48 in each arm). On an intent-to-treat basis, the CR rates in the ASCT and R-FC arms were 62.5% and 58%, respectively. After 5 years of follow-up, PFS was 60.4% in the ASCT arm and 65.1% in the R-FC arm, time to progression 65.8 and 70.5%, and overall survival 88% vs 88.1%, respectively. Our trial demonstrates, for the first time in a randomized manner, that frontline ASCT does not translate into a survival advantage when compared with benchmark chemoimmunotherapy in B-CLL patients; the possibility of its clinical benefit in certain subgroups remains uncertain.","['Magni, M', 'Di Nicola, M', 'Patti, C', 'Scime, R', 'Mule, A', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Intermesoli, T', 'Viero, P', 'Tarella, C', 'Gueli, A', 'Bergui, L', 'Trentin, L', 'Barzan, A', 'Benedetti, F', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Di Raimondo, F', 'Chiarenza, A', 'Parvis, G', 'Billio, A', 'Attolico, I', 'Olivieri, A', 'Montanari, M', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Matteucci, P', 'Devizzi, L', 'Guidetti, A', 'Viviani, S', 'Valagussa, P', 'Gianni, A M']","['Magni M', 'Di Nicola M', 'Patti C', 'Scime R', 'Mule A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Intermesoli T', 'Viero P', 'Tarella C', 'Gueli A', 'Bergui L', 'Trentin L', 'Barzan A', 'Benedetti F', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Chiarenza A', 'Parvis G', 'Billio A', 'Attolico I', 'Olivieri A', 'Montanari M', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Matteucci P', 'Devizzi L', 'Guidetti A', 'Viviani S', 'Valagussa P', 'Gianni AM']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology I, Azienda Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia-Cervello, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology I, Azienda Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia-Cervello, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology I, Azienda Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia-Cervello, Palermo, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.', 'S.C.D.U.

In this study, ASXL1 mutations were identified in 106 (22.7%) of the 466 patients with primary MDS based on the French-American-British (FAB) classification and 62 (17.1%) of the 362 patients based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. ASXL1 mutation was closely associated with trisomy 8 and mutations of RUNX1, EZH2, IDH, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1 and SRSF2, but was negatively associated with SF3B1 mutation. Most ASXL1-mutated patients (85%) had concurrent other gene mutations at diagnosis. ASXL1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival. Sequential studies showed that the original ASXL1 mutation remained unchanged at disease progression in all 32 ASXL1-mutated patients but were frequently accompanied with acquisition of mutations of other genes, including RUNX1, NRAS, KRAS, SF3B1, SETBP1 and chromosomal evolution. On the other side, among the 80 ASXL1-wild patients, only one acquired ASXL1 mutation at leukemia transformation. In conclusion, ASXL1 mutations in association with other genetic alterations may have a role in the development of MDS but contribute little to disease progression.","['Chen, T-C', 'Hou, H-A', 'Chou, W-C', 'Tang, J-L', 'Kuo, Y-Y', 'Chen, C-Y', 'Tseng, M-H', 'Huang, C-F', 'Lai, Y-J', 'Chiang, Y-C', 'Lee, F-Y', 'Liu, M-C', 'Liu, C-W', 'Liu, C-Y', 'Yao, M', 'Huang, S-Y', 'Ko, B-S', 'Hsu, S-C', 'Wu, S-J', 'Tsay, W', 'Chen, Y-C', 'Tien, H-F']","['Chen TC', 'Hou HA', 'Chou WC', 'Tang JL', 'Kuo YY', 'Chen CY', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Lai YJ', 'Chiang YC', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Liu CY', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Hsu SC', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '1] Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan [2] Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '1] Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Biostatistics Consulting Laboratory, Department of Nursing, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Science, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '1] Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140117,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3913943,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/01/21 06:01,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/21 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201374 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.74 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Jan 17;4:e177. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because AML with CEBPA mutation is closely associated with CD7, CD15, CD34, and HLA-DR expression, we investigated the prognostic implications of CD7+ CD15+ CD34+ HLA-DR + immunophenotype in NK-AML. We analyzed the immunophenotype of 329 patients with NK-AML from the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) AML97 population. NK-AML with the CD7+ CD15+ CD34+ HLA-DR + immunophenotype was classified as the CEBPA type, and NK-AML that did not meet this criterion was considered as the non-CEBPA type. The influence of the CEBPA status on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model. Furthermore, the surface antigen expression profile in AML according to the CEBPA mutation status (monoallelic or biallelic) was also investigated. Of the 329 NK-AML patients that were studied, 39 and 243 were classified as having CEBPA and non-CEBPA type NK-AML, respectively. Patients with CEBPA type NK-AML had significantly better EFS and OS than those with non-CEBPA type NK-AML. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEBPA type and white blood cell (WBC) counts of >20 x 10(9)/L were independent prognostic factors for EFS and OS. Moreover, NK-AML with the biallelic CEBPA mutation was more closely associated with CD34 positivity than that with the monoallelic CEBPA mutation.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a very effective drug for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) but it leads to cardiotoxicity mediated through alterations in various cardiac ion channels and by increasing the intracellular calcium level and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of methanolic extract of apple peel (APME) and aqueous extract of apple peel (APAE) on ATO (5 muM) induced toxicity in the H9c2 cardiac myoblast cell line. We estimated the cellular status of innate antioxidant enzymes, level of ROS, mitochondrial superoxide, glutathione and intracellular calcium with ATO and apple peel extracts. Prior to the cell line based study, we had evaluated the antioxidant potential of apple peel extract by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), total reducing power (TRP), superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, in addition to quantifying total phenolic and flavonoid content. Both the extracts showed considerable antioxidant activity in cell-free chemical assays. In addition, both APME and APAE prevented the alteration in antioxidant status induced by ATO in H9c2 cells. Significant differential alterations had been observed in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, xanthine oxidase, calcium overload and caspase 3 activity with ATO. The overall result revealed the protective property of polyphenol-rich apple peel extract against ATO induced cardiac toxicity via its antioxidant activity.","['Vineetha, Vadavanath Prabhakaran', 'Girija, Seetharaman', 'Soumya, Rema Sreenivasan', 'Raghu, Kozhiparambil Gopalan']","['Vineetha VP', 'Girija S', 'Soumya RS', 'Raghu KG']","['Agroprocessing and Natural Products Division, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (CSIR - NIIST), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala 695019, India. raghukgopal2009@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Fruit/*chemistry', 'Malus/*chemistry', 'Myoblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Polyphenols/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/10/21 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c3fo60470e [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2014 Mar;5(3):502-11. doi: 10.1039/c3fo60470e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fiber biosensor presented in this study utilizes an in-fiber 12 degrees tilted Bragg grating to excite a strong evanescent field on the surface of the sensor over a large range of external medium refractive indices. The devices have minimal cross-sensitivity to temperature and their fabrication does not impact the structural integrity of the fiber and its surface functionalization. Human acute leukemia cells with different intracellular densities and refractive index (RI) ranging from 1.3342 to 1.3344 were clearly discriminated in-situ by using the differential transmission spectrum between two orthogonal polarizations for the last guided mode resonance before ""cut-off"", with an amplitude variation sensitivity of 1.8 x 10(4) dB/RIU, a wavelength shift sensitivity of 180 nm/RIU, and a limit of detection of 2 x 10(-5)RIU. The detection process was precisely controlled with a micro-fluidic chip which allows the measurement of nL-volumes of bio-samples. The proposed in-fiber polarimetric biosensor is an appealing solution for rapid, sub-microliter dose and highly sensitive detection of analytes at low concentrations in medicine, chemical and environmental monitoring.","['Guo, Tuan', 'Liu, Fu', 'Liu, Yu', 'Chen, Nan-Kuang', 'Guan, Bai-Ou', 'Albert, Jacques']","['Guo T', 'Liu F', 'Liu Y', 'Chen NK', 'Guan BO', 'Albert J']","['Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical School, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, National United University, Miaoli 360, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.

In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), this is best exemplified by the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1. No other mutation in MPN has thus far shown a similar degree of diagnostic accuracy or therapeutic relevance. However, JAK2 and KIT mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with polycythemia vera and systemic mastocytosis, respectively, and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal markers in these diseases. JAK2 and MPL mutations also occur in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), but their diagnostic value is limited by suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. The molecular diagnostic gap in JAK2/MPL-unmutated ET/PMF is now partially addressed by the recent discovery of calreticulin (CALR) mutations in the majority of such cases. However, bone marrow morphology remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from prefibrotic PMF and diagnosing patients those do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR (triple-negative). The year 2013 was also marked by the description of CSF3R mutations in the majority of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). Herein, we argue for the inclusion of CALR and CSF3R mutations in the World Health Organization classification system for ET/PMF and CNL, respectively.","['Tefferi, A', 'Thiele, J', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Barbui, T']","['Tefferi A', 'Thiele J', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Research Foundation, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140120,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Calreticulin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/diagnosis/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/genetics', 'World Health Organization']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201435 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.35 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1407-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.35.

We now report 5-year outcomes of imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy in 91 children (1-21 years) with and without allogeneic BMT (N=91). We explore the impacts of additional chromosomal abnormalities and minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry on outcomes. The 5-year disease-free survival was similar for Cohort 5 patients, treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib (70%+/-12%, n=28), sibling donor BMT patients (65%+/-11%, n=21) and unrelated donor BMT patients (59+/-15%; P=0.60, n=13). Patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities had worse outcomes (P=0.05). End induction (pre-imatinib) MRD was not prognostic for Cohort 5 or allogeneic BMT patients, although limited by small numbers. The re-induction rate following relapse was similar to other higher-risk ALL groups. Longer-term follow-up confirms our initial observation of substantially good outcomes for children and adolescents with Ph+ ALL treated with imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy with no advantage for allogeneic BMT.","['Schultz, K R', 'Carroll, A', 'Heerema, N A', 'Bowman, W P', 'Aledo, A', 'Slayton, W B', 'Sather, H', 'Devidas, M', 'Zheng, H W', 'Davies, S M', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Trigg, M', 'Rutledge, R', 'Jorstad, D', 'Winick, N', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Hunger, S P', 'Carroll, W L', 'Camitta, B']","['Schultz KR', 'Carroll A', 'Heerema NA', 'Bowman WP', 'Aledo A', 'Slayton WB', 'Sather H', 'Devidas M', 'Zheng HW', 'Davies SM', 'Gaynon PS', 'Trigg M', 'Rutledge R', 'Jorstad D', 'Winick N', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Camitta B']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT British Columbia's Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham AL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Cook Children's Medical Center, Hematology/Oncology Fort Worth, TX, USA."", ""Phyllis and David Komansky Center for Children's Health/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Preventative Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group Statistics & Data Center, and the University of Florida, Department of Biostatistics, Gainesville, FL, USA."", ""Ped.

Our objective was to define the prevalence and risk factors of MGUS in a large cohort representative of the US population. Stored serum samples from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) III or NHANES 1999-2004 were available for 12,482 individuals of age 50 years (2331 'blacks', 2475 Hispanics, 7051 'whites' and 625 'others') on which agarose-gel electrophoresis, serum protein immunofixation, serum-free light-chain assay and M-protein typing were performed. MGUS was identified in 365 participants (2.4%). Adjusted prevalence of MGUS was significantly higher (P<0.001) in blacks (3.7%) compared with whites (2.3%) (P=0.001) or Hispanics (1.8%), as were characteristics that posed a greater risk of progression to MM. The adjusted prevalence of MGUS was 3.1% and 2.1% for the North/Midwest versus South/West regions of the United States, respectively (P=0.052). MGUS is significantly more common in blacks, and more often has features associated with higher risk of progression to MM. A strong geographic disparity in the prevalence of MGUS between the North/Midwest versus the South/West regions of the United States was found, which has etiologic implications.","['Landgren, O', 'Graubard, B I', 'Katzmann, J A', 'Kyle, R A', 'Ahmadizadeh, I', 'Clark, R', 'Kumar, S K', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Greenberg, A J', 'Therneau, T M', 'Melton, L J 3rd', 'Caporaso, N', 'Korde, N', 'Roschewski, M', 'Costello, R', 'McQuillan, G M', 'Rajkumar, S V']","['Landgren O', 'Graubard BI', 'Katzmann JA', 'Kyle RA', 'Ahmadizadeh I', 'Clark R', 'Kumar SK', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Greenberg AJ', 'Therneau TM', 'Melton LJ 3rd', 'Caporaso N', 'Korde N', 'Roschewski M', 'Costello R', 'McQuillan GM', 'Rajkumar SV']","['Multiple Myeloma Section, Center for Cancer Research, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Divsion of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Biostatistics Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, Center for Cancer Research, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divsion of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Biostatistics Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, Center for Cancer Research, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, Center for Cancer Research, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, Center for Cancer Research, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, Hyattsville, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140120,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/epidemiology', 'Paraproteinemias/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC4090286,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201434 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.34 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1537-42. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.34.

We used high density genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling to reveal acquired cryptic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia. By genome-wide genotyping of 137 cases of primary acute myeloid leukemia, we disclosed a recurrent focal amplification on chromosome 14q32, which included the genes BCL11B, CCNK, C14orf177 and SETD3, in two cases. In the affected cases, the BCL11B gene showed consistently high mRNA expression, whereas the expression of the other genes was unperturbed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on 40 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with high BCL11B mRNA expression [2.5-fold above median; 40 out of 530 cases (7.5%)] revealed 14q32 abnormalities in two additional cases. In the four BCL11B-rearranged cases the 14q32 locus was fused to different partner chromosomes. In fact, in two cases, we demonstrated that the focal 14q32 amplifications were integrated into transcriptionally active loci. The translocations involving BCL11B result in increased expression of full-length BCL11B protein. The BCL11B-rearranged acute myeloid leukemias expressed both myeloid and T-cell markers. These biphenotypic acute leukemias all carried FLT3 internal tandem duplications, a characteristic marker of acute myeloid leukemia. BCL11B mRNA expression in acute myeloid leukemia appeared to be strongly associated with expression of other T-cell-specific genes. Myeloid 32D(GCSF-R) cells ectopically expressing Bcl11b showed decreased proliferation rate and less maturation.

This international multicenter study presents the clinical and genetic characteristics of 62 pediatric patients with t(6;9)/DEK-NUP214-rearranged myeloid leukemia; 54 diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukemia, representing <1% of all childhood acute myeloid leukemia, and eight as having myelodysplastic syndrome. The t(6;9)/DEK-NUP214 was associated with relatively late onset (median age 10.4 years), male predominance (sex ratio 1.7), French-American-British M2 classification (54%), myelodysplasia (100%), and FLT3-ITD (42%). Outcome was substantially better than previously reported with a 5-year event-free survival of 32%, 5-year overall survival of 53%, and a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 57%. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission improved the 5-year event-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone (68% versus 18%; P<0.01) but not the overall survival (68% versus 54%; P=0.48). The presence of FLT3-ITD had a non-significant negative effect on 5-year overall survival compared with non-mutated cases (22% versus 62%; P=0.13). Gene expression profiling showed a unique signature characterized by significantly higher expression of EYA3, SESN1, PRDM2/RIZ, and HIST2H4 genes. In conclusion, t(6;9)/DEK-NUP214 represents a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with a high risk of relapse, high frequency of FLT3-ITD, and a specific gene expression signature.","['Sandahl, Julie Damgaard', 'Coenen, Eva A', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Kerndrup, Gitte', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Chilton, Lucy', 'Fornerod, Maarten', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Perot, Christine', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Reinhardt, Katarina', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Sandahl JD', 'Coenen EA', 'Forestier E', 'Harbott J', 'Johansson B', 'Kerndrup G', 'Adachi S', 'Auvrignon A', 'Beverloo HB', 'Cayuela JM', 'Chilton L', 'Fornerod M', 'de Haas V', 'Harrison CJ', 'Inaba H', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Liang DC', 'Locatelli F', 'Masetti R', 'Perot C', 'Raimondi SC', 'Reinhardt K', 'Tomizawa D', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Zecca M', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Hasle H']",['hasle@dadlnet.dk.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140117,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Recurrence', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4008104,2014/01/21 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.098517 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.098517 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 May;99(5):865-72. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.098517.

Based on the hypothesis that clofarabine inhibits DNA repair after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, we designed a phase I and extension study to evaluate the combination of clofarabine and cyclophosphamide in adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. METHODS: The continual reassessment method (CRM) was used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). RESULTS: Fifty patients with a median age of 30 years (range, 21-72 years) were enrolled, 30 of whom were part of the phase I group. Clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 3 days and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) intravenously every 12 hours x 3 days were established as the MTDs. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) included diarrhea, transaminase elevations, and skin rashes. The response rate of the whole study group was 14%, including 10% of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (CRp). Three responses occurred in patients with primary refractory disease. Early mortality (< 30 days) was 6%. The median duration of response was 69 days (range, 5-315 days). Median overall survival was about 3 months. Compared with day 1 (cyclophosphamide alone), H2AX phosphorylation was increased on day 2 when clofarabine and cyclophosphamide were administered as a couplet (n = 8). CONCLUSION: The combination of clofarabine plus cyclophosphamide at the doses used in this study in a group of heavily pretreated patients with ALL is only moderately effective. Other doses, alternative schedules, or a more favorable patient population may achieve better results.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Burger, Jan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Feliu, Jennie', 'Plunkett, William', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Thomas DA', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Burger J', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kadia T', 'Feliu J', 'Plunkett W', 'Gandhi V', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Division of Leukemia, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ.

However, post-HCT relapse remains a major problem, particularly in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. In this prospective phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of treosulfan, fludarabine, and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) as conditioning for allogeneic HCT in patients with MDS or AML. Ninety-six patients with MDS (n = 36: 15 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 10 refractory anemia with excess blasts type 1, 10 refractory anemia with excess blasts type 2, 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 1) or AML (n = 60: 35 first complete remission [CR], 18 second CR, 3 advanced CR, 4 refractory relapse) were enrolled; median age was 51 (range, 1 to 60) years. Twelve patients had undergone a prior HCT with high-intensity conditioning. Patients received 14 g/m(2)/day treosulfan i.v. on days -6 to -4, 30 mg/m(2)/day fludarabine i.v. on days -6 to -2, and 2 Gy TBI on day 0, followed by infusion of hematopoietic cells from related (n = 27) or unrelated (n = 69) donors. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate. With a median follow-up of 30 months, the 2-year overall survival (OS), relapse incidence, and nonrelapse mortality were 73%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. The incidences of grades II to IV (III to IV) acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 59% (10%) and 47%, respectively. Two-year OS was not significantly different between MDS patients with poor-risk and good/intermediate-risk cytogenetics (69% and 85%, respectively) or between AML patients with unfavorable and favorable/intermediate-risk cytogenetics (64% and 76%, respectively). In AML patients, minimal residual disease (MRD; n = 10) at the time of HCT predicted higher relapse incidence (70% versus 18%) and lower OS (41% versus 79%) at 2 years, when compared with patients without MRD. In conclusion, treosulfan, fludarabine, and low-dose TBI provided effective conditioning for allogeneic HCT in patients with MDS or AML and resulted in low relapse incidence, regardless of cytogenetic risk. In patients with AML, MRD at the time of HCT remained a risk factor for post-HCT relapse.","['Gyurkocza, Boglarka', 'Gutman, Jonathan', 'Nemecek, Eneida R', 'Bar, Merav', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Ramakrishnan, Aravind', 'Scott, Bart', 'Fang, Min', 'Wood, Brent', 'Pagel, John M', 'Baumgart, Joachim', 'Delaney, Colleen', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Deeg, Hans Joachim']","['Gyurkocza B', 'Gutman J', 'Nemecek ER', 'Bar M', 'Milano F', 'Ramakrishnan A', 'Scott B', 'Fang M', 'Wood B', 'Pagel JM', 'Baumgart J', 'Delaney C', 'Maziarz RT', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Estey EH', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storer BE', 'Deeg HJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.

The aim of the present study was to optimize the dose, period and time of cumulative benzene exposure of Swiss Albino mice and to analyze survival rate; alteration in cell cycle regulation and other clinical manifestations in mice exposed to benzene vapour at a dose 300 ppm x 6 h/day x 5 days/week for 2 weeks, i.e., 9000(a)ppm cumulative dose. Analyzing physiological parameters like plasma enzyme profile, complete hematology (Hb %, RBC indices and WBC differentials), hematopoietic cells morphology, expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, tissue histology and analysis of DNA fragmentation, optimum conditions were established. Down regulation of p53 and p21 and up regulation of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1 and E in this exposed group were marked as the optimum conditions of cellular deregulation for the development of secondary AML. Elevated level of Plasma AST/ALT with corresponding changes in liver histology showing extended sinusoids within the hepatocytic cell cords in optimally exposed animals also confirmed the toxicokinetic relation of benzene with leukemia. It can be concluded from the above observations that the 9000(a)ppm exposed animals can serve as the induced laboratory model of secondary acute myeloid leukemia.","['Mukhopadhyay, Manas Kumar', 'Nath, Debjani']","['Mukhopadhyay MK', 'Nath D']","['Cytogenetics & Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Kalyani, Kalyani 741235, Nadia, West Bengal, India.', 'Cytogenetics & Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Kalyani, Kalyani 741235, Nadia, West Bengal, India.

To answer this crucial question we have generated transgenic mice that express IDH2(R140Q) in an on/off- and tissue-specific manner using a tetracycline-inducible system. We found that IDH2(R140Q) can cooperate with overexpression of HoxA9 and Meis1a and with mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) to drive acute leukemia in vivo. Critically, we show that genetic deinduction of mutant IDH2 in leukemic cells in vivo has profound effects on their growth and/or maintenance.

However, the role of TOPK in inflammatory response remains elusive. Here we show that TOPK positively regulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In TOPK-depleted cells, the iNOS expression was shown to be greatly abolished. Also, we revealed that LPS treatment augmented the expression and activity of TOPK, the interaction of TOPK with IkappaBalpha, and promoted TOPK kinase activity against IkappaBalpha. Moreover, NF-kappaB or iNOS promoter-driven transcriptional activity in response to LPS was markedly reduced by knocking down of TOPK or deletion of NF-kappaB sites. On the other hand, endogenous TOPK level was expressed very lowly in bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) prepared from Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice, compared to BMDM from wild type (WT) mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TOPK upregulates iNOS gene expression in T cell leukemia Jurkat cells or macrophage leukemic Raw 264.7 cells via NF-kappaB activation in response to LPS, and might act as a critical effector in LPS/TLR4-mediated signaling cascade, suggesting a possible role of TOPK in inflammatory response or inflammation-related diseases.","['Park, Jung-Hwan', 'Jeong, Yu-Jin', 'Won, Hee Kwan', 'Choi, Sang-Yun', 'Park, Jong-Hwan', 'Oh, Sang-Muk']","['Park JH', 'Jeong YJ', 'Won HK', 'Choi SY', 'Park JH', 'Oh SM']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon 302-718, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon 302-718, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Konyang Hospital, Daejeon 302-718, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon 302-718, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon 302-718, Republic of Korea.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been long thought to permeate biological membranes by simple diffusion since recent evidence challenged this notion disclosing the role of aquaporin water channels (AQP) in mediating H2O2 transport across plasma membranes. We previously demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox)-generated ROS sustain glucose uptake and cellular proliferation in leukaemia cells. The aim of this study was to assess whether specific AQP isoforms can channel Nox-produced H2O2 across the plasma membrane of leukaemia cells affecting downstream pathways linked to cell proliferation. In this work, we demonstrate that AQP inhibition caused a decrease in intracellular ROS accumulation in leukaemia cells both when H2O2 was produced by Nox enzymes and when it was exogenously added. Furthermore, AQP8 overexpression or silencing resulted to modulate VEGF capacity of triggering an H2O2 intracellular level increase or decrease, respectively. Finally, we report that AQP8 is capable of increasing H2O2-induced phosphorylation of both PI3K and p38 MAPK and that AQP8 expression affected positively cell proliferation. Taken together, the results here reported indicate that AQP8 is able to modulate H2O2 transport through the plasma membrane affecting redox signalling linked to leukaemia cell proliferation.","['Vieceli Dalla Sega, Francesco', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Fiorentini, Diana', 'Rizzo, Benedetta', 'Caliceti, Cristiana', 'Landi, Laura', 'Hrelia, Silvana', 'Prata, Cecilia']","['Vieceli Dalla Sega F', 'Zambonin L', 'Fiorentini D', 'Rizzo B', 'Caliceti C', 'Landi L', 'Hrelia S', 'Prata C']","['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Italy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients treated with TM-alpha from May 2008 to April 2010 in Japan were included. Information about baseline characteristics, safety, and efficacy were collected. The DIC resolution rate, survival rate on Day 28 after the last TM-alpha administration, and changes in DIC score and coagulation tests were evaluated. RESULTS: The underlying diseases associated with DIC were acute myeloid leukemia (except for acute promyelocytic leukemia, n=350), lymphoma (n=199), acute promyelocytic leukemia (n=172), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=156), myelodysplastic syndromes (n=61), and other (n=94). The incidence rates of bleeding-related adverse events and adverse drug reactions were 17.8% and 4.6%, respectively. In subjects with bleeding symptoms at baseline, 55.0% were assessed as disappeared or improved based on symptoms after TM-alpha treatment. The DIC resolution and survival rates were 55.9% and 70.7%, respectively. The DIC score and coagulation tests including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were significantly improved. Coagulation tests were significantly improved after TM-alpha treatment even in subjects whose clinical course of underlying disease was assessed as unchanged or exacerbated. CONCLUSIONS: This surveillance confirmed the safety and efficacy of TM-alpha in clinical practice, thus TM-alpha may be an ideal treatment for patients with DIC based upon hematologic malignancy.","['Asakura, Hidesaku', 'Takahashi, Hoyu', 'Tsuji, Hajime', 'Matsushita, Tadashi', 'Ninomiya, Hideyuki', 'Honda, Goichi', 'Mimuro, Jun', 'Eguchi, Yutaka', 'Kitajima, Isao', 'Sakata, Yoichi']","['Asakura H', 'Takahashi H', 'Tsuji H', 'Matsushita T', 'Ninomiya H', 'Honda G', 'Mimuro J', 'Eguchi Y', 'Kitajima I', 'Sakata Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine (III), Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan.

As some patients are not enrolled in these trials due to early severe events, these results might be overestimated. To address this issue, we reviewed all APL patients referred to the Hospital Saint-Louis within the 2000-2010 period, with a special focus on inclusion in recruiting trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients (including eight children) with newly diagnosed APL were admitted during this period, which covered two consecutive APL trials conducted by the French-Belgian-Swiss APL group. RESULTS: The rate of patients not enrolled within recruiting trials was 29%. The main reason for non-inclusion was protocol ineligibility related to disease severity at diagnosis. Non-enrolled patients more frequently had white blood cell count (WBC) . or =50x10(9)/L (31% versus 8%; p=.01), platelet count<40x10(9)/L (97% versus 65%; p=.001) and microgranular variant APL (38% versus 11%; p=.004) and were more frequently admitted in intensive care unit during induction (41% versus 24%; p=.094). Early mortality rate was higher in non-enrolled patients (21% versus 3%; p=.007), translating into a lower complete remission rate (79% versus 96%; p=.007) and lower event-free survival (65% versus 84% at 5 years; p=.05), while disease-free survival was similar in both non-enrolled and enrolled patient groups (81% versus 88% at 5 years; p=.68). CONCLUSION: Initial APL severity leads to a significant proportion of patients non-registered within clinical trials, which may underestimate the real early mortality, which remained nonetheless less than 10% in this study.","['Micol, Jean Baptiste', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Lengline, Etienne', 'Canet, Emmanuel', 'Daniel, Marie Therese', 'Labarthe, Adrienne de', 'Maarek, Odile', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Azoulay, Elie', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Micol JB', 'Raffoux E', 'Boissel N', 'Lengline E', 'Canet E', 'Daniel MT', 'Labarthe Ad', 'Maarek O', 'Cassinat B', 'Ades L', 'Baruchel A', 'Degos L', 'Azoulay E', 'Dombret H']","['Department of Hematology and EA3518, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and EA3518, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and EA3518, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and EA3518, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Biology, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Avicenne (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hopital Robert Debre (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and EA3518, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and EA3518, Hopital Saint-Louis (Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.

These two opposing forces are finely orchestrated by several regulatory mechanisms, comprising both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Over the past decades, several studies have contributed to dissect the key role of niche factors, signaling transduction pathways, and transcription factors in HSC development and maintenance. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that a higher level of intrinsic regulation exists; epigenetic marks, by controlling chromatin accessibility, directly shape HSC developmental cascades, including their emergence during embryonic development, maintenance of self-renewal, lineage commitment, and aging. In addition, aberrant epigenetic marks have been found in several hematological malignancies, consistent with clinical findings that mutations targeting epigenetic regulators promote leukemogenesis. In this review, we will focus on both normal and malignant hematopoiesis, covering recent findings that illuminate the epigenetic life of HSCs.","['Cullen, Sean M', 'Mayle, Allison', 'Rossi, Lara', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Cullen SM', 'Mayle A', 'Rossi L', 'Goodell MA']","['Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

Many early trials were disappointing in large part because of the lack of proliferation and subsequent persistence of transferred cells. Recent investigations have pointed to the importance of delivering highly proliferative cells, whether of naive or early memory phenotypes. METHODS: We investigated the influence of two common cell culturing methods used in early trials and their relationship to T-cell phenotype and pre-clinical efficacy. RESULTS: We observed that stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 antibody OKT-3 and high-dose interleukin-2 produces more effector memory-type T cells with shorter average telomeres when compared with cells generated with the use of CD3/CD28 beads. When used in xenograft models of leukemia, bead-stimulated cells proliferated earlier and to a higher degree than those generated with the use of OKT-3/IL2 and resulted in better disease control despite no difference in distribution or migration throughout the mouse. Inclusion of the known successful clinical 4-1BB endodomain in the CAR could not rescue the function of OKT-3/IL-2-cultured cells. T cells isolated from animals that survived long-term (>120 days) retained a central memory-like phenotype and demonstrated a memory response to a large re-challenge of CD19-positive leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we confirm that cells with a younger phenotype or higher proliferative capacity perform better in pre-clinical models and that cell culturing influences cell phenotype seemingly independent of the 4-1BB endodomain in the CAR structure.","['Barrett, David M', 'Singh, Nathan', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Shuguang', 'June, Carl H', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Zhao, Yangbing']","['Barrett DM', 'Singh N', 'Liu X', 'Jiang S', 'June CH', 'Grupp SA', 'Zhao Y']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

To evaluate if DNA repair insufficiencies are related to methylation changes, we examined the methylation of nine promoter regions of DNA repair proteins by bisulfide sequencing in 26 CLL primary samples and performed quantitative PCR on a subset of samples to examine BRCA1 expression. We also investigated if changes in cytogenetic or expression level of DNA repair proteins led to changes in sensitivity to a novel PARP inhibitor, CEP-8983, alone and in combination with bendamustine. No changes in promoter methylation were identified in BRCA1, BRCA2, FANC-C, FANC-F, FANC-L, ATM, MGMT, hMLH1 and H2AX except for two cases of minor BRCA1 hypermethylation. CLL samples appeared to have reduced BRCA1 mRNA expression uniformly in comparison to non-malignant lymphocytes irrespective of promoter hypermethylation. CEP-8983 displayed single agent cytotoxicity and the combination with bendamustine demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in the majority of CLL samples. These results were consistent across cytogenetic subgroups, including 17p deleted and previously treated patients.

We aimed to explore the correlation between induction therapy response, outcome, and the PBB percentage. METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients with de novo AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) were enrolled in this study. Flow cytometry was performed to identify cells with a leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype in the initial bone marrow aspirate and in peripheral blood on day 7 of induction therapy. RESULTS: The PBB percentage on day 7 (D7PBBP) was significantly lower in patients who achieved CR (0.03% (0.0%, 0.45%)) than in those who did not (10.85% (1.13%, 19.38%); u = -3.92, P < 0.001). The CR rate was significantly higher among patients with a D7PBBP of <0.945% (84.62%, 22/26) than among those with a D7PBBP of = 0.945% (25.0%, 5/20; chi2 = 16.571, P < 0.001).

However, MLL-PTD in relatives of patients with MLL-PTD has not been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of MLL-PTD in patients with acute leukemia and in their relatives. METHODS: The bone marrow or peripheral blood was collected from patients with acute leukaemia and their relatives. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to detect the mRNA expression of the MLLPTD fused gene, and further confirm in genomic DNA level. RESULTS: Analysing MLL-PTD in case 1, the patient's older brother and his younger brother were positive, while his mother and his son were negative. The exon type in case 1 was e9/3 fusion, but in his older brother, it was e9/3 and e11/3 fusion, and in his younger brother, it was e9/3, e10/3, and e11/3 fusion. MLL-PTD in case 2 was negative, but in the patient's older sister was positive, and the exon type was e9/3, e10/3, and e11/3. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of MLL-PTD was present in cases with acute leukaemia with a single expression type. However, various expression types were detected in their healthy relatives. MLL-PTD can couple with other chromosome aberrations, and its impact on disease prognosis remains to be studied further.","['He, Yi', 'Wang, Dongning', 'Li, Xudong', 'Hu, Yuan', 'Wang, Wenwen', 'Huang, Renwei']","['He Y', 'Wang D', 'Li X', 'Hu Y', 'Wang W', 'Huang R']","['Department of Haematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Guangdong 510630, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Guangdong 510630, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Guangdong 510630, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Guangdong 510630, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Guangdong 510630, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Guangdong 510630, China.

All samples were evaluated in vitro for anticancer activity against nine human cancer lines: K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast), NCI/ADR-RES (resistant ovarian cancer), NCI-H460 (lung), UACC-62 (melanoma), PC-3 (prostate), HT-29 (colon), OVCAR-3 (ovarian) and 786-0 (kidney). Psidium guajava's active compounds displayed similar physicochemical properties to estradiol and tamoxifen, as in silico molecular docking studies demonstrated that they fit into the estrogen receptors (ERs). The meroterpene-enriched fraction was also evaluated in vivo in a Solid Ehrlich murine breast adenocarcinoma model, and showed to be highly effective in inhibiting tumor growth, also demonstrating uterus increase in comparison to negative controls. The ability of guajadial, psidial A and psiguadials A and B to reduce tumor growth and stimulate uterus proliferation, as well as their in silico docking similarity to tamoxifen, suggest that these compounds may act as Selective Estrogen Receptors Modulators (SERMs), therefore holding significant potential for anticancer therapy.","['Rizzo, L Y', 'Longato, G B', 'Ruiz, A Lt G', 'Tinti, S V', 'Possenti, A', 'Vendramini-Costa, D B', 'Sartoratto, A', 'Figueira, G M', 'Silva, F L N', 'Eberlin, M N', 'Souza, T A C B', 'Murakami, M T', 'Rizzo, E', 'Foglio, M A', 'Kiessling, F', 'Lammers, T', 'Carvalho, J E']","['Rizzo LY', 'Longato GB', 'Ruiz AL', 'Tinti SV', 'Possenti A', 'Vendramini-Costa DB', 'Sartoratto A', 'Figueira GM', 'Silva FL', 'Eberlin MN', 'Souza TA', 'Murakami MT', 'Rizzo E', 'Foglio MA', 'Kiessling F', 'Lammers T', 'Carvalho JE']","['Department of Experimental Molecular Imaging (ExMI), RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 20, 52074, Aachen, Germany. lyokotarizzo@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Estrogens', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Psidium/*chemistry', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-58715 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867321666140120120031 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2014;21(20):2322-30. doi: 10.2174/0929867321666140120120031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a retrospective study to determine the frequency and risk factors associated with VZV reactivation, including underlying disease, the use of fludarabine in high-risk leukemia chemotherapy protocols, and immune status before HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 163 children who underwent a first HSCT between 2002 and 2008, before introduction of routine VZV prophylaxis on our unit. VZV diagnosis was based on clinical features and supported by polymerase chain reaction on plasma and/or vesical fluid. Patient data and possible risk factors pre- and post HSCT were recorded and compared using a multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Within this cohort, 41 (25%) patients developed VZV reactivation during the first year after transplantation at a median of 60 days post HSCT. VZV reactivation occurred more often within the subgroup of patients with acute leukemia compared with the remainder of patients (38% vs. 15%, P < 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that, besides positive VZV serology in patients pre-HSCT (P = 0.03), acute leukemia as the indication for HSCT remained the only independent risk factor for VZV reactivation (P = 0.025, odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6). This was associated with low pre-transplant T-cell counts, especially in the CD4(+) subset. No differences were found in relation to donor type, age, or use of serotherapy. CONCLUSION: VZV reactivation after HSCT predominates in acute leukemia patients and is associated with low T CD4(+) lymphocyte counts. This finding demonstrates the impact of pre-HSCT host immune suppression on VZV reactivation patterns after HSCT.","['Vermont, C L', 'Jol-van der Zijde, E C M', 'Hissink Muller, P', 'Ball, L M', 'Bredius, R G M', 'Vossen, A C', 'Lankester, A C']","['Vermont CL', 'Jol-van der Zijde EC', 'Hissink Muller P', 'Ball LM', 'Bredius RG', 'Vossen AC', 'Lankester AC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140120,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Virus Activation/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2015/01/22 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12180 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2014 Apr;16(2):188-94. doi: 10.1111/tid.12180.

Although ultrasound and FNA have been explored for individual neoplasms, lymph node involvement, and metastases, their use in day-to-day dermatology is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use and utility of ultrasound and FNA in the dermatologic surgery division of a large academic institution. METHODS: Retrospective case review of all ultrasound and FNA procedures ordered by a dermatologic surgeon over a 3-year period. RESULTS: Metastatic disease was suspected in 11 of 21 (52.4%) cases. Cytology confirmed the presence of metastatic disease in two of the 11 cases, and metastatic disease was identified in one additional case in which the diagnosis was not suspected at clinical presentation. Cytology revealed leukemia or lymphoma in three (14.3%) cases, two of which were new diagnoses. Sonographic imaging and cytology revealed a benign diagnosis in 16 (76.2%) cases, five of which were reactive lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ultrasound and FNA are underused techniques that may play an important role in dermatology diagnostics and have the potential for expansion in day-to-day clinical practice.","['Wolz, Michael M', 'Goss, Brian C', 'Baum, Christian L', 'Arpey, Christopher J']","['Wolz MM', 'Goss BC', 'Baum CL', 'Arpey CJ']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140118,United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,,IM,"['*Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Dermatology/*instrumentation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', '*Ultrasonography']",,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/04/25 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/dsu.12430 [doi]'],ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 2014 Mar;40(3):275-80. doi: 10.1111/dsu.12430.

Uncommonly, EBV can infect T or natural killer (NK) cells in a person with a defect in innate immunity, and EBV infection can cause unique systemic lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) of childhood. Primary infection in young children can be complicated by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or fulminant systemic T-cell LPD of childhood. Uncommonly, patients can develop chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease-type T/NK LPD, which includes CAEBV infection of the systemic form, hydroa vacciniforme-like T-cell LPD, and mosquito-bite hypersensitivity. The clinical course of CAEBV disease-type T/NK LPD can be smoldering, persistent or progressive, depending on the balance between viral factors and host immunity. Aggressive NK-cell leukemia, hydroa vacciniforme-like T-cell lymphoma, or uncommonly extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma can develop in children and young adults with CAEBV disease-type T/NK-cell LPD. Extranodal T/NK-cell lymphoma is a disease of adults, and its incidence begins to increase in the third decade and comprises the major subtype of T/NK LPD throughout life. Aggressive NK-cell leukemia and nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma of the elderly are fulminant diseases, and immune senescence may be an important pathogenetic factor.

Experimental therapy with CAR-engineered T cells has also shown promising results on solid tumors. The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is a protein expressed on the surface of prostate epithelial cells as well as in primary and metastatic prostate cancer cells and therefore a promising target for immunotherapy of prostate cancer. METHODS: We developed a third-generation CAR against PSCA including the CD28, OX-40 and CD3 zeta signaling domains. T cells were transduced with a lentivirus encoding the PSCA-CAR and evaluated for cytokine production (paired Student's t-test), proliferation (paired Student's t-test), CD107a expression (paired Student's t-test) and target cell killing in vitro and tumor growth and survival in vivo (Log-rank test comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves). RESULTS: PSCA-CAR T cells exhibit specific interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 secretion and specific proliferation in response to PSCA-expressing target cells. Furthermore, the PSCA-CAR-engineered T cells efficiently kill PSCA-expressing tumor cells in vitro and systemic treatment with PSCA-CAR-engineered T cells significantly delays subcutaneous tumor growth and prolongs survival of mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirms that PSCA-CAR T cells may be developed for treatment of prostate cancer.","['Hillerdal, Victoria', 'Ramachandran, Mohanraj', 'Leja, Justyna', 'Essand, Magnus']","['Hillerdal V', 'Ramachandran M', 'Leja J', 'Essand M']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden. magnus.essand@igp.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140118,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PSCA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/immunology', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden']",PMC3899402,2014/01/21 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-30 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jan 18;14:30. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first techniques that have been developed allowed 'gross' chromosomal abnormalities to be identified. They include conventional and molecular cytogenetics and microarray-based techniques. However, these techniques can only reveal part of the problem, as genes can be altered in a number of ways (mutations, methylation and so on). This led to the development of what is now known as next-generation sequencing (NGS). Each method has advantages and limits.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nine women with APL were treated in 1998-2013. When APL was diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy, the latter was terminated (n = 1); when its diagnosis was made in the second trimester, chemotherapy (CT) followed by delivery (D) was performed (n = 3); when it was done in the third trimester, D followed by CT was done in relation to gestational age (n = 2) or these were performed at a later gestational age (n = 1). APL was treated in 5 and 1 patients according to the AIDA protocol and the 7+3 plus ATRA one, respectively. RESULTS: All the patients with APL achieved remission after the first cycle of induction CT; 5 of the 6 patients did at the moment of delivery; one patient underwent emergency delivery during cytopenia after the cycle. The gestational age at delivery after CT was 34 (34-40) weeks. Spontaneous term labor occurred in 2 patients at an obstetric hospital. Cesarean section was made in 4 of the 6 patients.

We evaluated the efficacy of SET antagonism in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, a murine leukemia model, and primary patient samples using OP449, a specific, cell-penetrating peptide that antagonizes SET's inhibition of PP2A. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro cytotoxicity and specificity of OP449 in CML and AML cell lines and primary samples were measured using proliferation, apoptosis, and clonogenic assays. Efficacy of target inhibition by OP449 was evaluated by immunoblotting and PP2A assay. In vivo antitumor efficacy of OP449 was measured in human HL-60 xenografted murine model. RESULTS: We observed that OP449 inhibited growth of CML cells including those from patients with blastic phase disease and patients harboring highly drug-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations. Combined treatment with OP449 and ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly more cytotoxic to K562 cells and primary CD34(+) CML cells. SET protein levels remained unchanged with OP449 treatment, but BCR-ABL1-mediated downstream signaling was significantly inhibited with the degradation of key signaling molecules such as BCR-ABL1, STAT5, and AKT. Similarly, AML cell lines and primary patient samples with various genetic lesions showed inhibition of cell growth after treatment with OP449 alone or in combination with respective kinase inhibitors. Finally, OP449 reduced the tumor burden of mice xenografted with human leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a novel therapeutic paradigm of SET antagonism using OP449 in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CML and AML.","['Agarwal, Anupriya', 'MacKenzie, Ryan J', 'Pippa, Raffaella', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Oddo, Jessica', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Sears, Rosalie', 'Vitek, Michael P', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Christensen, Dale J', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Agarwal A', 'MacKenzie RJ', 'Pippa R', 'Eide CA', 'Oddo J', 'Tyner JW', 'Sears R', 'Vitek MP', 'Odero MD', 'Christensen DJ', 'Druker BJ']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Knight Cancer Institute; Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology; Departments of Cell and Developmental Biology and Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon; Oncotide Pharmaceuticals, Research Triangle Park; Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; and Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (OP449 peptide)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Chaperones/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3989420,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-2575 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2575 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Apr 15;20(8):2092-103. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2575.

METHODS: To determine the lineage involvement, we applied combined morphology and an interphase FISH study using dual-color break-apart probes for MYC on peripheral blood film. RESULTS: MYC amplification was demonstrated in both myeloid and monocytic cells but not lymphocytes. The MYC amplification was not associated with loss of MYC signals at the homologous 8q24 regions where the genes were located. Furthermore, the extent of MYC amplification has been shown to diminish as the granulocytes mature. CONCLUSIONS: Combined morphology and FISH study has shown a pluripotent myeloid disorder and also an inverse relationship between cell maturity and MYC amplification.","['Wong, K F', 'Siu, Lisa L P', 'Wong, W S']","['Wong KF', 'Siu LL', 'Wong WS']","['Dept of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, 30 Gascoigne Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China; kfwong@ha.org.hk.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (May-Grunwald Giemsa)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)', 'TDQ283MPCW (Eosine Yellowish-(YS))']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromatin/*genetics/pathology', 'Coloring Agents', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Methylene Blue', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/03/05 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['141/2/280 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPWUBGT7C0LHIN [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2014 Feb;141(2):280-4. doi: 10.1309/AJCPWUBGT7C0LHIN.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'Genetics', 'Hematopathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated survival trends in TYA cancer diagnosed in Northern England, 1968-2008. METHODS: Five-year survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation for four successive time periods. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate associations with demographic factors. RESULTS: The study included 2,987 cases (1,634 males, 1,353 females). Five-year survival for all patients with cancer improved greatly from 46% in 1968-1977 to 84% in 1998-2008 (P < 0.001), for patients with leukemia from 2% to 71% (P < 0.001), lymphoma from 66% to 86% (P < 0.001), central nervous system tumors from 53% to 84% (P < 0.001), bone tumors from 29% to 72% (P < 0.001), germ cell tumors from 39% to 94% (P < 0.001), melanoma and skin cancer from 64% to 100% (P < 0.001), and carcinomas from 48% to 80% (P < 0.001). Cox analysis showed that for all patients with cancer, survival was better for females than males (HR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.74-0.94, P < 0.001), for patients aged 20-24 years compared with those aged 15-19 years (HR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.75-0.94, P = 0.002), but survival was worse for patients who resided in more deprived areas (HR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.11, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: There have been large improvements in TYA cancer survival in Northern England over the last four decades. Future work should determine factors that could lead to even better survival, including possible links with delayed diagnosis.","['Basta, N O', 'James, P W', 'Gomez-Pozo, B', 'Craft, A W', 'Norman, P', 'McNally, R J Q']","['Basta NO', 'James PW', 'Gomez-Pozo B', 'Craft AW', 'Norman P', 'McNally RJ']","['Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/classification/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24939 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):901-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24939.

Clinical hypersensitivity, a common reason for treatment discontinuation, has been reported in 10-30% of patients receiving Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase. After hypersensitivity, E. coli-derived asparaginase should be discontinued and an alternative asparaginase preparation, such as asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi, may be initiated. We conducted a compassionate-use study to collect additional safety information on asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi and to support FDA approval of the product. PROCEDURE: Patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL; N = 1368) who developed a hypersensitivity reaction (grade >/=2) to an E. coli-derived asparaginase participated in this trial. The recommended asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi dose was 25,000 IU/m(2) three days per week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) for two consecutive weeks for each missed pegylated E. coli-derived asparaginase dose and 25,000 IU/m(2) for each missed nonpegylated asparaginase dose for the completion of their planned asparaginase treatment. RESULTS: Adverse event reports and/or case report forms were completed for 940 patients. The most common adverse event (AE) was hypersensitivity (13.6%). Eighteen patients (1.9%) died during the study. Most patients (77.6%) completed their planned asparaginase treatment with asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi. There was no apparent difference in the incidence of the most commonly reported AEs with asparaginase treatment by age, administration, or disease state. CONCLUSIONS: This study further established the safety profile of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi in patients with ALL or LBL who had a hypersensitivity reaction to an E. coli-derived asparaginase.","['Plourde, Paul V', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Keller, Frank G', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Mercedes, Taheri', 'Lai, Chinglin', 'Corn, Tim']","['Plourde PV', 'Jeha S', 'Hijiya N', 'Keller FG', 'Silverman LB', 'Rheingold SR', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Dahl GV', 'Mercedes T', 'Lai C', 'Corn T']","['Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, California.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bacterial Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24938 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jul;61(7):1232-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24938.

Whether a generic or tailored approach to weight management is needed for cancer survivors has yet to be tested. PROCEDURE: Thirty-eight youth 8-18 years with BMI >/= 85% who had survived ALL were recruited for a randomized clinical trial evaluating a weight management intervention (WMI) tailored for childhood ALL survivors (Fit4Life). Fit4Life recipients received a 4-month web, phone, and text message-delivered WMI tailored for cancer survivorship. Controls received a general WMI delivered via phone and mail. Assessments were performed at baseline and 4 months. Outcome data were analyzed according to assigned treatment condition over time. RESULTS: Most (80%, (70%, 100%) [median (IQR)]) of the assigned curriculum was received by Fit4Life participants as compared to 50% (40%, 65%) among controls. Fit4Life recipients >/= 14 years demonstrated less weight gain (P = 0.05) and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (P < 0.01) while all Fit4Life recipients reported reduced negative mood (P < 0.05) over time as compared to control counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated acceptable feasibility of a WMI tailored for overweight and obese children surviving ALL utilizing a multimodal technology approach. Improved weight, weight-related behavior, and psychological outcomes were demonstrated among Fit4Life intervention as compared to youth receiving a generic WMI. Data from this pilot trial may be used to design a larger trial to determine whether youth of all ages also can derive a benefit from a cancer survivor-tailored WMI and whether short-term outcomes translate into improved long-term outcomes for childhood ALL survivors.","['Huang, Jeannie S', 'Dillon, Lindsay', 'Terrones, Laura', 'Schubert, Lynn', 'Roberts, William', 'Finklestein, Jerry', 'Swartz, Maria C', 'Norman, Gregory J', 'Patrick, Kevin']","['Huang JS', 'Dillon L', 'Terrones L', 'Schubert L', 'Roberts W', 'Finklestein J', 'Swartz MC', 'Norman GJ', 'Patrick K']","[""Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, California; Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, California.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*therapy', 'Overweight/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Survivors/*psychology', '*Weight Loss']",PMC3997743,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24937 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):894-900. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24937.

DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort. SETTING: The UK's Haematological Malignancy Research Network (catchment population 3.6 million, with >2000 new haematological malignancies diagnosed annually). PARTICIPANTS: All patients newly diagnosed with CML, from September 2004 to August 2011 and followed up to 31 March 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence and survival. RESULTS: With a median diagnostic age of 59 years, the CML age standardised (European) incidence was 0.9/100 000 (95% CIs 0.8 to 0.9), 5-year overall survival was 78.9% (72.3 to 84.0) and 5-year relative survival 88.6% (81.0 to 93.3). The efficacy of treatment across all ages was clearly demonstrated; the relative survival curves for those under 60 and over 60 years being closely aligned. Survival findings were similar for men and women, but varied with deprivation; the age and sex adjusted HR being 3.43 (1.89 to 6.22) for deprivation categories 4-5 (less affluent) versus 1-3 (more affluent). None of these differences were attributable to the biological features of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: When therapy is freely provided, population-based survival for CML is similar to that reported in clinical trials, and age loses its prognostic significance. However, although most of the patients with CML now experience close to normal lifespans, those living in more deprived areas tend to have poorer outcomes, despite receiving the same clinical care. A significant improvement in overall population outcomes could be achieved if these socioeconomic differences, which may reflect the treatment compliance, could be eliminated.","['Smith, A G', 'Painter, D', 'Howell, D A', 'Evans, P', 'Smith, G', 'Patmore, R', 'Jack, A', 'Roman, E']","['Smith AG', 'Painter D', 'Howell DA', 'Evans P', 'Smith G', 'Patmore R', 'Jack A', 'Roman E']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/therapeutic use', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC3902525,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/01/18 06:01,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2013-004266 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004266 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2014 Jan 15;4(1):e004266. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004266.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Drug compliance', 'EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'Socio-economic status']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20140117']

Thus, targeting STAT5 is an appealing therapeutic strategy for hematologic malignancies. Given the importance of bromodomain-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation, we considered the hypothesis that a pharmacologic bromodomain inhibitor could inhibit STAT5-dependent gene expression. We found that the small-molecule bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 decreases STAT5-dependent (but not STAT3-dependent) transcription of both heterologous reporter genes and endogenous STAT5 target genes. JQ1 reduces STAT5 function in leukemia and lymphoma cells with constitutive STAT5 activation, or inducibly activated by cytokine stimulation. Among the BET bromodomain subfamily of proteins, it seems that BRD2 is the critical mediator for STAT5 activity. In experimental models of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias, where activated STAT5 contributes to leukemia cell survival, Brd2 knockdown or JQ1 treatment shows strong synergy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells.

Here, we demonstrate the sensitizing effects of the histone hyperacetylation-inducing pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat on human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blast progenitor cells (BPC) to the BET protein antagonist JQ1. Treatment with JQ1, but not its inactive enantiomer (R-JQ1), was highly lethal against AML BPCs expressing mutant NPM1c+ with or without coexpression of FLT3-ITD or AML expressing mixed lineage leukemia fusion oncoprotein. JQ1 treatment reduced binding of BRD4 and RNA polymerase II to the DNA of c-MYC and BCL2 and reduced their levels in the AML cells. Cotreatment with JQ1 and the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat synergistically induced apoptosis of the AML BPCs, but not of normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. This was associated with greater attenuation of c-MYC and BCL2, while increasing p21, BIM, and cleaved PARP levels in the AML BPCs. Cotreatment with JQ1 and panobinostat significantly improved the survival of the NOD/SCID mice engrafted with OCI-AML3 or MOLM13 cells (P < 0.01).

A number of PAX5 rearrangements result in the expression of in-frame fusion genes encoding chimeric proteins, which at the N-terminus consistently retain the PAX5 DNA-binding paired domain fused to the C-terminal domains of a markedly heterogeneous group of fusion partners. PAX5 fusion proteins are thought to function as aberrant transcription factors, which antagonize wild-type PAX5 activity. To gain mechanistic insight into the role of PAX5 fusion proteins in leukemogenesis, the biochemical and functional properties of uncharacterized fusions: PAX5-DACH1, PAX5-DACH2, PAX5-ETV6, PAX5-HIPK1, and PAX5-POM121 were ascertained. Independent of the subcellular distribution of the wild-type partner proteins, ectopic expression of all PAX5 fusion proteins showed a predominant nuclear localization, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation all of the chimeric proteins exhibited binding to endogenous PAX5 target sequences. Furthermore, consistent with the presence of potential oligomerization motifs provided by the partner proteins, the self-interaction capability of several fusion proteins was confirmed. Remarkably, a subset of the PAX5 fusion proteins conferred CD79A promoter activity; however, in contrast with wild-type PAX5, the fusion proteins were unable to induce Cd79a transcription in a murine plasmacytoma cell line. These data show that leukemia-associated PAX5 fusion proteins share some dominating characteristics such as nuclear localization and DNA binding but also show distinctive features. IMPLICATIONS: This comparative study of multiple PAX5 fusion proteins demonstrates both common and unique properties, which likely dictate their function and impact on leukemia development.","['Fortschegger, Klaus', 'Anderl, Stefanie', 'Denk, Dagmar', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Fortschegger K', 'Anderl S', 'Denk D', 'Strehl S']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung e.V.

We compared the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in children with acute myeloid leukemia using RIC regimens with those receiving myeloablative-conditioning (MAC) regimens. A total of 180 patients were evaluated (39 with RIC and 141 with MAC regimens). Results of univariate and multivariate analysis showed no significant differences in the rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, leukemia-free, and overall survival between treatment groups. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival with RIC and MAC regimens were 45% and 48%, respectively (P = .99). Moreover, relapse rates were not higher with RIC compared with MAC regimens (39% vs 39%; P = .95), and recipients of MAC regimens were not at higher risk for transplant-related mortality compared with recipients of RIC regimens (16% vs 16%; P = .73). After carefully controlled analyses, we found that in this relatively modest study population, the data supported a role for RIC regimens for acute myeloid leukemia in children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The data also provided justification for designing a carefully controlled randomized clinical trial that examines the efficacy of regimen intensity in this population.","['Bitan, Menachem', 'He, Wensheng', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Ayas, Mouhab Fakhreddine', 'Bielorai, Bella', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Horan, John T', 'Jodele, Sonata', 'Kitko, Carrie L', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Kletzel, Morris', 'Kasow, Kimberly A', 'Lehmann, Leslie E', 'Mehta, Parinda A', 'Shah, Nirali', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Prestidge, Tim', 'Seber, Adriana', 'Shenoy, Shalini', 'Woolfrey, Ann E', 'Yu, Lolie C', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Bitan M', 'He W', 'Zhang MJ', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Ayas MF', 'Bielorai B', 'Carpenter PA', 'Cairo MS', 'Diaz MA', 'Horan JT', 'Jodele S', 'Kitko CL', 'Schultz KR', 'Kletzel M', 'Kasow KA', 'Lehmann LE', 'Mehta PA', 'Shah N', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Prestidge T', 'Seber A', 'Shenoy S', 'Woolfrey AE', 'Yu LC', 'Davies SM']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3945869,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35936-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-535716 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 6;123(10):1615-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-535716.

Recent work in mice has identified innate memory-like properties of NK cells. Human NK cells also exhibit memory-like properties, and cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells are generated via brief preactivation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, which later exhibit enhanced functionality upon restimulation. However, the optimal cytokine receptors and signals for maintenance of enhanced function and homeostasis after preactivation remain unclear. Here, we show that IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 preactivation induces a rapid and prolonged expression of CD25, resulting in a functional high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2Ralphabetagamma) that confers responsiveness to picomolar concentrations of IL-2. The expression of CD25 correlated with STAT5 phosphorylation in response to picomolar concentrations of IL-2, indicating the presence of a signal-competent IL-2Ralphabetagamma. Furthermore, picomolar concentrations of IL-2 acted synergistically with IL-12 to costimulate IFN-gamma production by preactivated NK cells, an effect that was CD25 dependent. Picomolar concentrations of IL-2 also enhanced NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity via the IL-2Ralphabetagamma. Further, after adoptive transfer into immunodeficient NOD-SCID-gammac(-/-) mice, human cytokine-preactivated NK cells expand preferentially in response to exogenous IL-2. Collectively, these data demonstrate that human CIML NK cells respond to IL-2 via IL-2Ralphabetagamma with enhanced survival and functionality, and they provide additional rationale for immunotherapeutic strategies that include brief cytokine preactivation before adoptive NK cell transfer, followed by low-dose IL-2 therapy.","['Leong, Jeffrey W', 'Chase, Julie M', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Schneider, Stephanie E', 'Sullivan, Ryan P', 'Cooper, Megan A', 'Fehniger, Todd A']","['Leong JW', 'Chase JM', 'Romee R', 'Schneider SE', 'Sullivan RP', 'Cooper MA', 'Fehniger TA']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

The role of ATO in front-line therapy of APL is under investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Pilot studies using ATO with or without all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been carried out in newly diagnosed APL patients with the aim to reduce the short and long-term toxic effects of chemotherapy and to improve clinical outcome. Especially in patients with non-high-risk APL, the ATRA + ATO approach allowed significant increase in event-free survival and overall survival rates compared to standard ATRA and chemotherapy. This has been demonstrated by pilot studies and, more recently, by a randomized comparative multi-centre study conducted in Italy and Germany. SUMMARY: The ATO + ATRA strategy for APL may provide the first paradigm of acute leukaemia curability by targeted agents and without chemotherapy. However, longer follow-up of available studies and independent confirmation of the Italian-German findings are awaited to firmly establish this paradigm. Finally, extension of this approach to other patient categories such as high-risk, elderly and children will need to be explored in the near future.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Breccia M', 'Cicconi L', 'Lo-Coco F']","['aDepartment of Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome bDepartment of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata cLaboratory of Neuro-Oncohematology, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Standard of Care', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000023 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):95-101. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated whether SFRP5 gene methylation causes multidrug resistance (MDR) in leukemia through the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling, leading to the upregulation of the mdr1 gene and its product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Methylation-specific PCR identified SFRP5 gene methylation in cultured bone mononuclear cells from 7/12 patients with acute leukemia and in four human leukemia cell lines (HL-60, Raji, U937 and KG1a). Western blotting revealed absent SFRP5 protein expression in cells from 5/7 patients with SFRP5 gene methylation and in all cell lines. Treatment with a demethylation agent (DAC) rescued SFRP5 expression. mdr1 mRNA and P-gp protein were detected in cells from 3/5 patients with absent SFRP5, and in the KG1a cell line; these cells also had the highest levels of activated ss-catenin. In cells from these three patients, DAC rescued SFRP5 expression and downregulated mdr1 and P-gp. SFRP5 protein expression was rescued in transgenic KG1a/SFRP5 cells, compared with KG1a/eGFP or untransfected KG1a cells. mdr1 and P-gp in KG1a/SFRP5 cells were downregulated. Doxorubicin IC50 values were significantly lower in KG1a/SFRP5 (0.573+/-0.131 muM) than in KG1a (0.963+/-0.115) or KG1a/eGFP (0.917+/-0.138) cells (P<0.05). We conclude that SFRP5 gene methylation in leukemia cells activates Wnt/ss-catenin signaling to upregulate mdr1/P-gp expression and cause MDR. Recovery of SFRP5 expression reversed MDR in the KG1a leukemia cell line. Our results suggest that modulating SFRP5 methylation could decrease MDR in leukemia patients.","['Wang, H', 'Wang, X', 'Hu, R', 'Yang, W', 'Liao, A', 'Zhao, C', 'Zhang, J', 'Liu, Z']","['Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Hu R', 'Yang W', 'Liao A', 'Zhao C', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital affiliated to China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140117,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SFRP5 protein, human)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201387 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2013.87 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2014 Feb;21(2):83-9. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2013.87.

However, the molecular mechanism behind the antileukemic activity of AT-101 has not been well characterized. In this study, we investigated how AT-101 induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells. Exposure to AT-101 significantly increased apoptosis in both human leukemia cell lines and primary human leukemia cells. This increase was accompanied by the activation of caspases, cytochrome c release, Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) translocation, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) downregulation, Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) dephosphorylation, Akt inactivation, and RhoA/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1/phosphatase and tensin homolog (RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN) activation. RhoA, rather than caspase-3 cleavage, mediated the cleavage/activation of ROCK1 that AT-101 induced. Inhibiting RhoA and ROCK1 activation by C3 exoenzyme (C3) and Y27632, respectively, attenuated the ROCK1 cleavage/activation, PTEN activity, Akt inactivation, Mcl-1 downregulation, Bad dephosphorylation, and apoptosis mediated by AT-101. Knocking down ROCK1 expression using a ROCK1-specific siRNA also significantly abrogated AT-101-mediated apoptosis. Constitutively active Akt prevented the AT-101-induced Mcl-1 downregulation, Bad dephosphorylation, and apoptosis. Conversely, AT-101 lethality was potentiated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. In vivo, the tumor growth inhibition caused by AT-101 was also associated with RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN activation and Akt inactivation in a mouse leukemia xenograft model. Collectively, these findings suggest that AT-101 may preferentially induce apoptosis in leukemia cells by interrupting the RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN pathway, leading to Akt inactivation, Mcl-1 downregulation, Bad dephosphorylation, and Bax translocation, which culminate in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis.","['Li, G', 'Liu, L', 'Shan, C', 'Cheng, Q', 'Budhraja, A', 'Zhou, T', 'Cui, H', 'Gao, N']","['Li G', 'Liu L', 'Shan C', 'Cheng Q', 'Budhraja A', 'Zhou T', 'Cui H', 'Gao N']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Graduate Center for Toxicology, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gossypol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4040709,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013519 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.519 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jan 16;5:e998. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.519.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated the associations between 20 germline variations and various clinical end points in 463 children with ALL. RESULTS: After adjusting for known prognostic factors, variants in two genes were found to be independently associated with poorer EFS: ABCB1 T/T at either 2677 (rs2032582) or 3435 (rs1045642) position (P=0.003) and IL15 67276493G/G (rs17015014; P=0.022). These variants showed a strong additive effect affecting outcome (P<0.001), whereby patients with both risk genotypes had the worst EFS (P=0.001), even after adjusting for MRD levels at the end of remission induction. The adverse effect of ABCB1 T/T genotypes was most pronounced in patients with favourable cytogenetics (P=0.011) while the IL15 67276493G/G genotype mainly affected patients without common chromosomal abnormalities (P=0.022). In both cytogenetic subgroups, increasing number of such risk genotypes still predicted worsening outcome (P<0.001 and=0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results point to the prognostic importance of host genetic variants, although the specific mechanisms remain unclarified. Inclusion of ABCB1 and IL15 variants may help improve risk assignment strategies in paediatric ALL.","['Lu, Y', 'Kham, S K Y', 'Ariffin, H', 'Oei, A M I', 'Lin, H P', 'Tan, A M', 'Quah, T C', 'Yeoh, A E J']","['Lu Y', 'Kham SK', 'Ariffin H', 'Oei AM', 'Lin HP', 'Tan AM', 'Quah TC', 'Yeoh AE']","['Division of Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health System, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Division of Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health System, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', '1] Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia [2] University of Malaya Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediarics, Sime Darby Medical Centre Subang Jaya, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.', ""Department of Paediatric Medicine, Haematology/Oncology Service, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."", ""1] Division of Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health System, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore [2] Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore [3] National University Cancer Institute Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore."", ""1] Division of Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health System, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore [2] Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore [3] National University Cancer Institute Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Interleukin-15)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3960629,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc20147 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Mar 18;110(6):1673-80. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.7.

Here, we describe a functional assay for AKR1C3 in cells using the fluorogenic probe coumberone (a substrate for all AKR1C isoforms) in conjunction with a specific inhibitor of AKR1C3, the morpholylurea SN34037. We use this assay to evaluate AKR1C3 activity and PR-104A sensitivity in human leukaemia cells. SN34037-sensitive reduction of coumberone to fluorescent coumberol correlated with AKR1C3 protein expression by immunoblotting in a panel of seven diverse human leukaemia cell lines, and with SN34037-sensitive reduction of PR-104A to PR-104H. SN34037 inhibited aerobic cytotoxicity of PR-104A in high-AKR1C3 TF1 erythroleukaemia cells, but not in low-AKR1C3 Nalm6 pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (B-ALL) cells, although variation in PR-104H sensitivity confounded the relationship between AKR1C3 activity and PR-104A sensitivity across the cell line panel. AKR1C3 mRNA expression showed wide variation between leukaemia patients, with consistently higher levels in T-ALL than B-ALL. In short term cultures from patient-derived paediatric ALL xenografts, PR-104A was more potent in T-ALL than B-ALL lines, and PR-104A cytotoxicity was significantly inhibited by SN34037 in T-ALL but not B-ALL.

In the last decade, our understanding of CLL and consequently our diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have changed dramatically. Conventional fludarabine based chemotherapy has led to improved disease response and longer survival in young patients with CLL. However its application in elderly patients has been restricted by substantial myelosuppression and infection. Treatment of CLL is now moving towards targeted therapy. The success of new class of agents such as monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory derivatives has sparked further search for treatment agents with novel targets to inhibit. The B cell receptor activating pathway involving the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is crucial in B cell production and maintenance and is an attractive therapeutic target. Ibrutinib is an oral covalent inhibitor of the BTK pathway that induces apoptosis of B cells. Early phase studies with Ibrutinib either as a single agent or in combination regimens have shown promising results with an excellent safety profile in patients with high-risk, refractory or relapsed CLL and elderly treatment-naive patients.

The prevalence of alterations in the serum concentrations of fat soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D, in cats with IBD and ISCL is unknown. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to measure serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations in cats with IBD or ISCL. Serum 25(OH)D also was measured in healthy cats, and in hospitalized ill cats with nongastrointestinal diseases. ANIMALS: Eighty-four cats were included in the study: 23 in the healthy group, 41 in the hospitalized ill group, and 20 in the IBD/ISCL group. METHODS: Retrospective study. Serum samples for vitamin D analysis were frozen at -20 degrees C until serum 25(OH)D was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Although there was overlap in serum 25(OH)D concentrations among the 3 groups, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in the cats with IBD or ISCL compared to healthy cats (P < .0001) and hospitalized ill cats (P = .014). In the IBD/ISCL group, there was a significant moderate positive correlation between serum albumin and 25(OH)D concentrations (r = 0.58, P = .018). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The median serum concentration of 25(OH)D was significantly lower in cats with IBD/ISCL than in healthy cats and in hospitalized ill cats. Additional studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of hypovitaminosis D in cats with gastrointestinal diseases, to define the best management strategy to treat this complication, and to investigate its potential prognostic implications.","['Lalor, S', 'Schwartz, A M', 'Titmarsh, H', 'Reed, N', 'Tasker, S', 'Boland, L', 'Berry, J', 'Gunn-Moore, D', 'Mellanby, R J']","['Lalor S', 'Schwartz AM', 'Titmarsh H', 'Reed N', 'Tasker S', 'Boland L', 'Berry J', 'Gunn-Moore D', 'Mellanby RJ']","['The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Division of Clinical Veterinary Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,"['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*blood', 'Cats/blood', 'Female', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/blood/*veterinary', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/blood/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood']",PMC4858012,2014/01/18 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2013/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jvim.12294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2014 Mar-Apr;28(2):351-5. doi: 10.1111/jvim.12294.

The treatment of blood malignancies employing targeted particulate drug delivery systems presents unique challenges and considerable research has been focused towards the development of targeted liposomal formulations for B cell malignancies. These formulations are aimed at achieving selectivity towards the malignant cells by targeting several cell surface markers which are over-expressed in that specific malignancy. CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD74 are few of such markers of which CD19, CD22 and CD74 are internalizing and CD20 is non-internalizing.

Recommendations for post-remission therapy depend on assessing the leukemia risk characteristics, such as cytogenetics and molecular features present at diagnosis. Patients with high-risk disease include those whose leukemia is characterized by monosomal karyotype or poor-risk cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, patients with antecedent hematologic disorders or therapy-related AML, and presence of adverse host factors, such as comorbidities, impaired performance status or older age. Older patients are more likely to have these adverse features. High-risk AML responds poorly to available induction treatment and is likely to relapse despite consolidation therapy. Current data support an increasing understanding of prognosis but have not yet resulted in effective therapies for patients with high-risk disease. This review discusses current therapies and evolving treatment strategies for high-risk AML.","['Schiller, Gary J']",['Schiller GJ'],"['Hematological Malignancy, Stem Cell Transplant Program, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA , Los Angeles, CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140307,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Therapy/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.881479 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Nov;55(11):2438-48. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.881479.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included adult patients with cryptococcosis treated at the Hematology Research Center (HRC) in 2005 to 2011. The diagnosis of cryptococcosis was established on the basis of isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans from a blood culture or determination of positive cryptococcal antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with infection symptoms. RESULTS: During 7 years, 19 patients aged 19 to 68 years (median 47 years) were diagnosed as having cryptococcosis. In the pattern of cryptococcosis, there was a preponderance of patients with lymphoma (31%) and those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (26%) at the stages of hemoblastosis remission induction (32%) and consolidation (26%). The diagnosis was made in 9 (47%) patients at the Intensive Care Department, HRC. The major risk factors of cryptococcosis were previous cytostatic drug exposure (68%), use of immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid drugs (63%), and granulocytopenia (42%). Seventeen (78%) patients were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis or meningoencephalitis; 1 patient had cryptococcal sepsis and 1 patient had possible cryptococcal pneumonia. All the patients were given antifungal agents. Amphotericin B, fluconazole, and a combination of antimycotics were used as first-line drugs in 16 (84%), 1 (5.5%), and 2 (10.5%), respectively. When their health became better, the patients were treated with voriconazole or fluconazole. Within 30 days after the diagnosis of cryptococcosis, 5 (26%) patients died; of them 2 had tumor progression concurrent with infection. CONCLUSION: In cryptococcosis, the central nervous system is predominantly involved in the infectious process. The determination of cryptococcal antigen in CSF is a necessary diagnostic component in meningitis and meningoencephalitis in patients with blood system tumors, lymphatic ones in particular. When cryptococcosis is timely diagnosed and treated, its mortality, when the tumor is controlled, is lower than that in other invasive mycoses.","['Khodunova, E E', 'Frolova, I N', 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Galstian, G M', 'Kostina, I E', 'Mikhailova, E A', 'Gracheva, A N', 'Kliasova, G A']","['Khodunova EE', 'Frolova IN', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Galstian GM', 'Kostina IE', 'Mikhailova EA', 'Gracheva AN', 'Kliasova GA']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cryptococcosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Cryptococcus neoformans/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Russia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2013;85(11):41-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three AML patients (28 men and 35 women) aged 20 to 77 years (median 50 years) were examined. According to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, the types of AML were as follows: M0 (n = 3), M1 (n = 9), M2 (n = 35), M4 (n = 10), and M5 (n = 6). All the patients had chemotherapy-associated neutropenia (granulocytes, less than 0.5.10(9)/l). In different treatment steps, all the patients developed infectious complications (the study analyzed the data of 86 cases). RESULTS: In patients with localized infections (such as mucositis, abscess, pneumonia, etc.) or fever of unknown origin (FUO), the levels of CRP were not statistically significant different, but were significantly higher than in those without infectious complications. The concentrations of CRP did not differ in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and in those with sepsis. At the same time, the level of CRP in systemic infection (SIRS, sepsis) was significantly higher than that in localized infection (p < 0.001). In patients with neutropenia, the median CRP levels were as follows: 7 mg/l (range 0-37; 95% reference interval (RI) 0 to 32) for those without infection 56 mg/l (range 13-104; 95% RI 17 to 104) for those with localized infection or FUO; and 168 mg/l (range 103-399; 95% RI 105 to 362) for those with systemic infection. CONCLUSION: CRP is a marker of the severity of an infectious process in AML patients with neutropenia. The increase of its level more than 32 mg/l serves a valid criterion for the presence of infection and more than 105 mg/l does for that of a systemic inflammatory response in these patients.","['Vladimirova, S G', 'Tarasova, L N', ""Sokol'skaia, O Iu"", 'Cherepanova, V V']","['Vladimirova SG', 'Tarasova LN', ""Sokol'skaia OIu"", 'Cherepanova VV']",,['rus'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*blood/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*blood/diagnosis/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/18 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2014/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2013;85(11):34-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VLRB-bearing lymphocytes respond to immunization with proliferation and differentiation into plasmacytes that secrete multivalent VLRB antibodies. Here we immunized lampreys with B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to generate recombinant monoclonal VLRB antibodies, one of which, VLR39, was specific for the donor CLL cells. The target epitope of VLR39 was shown to be the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the heavy chain variable region (VH) of the B cell receptor. Using this antibody to monitor the CLL donor after chemo-immunotherapy-induced remission, we detected VLR39(+) B cells in the patient 51 months later, before significant increase in lymphocyte count or CD5(+) B cells. This indication of reemergence of the leukemic clone was verified by VH sequencing. Lamprey antibodies can exhibit exquisite specificity for a protein epitope, a CLL signature VH CDR3 sequence in this case, and offer a rapid strategy for generating anti-idiotype antibodies for early detection of leukemia recurrence.","['Nakahara, Hirotomo', 'Herrin, Brantley R', 'Alder, Matthew N', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Cooper, Max D']","['Nakahara H', 'Herrin BR', 'Alder MN', 'Catera R', 'Yan XJ', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Cooper MD']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Lampreys/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Plasma Cells/*cytology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology']",PMC3888878,2014/01/17 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-13-0052 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2013 Oct;1(4):223-8. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-13-0052.,,,,"['T32 AI007051/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008169/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'CA172164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072435/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI039816/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS525718'],['NOTNLM'],"['B cell receptor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'idiotype', 'lamprey antibodies', 'tumor cell markers']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of OFA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is limited by drug resistance, which is not well characterized. To better understand mechanisms of resistance, we prospectively studied CLL cells isolated from blood samples collected before and after in vivo exposure to the initial dose of OFA therapy in 25 patients undergoing their first treatment for progressive CLL. As previously reported, OFA therapy rapidly decreased the absolute lymphocyte count, CD20 expression by CLL cells, and serum complement levels. We now show that after administration of the first dose of OFA, there was a modest rebound in the absolute lymphocyte count and serum complement levels, but substantial ongoing loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. These post-OFA treatment CLL cells were highly resistant to OFA-mediated CDC but retained sensitivity to alemtuzumab-mediated CDC in vitro. Posttherapy serum OFA levels correlated inversely with both the amount of pretreatment circulating cell-bound CD20 and with the decrease in this value following treatment. In vitro OFA-mediated CDC did not predict clinical responses, and the patients with first-dose reactions to OFA did not have markers of increased complement activation in vivo. We propose that optimal efficacy of CD20- targeted therapy for CLL requires determining an mAb dose size and frequency that optimizes CLL killing without exceeding the capacity of the cytotoxic mechanisms and thus minimizes loss of CD20 expression in the surviving CLL cells.","['Baig, Nisar A', 'Taylor, Ronald P', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Church, Amy K', 'LaPlant, Betsy R', 'Pettinger, Adam M', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Nowakowski, Grzegorz S', 'Zent, Clive S']","['Baig NA', 'Taylor RP', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Church AK', 'LaPlant BR', 'Pettinger AM', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Nowakowski GS', 'Zent CS']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis/blood/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4391060,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302954 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302954 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Feb 15;192(4):1620-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302954.

Dar consists of dimethylarsenic conjugated to glutathione (GSH). Dar induces more intracellular arsenic accumulation and more cell death than the FDA-approved arsenic trioxide (ATO) in vitro, but exhibits less systemic toxicity. Here, we propose a mechanism for Dar import that might explain these characteristics. Structural analysis of Dar suggests a putative breakdown product: dimethylarsino-cysteine (DMAC). We show that DMAC is very similar to Dar in terms of intracellular accumulation of arsenic, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. We found that inhibition of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (gamma-GT) protects human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) from Dar, but not from DMAC, suggesting a role for gamma-GT in the processing of Dar. Overall, our data support a model where Dar, a GSH S-conjugate, is processed at the cell surface by gamma-GT, leading to formation of DMAC, which is imported via xCT, xAG, or potentially other cystine/cysteine importing systems. Further, we propose that Dar induces its own import via increased xCT expression. These mechanisms may explain the enhanced toxicity of Dar toward cancer cells compared with ATO.","['Garnier, Nicolas', 'Redstone, Genevieve G J', 'Dahabieh, Michael S', 'Nichol, Jessica N', 'del Rincon, Sonia V', 'Gu, Yuxuan', 'Bohle, D Scott', 'Sun, Yan', 'Conklin, Douglas S', 'Mann, Koren K', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Garnier N', 'Redstone GG', 'Dahabieh MS', 'Nichol JN', 'del Rincon SV', 'Gu Y', 'Bohle DS', 'Sun Y', 'Conklin DS', 'Mann KK', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Department of Oncology, Segal Cancer Center, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

However, only half of the patients that are treated will benefit from this treatment. It is a major challenge to predict which patients are likely to respond to treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of immunophenotyping for response to treatment with azacitidine of Int-2 and high risk MDS patients. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were analyzed by flow cytometry in 42 patients with Int-2 and high risk MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia before treatment and after every third cycle of azacitidine. A flow score was calculated using the flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS). Results: The presence of myeloid progenitors with an aberrant immunophenotype was significantly associated with lack of response (p=0.02). A low pretreatment FCSS was associated with significantly better overall survival compared with a high pretreatment FCSS (p=0.03). A significant decrease in FCSS was observed in patients with complete response after three cycles azacitidine compared to patients with progressive disease (p=0.006). Conclusions: Absence of aberrant myeloid progenitor cells at baseline and/or a decrease in the FCSS during treatment identified Int-2 and high risk MDS patients who are likely to respond to treatment with azacitidine.

The aim of this study was to examine the apoptotic effect of PFT on human multidrug-resistant (MDR) myeloid leukemia (HL60/AR) cells in vitro and explore the mechanistic approach underlying its effect. HL60/AR cells were cultured with PFT (0.6-5.0 mg/ml) for 3 days. The apoptotic effect of PFT was assessed through examination of percent apoptosis, caspase 3 activation, Bcl-2 expression levels and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). PFT induced apoptosis in HL60/AR cells in a dose-dependent manner which was maximal at 67.5% for 5 mg/ml. Induction of apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase 3, decreased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased polarization of MMP. In addition, PFT showed a unique characteristic of piercing holes in HL60/AR cells, as indicated by AFM studies. This hole induction may be responsible for the apoptotic effect on cancer cells. These results suggest that PFT may act as a potential therapy for the treatment of MDR leukemia.","['Ghoneum, Mamdooh', 'Gimzewski, James']","['Ghoneum M', 'Gimzewski J']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Charles R.

Although recent studies have revealed that the therapeutic action of As4S4 is closely associated with the induction of cellular apoptosis, the exact molecular mechanism underlying this action in RA-resistant APL remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that As4S4-induced apoptosis was accompanied by reduced mRNA and protein expression of SET gene in RA-resistant NB4-R1 cells. Moreover, RNAi knockdown of SET gene further promoted As4S4-induced apoptosis, while SET overexpression recovered the cell viability, suggesting that As4S4 induces apoptosis through the reduction of SET protein in NB4-R1 cells. We also observed that the knockdown of SET gene resulted in the upregulation of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) expression and the downregulation of promyelocytic leukemia and retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion gene (PML-RARalpha) expression, which were enhanced by As4S4 treatments. By contrast, overexpression of SET gene resulted in PP2A downregulation and PML-RARalpha upregulation, which were abolished by As4S4 pretreatment. Since PP2A is a proapoptotic factor and PML-RARalpha is an antiapoptotic factor, our results suggest that As4S4-induced apoptosis in RA-resistant NB4-R1 cells is through the downregulation of SET protein expression, which, in turn, increases PP2A and reduces PML-RARalpha expressions to lead to cell apoptosis.","['Liu, Yanfeng', 'He, Pengcheng', 'Liu, Feng', 'Zhou, Naicen', 'Cheng, Xiaoyan', 'Shi, Lili', 'Zhu, Huachao', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Zhang, Mei']","['Liu Y', 'He P', 'Liu F', 'Zhou N', 'Cheng X', 'Shi L', 'Zhu H', 'Zhao J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, 710061.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZIK02R2PSD (tetraarsenic tetrasulfide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Histone Chaperones/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2013/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1452-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Apr;35(4):3421-30. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1452-1.

The present study of CLL staging assesses outcomes of melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma in this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: To determine if progression of CLL measured by advanced Rai stage (III or IV) is associated with worse skin cancer outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-year retrospective study at 2 academic centers in Boston, Massachusetts, of adults with CLL and either melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for the development of poor skin cancer outcomes (local recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, or death from skin cancer). RESULTS: In total, 133 patients with 377 primary skin cancers and a median follow-up of 41 months were included. Squamous cell carcinoma predominated (92.0%). The risk of death from skin cancer was equivalent to the risk of death from CLL (13.5%). On multivariate analysis, advanced Rai stage (III or IV) at the time of the first skin cancer diagnosis (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9) and a high skin cancer tumor (T) stage (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.2-10.8) were associated with poor skin cancer outcomes. Those with both a low skin cancer T stage and a low Rai stage (n = 265) had a low risk (5.3%; 95% CI, 3.2%-8.7%) of poor skin cancer outcomes. Those with a low T stage and a high Rai stage (n = 89) had a significantly higher risk of poor skin cancer outcomes (16.9%; 95% CI, 10.9%-26.0%). The 23 patients with a high T stage had high risks of poor outcomes regardless of CLL status (27.3% if a low Rai stage and 50.0% if a high Rai stage, with wide 95% CIs). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with CLL and non-basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, mortality is as high from skin cancer as from CLL. The Rai stage and skin cancer T stage should be considered when risk-stratifying patients with skin cancer. Regular communication between dermatologists and oncologists will help facilitate the identification of patients with CLL who are at high risk of having poor skin cancer outcomes.","['Velez, Nicole F', 'Karia, Pritesh S', 'Vartanov, Alexander R', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Schmults, Chrysalyne D']","['Velez NF', 'Karia PS', 'Vartanov AR', 'Davids MS', 'Brown JR', 'Schmults CD']","[""Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,JAMA Dermatol,JAMA dermatology,101589530,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Boston', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/epidemiology/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology/pathology', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1813119 [pii]', '10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.6249 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Dermatol. 2014 Mar;150(3):280-7. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.6249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of beta-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated beta-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased beta-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Kode, Aruna', 'Manavalan, John S', 'Mosialou, Ioanna', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Rathinam, Chozha V', 'Luo, Na', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'Lee,

Study objectives included determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), time to progression, time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Of 38 registered patients, 37 were treated and evaluable for efficacy and safety. Thirty-one carfilzomib-based regimens using 14 different drug combinations were tested. One regimen (carfilzomib (45 mg/m(2)), ascorbic acid (1000 mg) and cyclophosphamide (2.2 mg/kg)) reached MTD. ORR and CBR were 43.2 and 62.2%, respectively. Median progression-free survival, time to progression and OS were 8.3, 9.9 and 15.8 months, respectively. Hematologic adverse events (AEs; grade 3) included lymphopenia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (24.3%), anemia (10.8%) and neutropenia (10.8%).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the differential characteristics of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes caused by TB and CLL using multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis for the anatomical distribution and enhancement patterns of mediastinal lymph nodes on MDCT in 67 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed untreated TB (58%) and CLL (42%). RESULTS: Concerning the main anatomic distribution of lymph nodes, TB involved the 4R (n = 32, 82%) and 10R (n = 27, 69%) regions more often than CLL (n = 16, 57%; n = 12, 43%, respectively). Contrast region 1 had a greater tendency to be affected in CLL (n = 16, 57%) than TB (n = 11, 28%). TB showed peripheral enhancement in 28 cases (72%), frequently with a multilocular appearance, compared to CLL, which showed no peripheral enhancement in these cases. Homogeneous enhancement was more commonly seen in CLL than in TB (82% vs. 10%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The distribution and enhancement pattern of enlarged lymph nodes on MDCT was useful in differentiating TB and CLL.","['Zhang, S', 'Yang, Z-G', 'Liu, X', 'Wen, L-Y', 'Zhang, G', 'Xu, H-Y', 'Long, Q-H']","['Zhang S', 'Yang ZG', 'Liu X', 'Wen LY', 'Zhang G', 'Xu HY', 'Long QH']","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, and Department of Radiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, and Department of Radiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, and Department of Radiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,France,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,9706389,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymph Nodes/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Aged', '*Multidetector Computed Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tuberculosis, Lymph Node/*diagnostic imaging']",,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5588/ijtld.13.0500 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis. 2014 Feb;18(2):211-5. doi: 10.5588/ijtld.13.0500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an oxidative stress pathway modulator, is suggested as a potential combination therapy for ATO-insensitive leukemia. However, the precise mechanism of BSO-mediated augmentation of ATO-induced apoptosis is not fully understood. In this study we compared the difference in cell death of HL60 leukemia cells treated with ATO/BSO and ATO alone, and investigated the detailed molecular mechanism of BSO-mediated augmentation of ATO-induced cell death. METHODS: HL60 APL cells were used for the study. The activation and expression of a series of signal molecules were analyzed with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Apoptotic cell death was detected with caspases and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. Generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined using a redox-sensitive dye. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization was observed with a confocal microscopy using NIR dye and cytochrome c release was determined with immunoblotting. Small interfering (si) RNA was used for inhibition of gene expression. RESULTS: HL60 cells became more susceptible to ATO in the presence of BSO. ATO/BSO-induced mitochondrial injury was accompanied by reduced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release and caspase activation. ATO/BSO-induced mitochondrial injury was inhibited by antioxidants. Addition of BSO induced phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 protein, BIMEL, and anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein, MCL1, in treated cells. Phosphorylated BIMEL was dissociated from MCL1 and interacted with BAX, followed by conformational change of BAX. Furthermore, the knockdown of BIMEL with small interfering RNA inhibited the augmentation of ATO-induced apoptosis by BSO. CONCLUSIONS: The enhancing effect of BSO on ATO-induced cell death was characterized at the molecular level for clinical use. Addition of BSO induced mitochondrial injury-mediated apoptosis via the phosphorylation of BIMEL and MCL1, resulting in their dissociation and increased the interaction between BIMEL and BAX.","['Tanaka, Yukie', 'Komatsu, Takayuki', 'Shigemi, Hiroko', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Fujii, Yutaka']","['Tanaka Y', 'Komatsu T', 'Shigemi H', 'Yamauchi T', 'Fujii Y']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Aichi Medical University, 1-1 Yazako-Karimata, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan. koma@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4029189,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-27 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-27 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jan 15;14:27. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Six S14161 analogs were designed based on the structure-activity relationship; activity of the compounds in terms of cell death and inhibition of PI3K were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively; anti-myeloma activity in vivo was performed on two independent xenograft models. RESULTS: Among the six analogs, BENC-511 was one of the most potent compounds which significantly inhibited PI3K activity and induced MM cell apoptosis. BENC-511 was able to inactivate PI3K and its downstream signals AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 at 1 muM but had no effects on their total protein expression. Consistent with its effects on PI3K activity, BENC-511 induced MM cell apoptosis which was evidenced by the cleavage of Caspase-3 and PARP. Notably, addition of insulin-like growth factor 1 and interleukin-6, two important triggers for PI3K activation in MM cells, partly blocked BENC-511-induced MM cell death, which further demonstrated that PI3K signaling pathway was critical for the anti-myeloma activity of BENC-511. Moreover, BENC-511 also showed potent oral activity against myeloma in vivo. Oral administration of BENC-511 decreased tumor growth up to 80% within 3 weeks in two independent MM xenograft models at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, but presented minimal toxicity. Suppression of BENC-511 on MM tumor growth was associated with decreased PI3K/AKT activity and increased cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its potent anti-MM activity, low toxicity (LD50 oral >1.5 g/kg), and easy synthesis, BENC-511 could be developed as a promising agent for the treatment of MM via suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","['Han, Kunkun', 'Xu, Xin', 'Chen, Guodong', 'Zeng, Yuanying', 'Zhu, Jingyu', 'Du, Xiaolin', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Liu, Zhaopeng', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Han K', 'Xu X', 'Chen G', 'Zeng Y', 'Zhu J', 'Du X', 'Zhang Z', 'Cao B', 'Liu Z', 'Mao X']","['Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, China. xinliangmao@suda.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (6-bromo-8-ethoxy-3-nitro-2H-chromene)', '0 (8-ethoxy-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-nitro-2H-chromene)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3924225,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-9 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jan 15;7:9. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Engagement of CD137L on haematopoietic progenitor cells induces monocytic differentiation, and in peripheral monocytes CD137L signalling promotes differentiation to mature dendritic cells. We hypothesized that CD137L signalling would also induce differentiation in transformed myeloid cells. Here we show that recombinant CD137 protein, which crosslinks CD137L and initiates reverse CD137L signalling in myeloid cells, induces morphological changes (adherence, spreading), loss of progenitor markers (CD117), expression of maturation markers (CD11b, CD13) and secretion of cytokines that are indicative of myeloid differentiation. Under the influence of CD137L signalling, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells acquired expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40), the dendritic cell marker CD83 and dendritic cell activities, enabling them to stimulate T cells. CD137L signalling induced differentiation in 71% (15 of 21) of AML samples, irrespective of French-American-British classification and CD137L expression level. However, the type of response varied with the AML subtype and patient sample. In summary, this study demonstrated that CD137L signalling induced differentiation in malignant cells of AML patients, and suggests that it may be worthwhile to investigate treatment with recombinant CD137 protein as a potential novel therapeutic approach for AML.","['Cheng, Kin', 'Wong, Siew Cheng', 'Linn, Yeh Ching', 'Ho, Liam Pock', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Schwarz, Herbert']","['Cheng K', 'Wong SC', 'Linn YC', 'Ho LP', 'Chng WJ', 'Schwarz H']","['Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore City, Singapore; Immunology Programme, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore City, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/17 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12732 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Apr;165(1):134-44. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12732.

We hypothesized that SR-ALL survivors would have greater reported executive dysfunction compared to HC, and that those younger at the time of treatment would demonstrate greater EF difficulties. A sample of 256 SR-ALL survivors evaluated an average nine years after treatment were compared to HC matched for gender, assessment age, and maternal education. Profile analysis was used to compare the groups across EF scales on the BRIEF. The prevalence of clinical elevations in the groups was compared via chi square, and odds ratios were calculated. Regression models were applied to examine the role of age at diagnosis and age at assessment in reported EF. Results indicated that SR-ALL survivors' mean scores of EF are similar to HC, except for flexibility and initiation. Survivors were rated as having clinical impairments with flexibility, initiation, working memory, and emotional control at rates two to three times that of HC. The risk of working memory and self-monitoring deficits was greater in survivors who were older when assessed. There was no relationship between age at diagnosis or treatment regimen on EF. These findings suggest sparing of extensive and severe EF deficits in SR-ALL survivors overall. However, a subset of survivors displays clinically significant executive dysfunction. There appears to be a heightened susceptibility to disrupted metacognitive functions as survivors age. This has implications for how we monitor neurocognitive development and functioning of SR-ALL survivors, and highlights opportunities for cognitive interventions.","['Walsh, Karin S', 'Paltin, Iris', 'Gioia, Gerard A', 'Isquith, Peter', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Brouwers, Pim']","['Walsh KS', 'Paltin I', 'Gioia GA', 'Isquith P', 'Kadan-Lottick NS', 'Neglia JP', 'Brouwers P']","[""a Children's National Medical Center & The George Washington University Medical Center , Washington , DC , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140116,England,Child Neuropsychol,Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence,9512515,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cognition', '*Emotions', '*Executive Function', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Memory, Short-Term', 'Neuropsychological Tests/statistics & numerical data', 'Parents/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Time Factors']",,2014/01/17 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/09297049.2013.876491 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Neuropsychol. 2015;21(1):78-89. doi: 10.1080/09297049.2013.876491.

To date the existing studies have focused on the perspective of parents of children with cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life (QoL), symptom prevalence and management, functional ability, and the quality of care among children with cancer at the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was used. A convenience sample of 85 patients on therapy aged 7 to 18 years participated in the study between 2010 and 2011. Using face to face interviews, a combination of four instruments were administered in Arabic. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 12.5 years, with the majority having leukemia. Overall, the children had satisfactory health-related QoL, with the exception of the nausea and worry subscales, had no limitations in functional abilities, and were satisfied with the care that they received. In children between 7 to 12 years, the most common symptoms were lack of appetite, pain, and nausea, while adolescents between 13 to 18 years experienced lack of energy, irritability, and pain. Pain and nausea were the most frequently treated symptoms. CONCLUSION: Although the participants reported satisfactory QoL, yet symptom management was inadequate and mainly focused on treating the physical symptoms. It is recommended to provide both pharmacological and psychological interventions in order to alleviate symptom burden and hence improve QoL in children with cancer.","['Abu-Saad Huijer, Huda', 'Sagherian, Knar', 'Tamim, Hani', 'Naifeh Khoury, May', 'Abboud, Miguel R']","['Abu-Saad Huijer H', 'Sagherian K', 'Tamim H', 'Naifeh Khoury M', 'Abboud MR']","['American University of Beirut, Lebanon, Faculty of Nursing Science, Hariri School of Nursing. huda.huijer@aub.edu.lb', 'American University of Beirut, Lebanon, Hariri School of Nursing.', 'American University of Beirut, Lebanon, Biostatistics Unit.', 'American University of Beirut, Lebanon, Faculty of Medicine, Hariri School of Nursing.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Lebanon,J Med Liban,Le Journal medical libanais.

Herein, we describe a case of aplastic anemia occurring in Down's syndrome following post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A 27-year-old Japanese male with Down's syndrome presented with a headache. Laboratory tests revealed severe pancytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypocellular bone marrow with decrease of trilineage cells, which led to a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. One year after diagnosis, he was incidentally found to have an anterior mediastinal tumor, which was histopathologically diagnosed as seminoma. Subsequently, he received BMT from a female donor, and engraftment was observed. Three months after transplantation, he experienced cough and high fever. Biopsy specimen from the lung revealed diffuse proliferation of large-sized lymphoid cells expressing CD20 and EBER. These lymphoid cells had XY chromosomes. Thus, a diagnosis of EBV-associated PTLD was made. This is the seventh documented case of aplastic anemia occurring in Down's syndrome.

In July 2011, she developed pyrexia, headaches, and nausea, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive aggressive natural killer leukemia (ANKL) was diagnosed on the basis of both a peripheral blood and bone marrow examination. An inguinal lymph node biopsy, on the other hand, revealed EBV-positive cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma plus the presence of a small number of EBV-positive ANKL cells, and a diagnosis of EBV-positive composite lymphoma was made. Both the cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma and ANKL exhibited EBV terminal repeat (Southern blot analysis) monoclonal patterns, and they were almost the same size, approximately 9.0 kb. If it was the identical EBV clone, it is possible that EBV infected progenitor cells common to both NK cells and T cells, that the progenitor cells then differentiated into NK cells and T cells, a chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection developed, and neoplastic transformation occurred. If it was not the identical EBV clone, fairly similar EBVs must have infected NK cells and T cells separately, and they then underwent neoplastic transformation. Because the mechanism by which EBV infects NK cells or T cells is still unknown, we concluded that this case is also important from the standpoint of elucidating it. We are currently in the process of conducting gene analyses to determine whether the fairly similar EBVs that infected the ANKL and cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma are the identical clone.","['Sugimoto, Kei-Ji', 'Shimada, Asami', 'Wakabayashi, Mutsumi', 'Imai, Hidenori', 'Sekiguchi, Yasunobu', 'Nakamura, Noriko', 'Sawada, Tomohiro', 'Ota, Yasunori', 'Takeuchi, Kengo', 'Ito, Yoshinori', 'Kimura, Hiroshi', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Noguchi, Masaaki']","['Sugimoto KJ', 'Shimada A', 'Wakabayashi M', 'Imai H', 'Sekiguchi Y', 'Nakamura N', 'Sawada T', 'Ota Y', 'Takeuchi K', 'Ito Y', 'Kimura H', 'Komatsu N', 'Noguchi M']","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo Japan.', 'Pathology Project for Molecular Targets, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Virology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital Urayasu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131215,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,IM,"['Composite Lymphoma/*pathology/*virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology', 'Insect Bites and Stings/immunology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*pathology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology/*virology', 'Middle Aged']",PMC3885499,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/09/06 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2013 Dec 15;7(1):411-7. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aggressive NK leukemia', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'composite lymphoma', 'cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma', 'large granular lymphocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three lymphomas were morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct while flow cytometry detected two monoclonal B-cell populations. Karyotyping and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for B-cell clonality each detected a single monoclonal B-cell population. The morphology findings may suggest DLBCL being transformed from FL while Richter transformation from SLL appears to be less likely in our case.

Primary prostate cancer cells were amplified in keratinocyte serum-free medium with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE), supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stem cell factor (SCF) and cholera toxin. After amplification, cells were transferred into ultra-low attachment dishes with serum-free DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with EGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, and N2 nutrition. Expression of cell-type-specific markers was determined by RT-qPCR and immunostaining. Tumorigenicity of enriched PrCSC was determined by soft agar assay and xenograft assay in NOD/SCID mice. Biopsy samples from 19 confirmed prostate cancer patients were used for establishing PPrCC, and 18 cases (95%) succeeded. Both basal marker (CK5) and luminal markers (androgen receptor and CK8) strongly co-expressed in most of PPrCC, indicating their basal epithelial origin. After amplification under adherent culture condition in vitro, transient amplifying cells were the dominant cells. Sphere formation efficiency (SFE) of passaged PPrCC was about 0.5%, which was 27 times lower than SFE of LNCaP (13.67%) in the same condition. Compared with adherent cells from PPrCC, prostasphere from PPrCC showed up regulated stem cell markers and increased tumorigenic potential in soft-agar assay. However, spheroid cells from PPrCC prostasphere failed to initiate tumor in xenograft assay in 6 months. Thus, PPrCC can be established and amplified from prostate cancer biopsy samples. Our modified sphere culture system can enrich PrCSC from PPrCC.","['Wang, Shunqi', 'Huang, Shengsong', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Zhang, Qimin', 'Wu, Min', 'Sun, Feng', 'Han, Gang', 'Wu, Denglong']","['Wang S', 'Huang S', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang Q', 'Wu M', 'Sun F', 'Han G', 'Wu D']","['Institute of Life Science, College of Life Sciences and Food Engineering, Nanchang University Nanchang, Jiangxi 330031, China ; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Andrology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 200031, China.', 'Department of Urology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital of Tongji Universit Shanghai, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Urology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital of Tongji Universit Shanghai, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Urology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital of Tongji Universit Shanghai, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Urology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital of Tongji Universit Shanghai, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Andrology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 200031, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Andrology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 200031, China.', 'Department of Urology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital of Tongji Universit Shanghai, Shanghai 200065, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131215,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3885472,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/09/06 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2013 Dec 15;7(1):184-93. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Prostate cancer (PrCa)', 'primary prostate cancer cultures (PPrCC)', 'prostate cancer stem cells (PrCSC)', 'sphere culture']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report that the BH3-only protein BIM, rather than BID, is essential to heat shock-induced cell death. We observed that BIM-deficient cells were highly resistant to heat shock, exhibiting short and long-term survival equivalent to Bax(-/-)Bak(-/-) cells and better than either Bid(-/-) or dominant-negative caspase-9-expressing cells. Only Bim(-/-) and Bax(-/-)Bak(-/-) cells exhibited resistance to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Moreover, while dimerized caspase-2 failed to induce apoptosis in Bid(-/-) cells, it readily did so in Bim(-/-) cells, implying that caspase-2 kills exclusively through BID, not BIM. Finally, BIM reportedly associates with MCL-1 following heat shock, and Mcl-1(-/-) cells were indeed sensitized to heat shock-induced apoptosis. However, pharmacological inhibition of BCL-2 and BCL-X(L) with ABT-737 also sensitized cells to heat shock, most likely through liberation of BIM. Thus, BIM mediates heat shock-induced apoptosis through a BAX/BAK-dependent pathway that is antagonized by antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members.","['Mahajan, Indra M', 'Chen, Miao-Der', 'Muro, Israel', 'Robertson, John D', 'Wright, Casey W', 'Bratton, Shawn B']","['Mahajan IM', 'Chen MD', 'Muro I', 'Robertson JD', 'Wright CW', 'Bratton SB']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park, Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Smithville, Texas, United States of America ; Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park, Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Smithville, Texas, United States of America ; Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park, Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Smithville, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140110,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspase 2/metabolism', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3888412,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/10/18 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084388 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-43595 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 10;9(1):e84388. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084388. eCollection 2014.,,,,"['R01 CA129521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM096101/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM096101/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LSCs are selectively resistant to various forms of therapy including irradiation or cytotoxic drugs. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has dramatically improved disease outcome in patients with CML. For AML, however, prognosis is still quite dismal. Standard treatments have been established more than 20 years ago with only limited advances ever since. Durable remission is achieved in less than 30% of patients. Minimal residual disease (MRD), reflected by the persistence of LSCs below the detection limit by conventional methods, causes a high rate of disease relapses. Therefore, the ultimate goal in the treatment of myeloid leukemia must be the eradication of LSCs. Active immunotherapy, aiming at the generation of leukemia-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), may represent a powerful approach to target LSCs in the MRD situation. To fully activate CTLs, leukemia antigens have to be successfully captured, processed, and presented by mature dendritic cells (DCs). Myeloid progenitors are a prominent source of DCs under homeostatic conditions, and it is now well established that LSCs and leukemic blasts can give rise to ""malignant"" DCs. These leukemia-derived DCs can express leukemia antigens and may either induce anti-leukemic T cell responses or favor tolerance to the leukemia, depending on co-stimulatory or -inhibitory molecules and cytokines. This review will concentrate on the role of DCs in myeloid leukemia immunotherapy with a special focus on their generation, application, and function and how they could be improved in order to generate highly effective and specific anti-leukemic CTL responses. In addition, we discuss how DC-based immunotherapy may be successfully integrated into current treatment strategies to promote remission and potentially cure myeloid leukemias.","['Schurch, Christian M', 'Riether, Carsten', 'Ochsenbein, Adrian F']","['Schurch CM', 'Riether C', 'Ochsenbein AF']","['Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern , Bern , Switzerland ; Institute of Pathology, University of Bern , Bern , Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern , Bern , Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern , Bern , Switzerland ; Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, University Hospital Bern , Bern , Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131231,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC3876024,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/01/16 06:01,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2013.00496 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2013 Dec 31;4:496. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00496.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['active', 'dendritic cells', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia stem cells', 'minimal residual disease', 'myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to technical complexity, this method still presents some level of variation between laboratories. In an attempt to yield more reproducible results, restrictive, highly standardized procedures have been proposed. The objective of this work was to compare this standardized protocol to a more open and flexible procedure. METHODS: The levels of expression of markers from the Euroflow lymphoid screening tube (LST) panel were evaluated on a population of both healthy and diseased patients using the recommended monoclonal antibody (MoAb) combinations or an alternative combination of either different MoAb clones or different dyes. Results were expressed as the percentages of positive target cells for each marker. RESULTS: Our study shows excellent correlation between the two methods demonstrating that comparable results can be achieved through harmonization of the procedures rather than through the constraints of standardization.

In order to improve survival, individualized treatment strategies and thus risk stratification algorithms are warranted, ideally already at the time of diagnosis. PROCEDURE: We analyzed the frequency and prognostic implication of mutations in NOTCH1 and FBXW7 in 79 cases of Swedish childhood T-ALL treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-1992 and ALL-2000 protocols. In a subgroup of patients, we also investigated the functional relevance of NOTCH1 mutations measured as expression of the HES1, MYB, and MYC genes. RESULTS: Forty-seven of the cases (59%) displayed mutations in NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7. There was no difference in overall (P = 0.14) or event-free survival (EFS) (P = 0.10) in patients with T-ALL with mutation(s) in NOTCH1/FBXW7 compared with patients with T-ALL without mutations in any of these genes. T-ALL carrying NOTCH1 mutations had increased HES1 and MYB mRNA expression (HES1 9.2 +/- 1.9 (mean +/- SEM), MYB 8.7 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SEM)) compared to T-ALL with wild-type NOTCH1 (HES1 1.8 +/- 0.7, MYB 5.1 +/- 1.2, P = 0.02 and 0.008, respectively). In cases of T-ALL with high HES1 expression, improved overall (P = 0.02) and EFS (P = 0.028) was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Increased NOTCH activity, reflected by increased HES1 expression, is associated with improved outcome in pediatric T-ALL, but its role as a diagnostic tool or a therapeutic target in future clinical treatment protocols remains to be elucidated.","['Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Staffas, Anna', 'Wasslavik, Carina', 'Sjogren, Helene', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Frost, Britt-Marie', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Degerman, Sofie', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Karrman, Kristina', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Palmqvist, Lars']","['Fogelstrand L', 'Staffas A', 'Wasslavik C', 'Sjogren H', 'Soderhall S', 'Frost BM', 'Forestier E', 'Degerman S', 'Behrendtz M', 'Heldrup J', 'Karrman K', 'Johansson B', 'Heyman M', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Palmqvist L']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131008,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Genes, myb', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24803 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Mar;61(3):424-30. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24803.

To address this issue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we investigated 20 cases with X or Y chromosome loss detected by conventional cytogenetics (CC). The frequency of SCL was low in CLL (2.3%). It was the sole abnormality, as detected by CC, in 10/20 (50%) patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses confirmed SCL in all patients tested, present in 5-88% of cells (median: 68%). Deletions of 13q were observed by FISH in 16/20 (80%) patients. Compared with CLL without SCL, SCL was significantly associated with 13q deletion, especially when bi-allelic (P = 0.04). Co-hybridization analyses showed that SCL could be a concomitant, primary or secondary change, or be present in an independent clone. FISH analyses were performed on blood sub-populations isolated by Ficoll or flow cytometry. Comparing mononuclear cells (including CLL cells) and polynuclear cells separated by Ficoll, a maximum of 2% of polynuclear cells were found with SCL, whereas mononuclear cells exhibited a significantly higher loss frequency (range: 6-87%) (P = 0.03). Comparing B-cells (including CLL cells) and T-cells sorted by flow cytometry, the proportion of B-CD19+ cells with SCL was significantly higher (range: 88-96%) than that observed in T-CD3+ cells (range: 2-6%) (P = 0.008). We conclude that SCL has to be considered as a clonal aberration in CLL that may participate in the oncogenic process.","['Chapiro, Elise', 'Antony-Debre, Ileana', 'Marchay, Nathalie', 'Parizot, Christophe', 'Lesty, Claude', 'Cung, Hong-Anh', 'Mathis, Stephanie', 'Grelier, Aurore', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Choquet, Sylvain', 'Azgui, Zahia', 'Uzunov, Madalina', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence']","['Chapiro E', 'Antony-Debre I', 'Marchay N', 'Parizot C', 'Lesty C', 'Cung HA', 'Mathis S', 'Grelier A', 'Maloum K', 'Choquet S', 'Azgui Z', 'Uzunov M', 'Leblond V', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Sutton L', 'Davi F', 'Nguyen-Khac F']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France; INSERM U872, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, 6, France; UPMC, Paris, 6, France.""]",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20131130,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aneuploidy', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Sex Chromosome Aberrations']",,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/10/03 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22134 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Mar;53(3):240-7. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22134.

The distinct molecular mechanisms of this receptor are still incompletely understood. The (P)RR is able to interact with different signalling proteins such as promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) and Wnt receptors. Moreover, domains of the (P)RR are essential for V-ATPase activity. V-ATPase- and Wnt-mediated effects imply constitutive, i.e., (pro)renin-independent functions of the (P)RR. Regarding ligand-dependent (P)RR signalling, the role of prorenin glycosylation is currently unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the contribution of constitutive (P)RR activity to its cellular effects and the relevance of prorenin glycosylation on its ligand activity. We were able to demonstrate that high glucose induces (P)RR signal transduction whereas deglycosylation of prorenin abolishes its intrinsic activity in neuronal and epithelial cells. By using siRNA against (P)RR or PLZF as well as the PLZF translocation blocker genistein and the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin, we were able to dissect three distinct sub-pathways downstream of the (P)RR. The V-ATPase function is ligand-independently associated with strong pro-proliferative effects whereas prorenin causes moderate proliferation in vitro. In contrast, PLZF per se [i.e., in the absence of (pro)renin] does not interfere with cell number.","['Kirsch, Sebastian', 'Schrezenmeier, Eva', 'Klare, Sabrina', 'Zaade, Daniela', 'Seidel, Kerstin', 'Schmitz, Jennifer', 'Bernhard, Sarah', 'Lauer, Dilyara', 'Slack, Mark', 'Goldin-Lang, Petra', 'Unger, Thomas', 'Zollmann, Frank S', 'Funke-Kaiser, Heiko']","['Kirsch S', 'Schrezenmeier E', 'Klare S', 'Zaade D', 'Seidel K', 'Schmitz J', 'Bernhard S', 'Lauer D', 'Slack M', 'Goldin-Lang P', 'Unger T', 'Zollmann FS', 'Funke-Kaiser H']","['Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Evotec AG, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'School for Cardiovascular Diseases (CARIM), Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140114,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (ATP6AP2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '116764-51-3 (bafilomycin A)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Macrolides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Peroxisomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3976126,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2014.1624 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2014 Apr;33(4):795-808. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1624.

Elevation of MIF levels in plasma correlates with the severity of inflammatory diseases in humans. Inhibition of MIF or its tautomerase activity ameliorates disease severity by reducing inflammatory responses. In this study, the human single-chain variable fragment (HuScFv) antibody specific to MIF was selected from the human antibody phage display library by using purified recombinant full-length human MIF (rMIF) as the target antigen. Monoclonal HuScFv was produced from phage-transformed bacteria and tested for their binding activities to rMIF by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as to native MIF by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. The HuScFv with highest binding signal to rMIF also inhibited the tautomerase activities of both rMIF and native MIF in human monoblastic leukemia (U937) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mimotope searching and molecular docking concordantly demonstrated that the HuScFv interacted with Lys32 and Ile64 in the MIF tautomerase active site.

Mll2 is bound to bivalent promoters but also to most active promoters, which do not require Mll2 for H3K4me3 or mRNA expression. By contrast, the Set1 complex (Set1C) subunit Cxxc1 is primarily bound to active but not bivalent promoters. This indicates that bivalent promoters rely on Mll2 for H3K4me3 whereas active promoters have more than one bound H3K4 methyltransferase, including Set1C. Removal of Mll1, sister to Mll2, had almost no effect on any promoter unless Mll2 was also removed, indicating functional backup between these enzymes. Except for a subset, loss of H3K4me3 on bivalent promoters did not prevent responsiveness to retinoic acid, thereby arguing against a priming model for bivalency. In contrast, we propose that Mll2 is the pioneer trimethyltransferase for promoter definition in the naive epigenome and that Polycomb group action on bivalent promoters blocks the premature establishment of active, Set1C-bound, promoters.","['Denissov, Sergei', 'Hofemeister, Helmut', 'Marks, Hendrik', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Ciotta, Giovanni', 'Singh, Sukhdeep', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G', 'Stewart, A Francis']","['Denissov S', 'Hofemeister H', 'Marks H', 'Kranz A', 'Ciotta G', 'Singh S', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Stunnenberg HG', 'Stewart AF']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences (NCMLS), Radboud University, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140114,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.102681 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.102681 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2014 Feb;141(3):526-37. doi: 10.1242/dev.102681.

The relative contributions of DNMT inhibition and other off-target effects to their clinical efficacy remain unclear. Data correlating DNA methylation reversal and clinical response have been conflicting. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate so-called off-target effects and their impact on cell survival and differentiation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation analysis. Gene expression analysis was performed using real-time PCR. DNA methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed using JC-1 dye staining. Western blotting was used for quantitative protein expression analysis. RESULTS: 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells. p53 expression was dispensable for DAC-induced apoptosis. DAC induced delayed ROS accumulation in leukemia cells but not in solid tumor cells and p53 expression was dispensable for ROS increase. ROS increase was deoxycytidine kinase dependent, indicating that incorporation of DAC into nuclear DNA is required for ROS generation. ROS accumulation by DAC was caspase-independent and mediated the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Concordantly, ROS scavengers diminished DAC-induced apoptosis. DAC induced the expression of different NADPH oxidase isoforms and upregulated Nox4 protein expression in an ATM-dependent manner, indicating the involvement of DNA damage signaling in Nox4 upregulation. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the importance of mechanisms other than DNA cytosine demethylation in modulating gene expression and suggest investigating the relevance of ROS accumulation to the clinical activity of DAC.","['Fandy, Tamer E', 'Jiemjit, Anchalee', 'Thakar, Manjusha', 'Rhoden, Paulette', 'Suarez, Lauren', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Fandy TE', 'Jiemjit A', 'Thakar M', 'Rhoden P', 'Suarez L', 'Gore SD']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albany College of Pharmacy, Colchester, Vermont; and The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140114,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC4000016,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1453 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1453 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Mar 1;20(5):1249-58. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1453.

Maillard reaction products (MRPs) have antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antibacterial effects though 2,4-bis (p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal (HPB242), a fructose-tyrosine MRP, appears to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, its mechanism of action has not been studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-proliferative effects of 2,4-bis (p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal (HPB242) on two oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines, HN22 and HSC4, through regulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1). RESULTS: HPB242 treatment dramatically reduced the cell growth rate and apoptotic cell morphologies. Sp1 was significantly inhibited by HPB242 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cell cycle regulating proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins, which are known as Sp1 target genes, were altered at the molecular levels. The key important regulators in the cell cycle such as p27 were increased, whereas cell proliferation- and survival-related proteins such as cyclin D1, myeloid leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) and survivin were significantly decreased by HPB242 or suppressed Sp1 levels, however pro-apoptotic proteins caspase3 and PARP were cleaved in HN22 and HSC4. CONCLUSIONS: HPB242 may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent for OSCC for the purpose of treatment and prevention of oral cancer and for the improvement of clinical outcomes.","['Chae, Jung-Il', 'Lee, Raham', 'Cho, Jinhyoung', 'Hong, Jintae', 'Shim, Jung-Hyun']","['Chae JI', 'Lee R', 'Cho J', 'Hong J', 'Shim JH']","['Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Mokpo National University, 1666 Youngsan-ro, Muan-gun, Jeonnam 534-729, Republic of Korea. s1004jh@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140115,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Maillard Reaction', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phenols/*administration & dosage', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",PMC3928619,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-21-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-21-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2014 Jan 15;21:4. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-21-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an oncogenic virus associated with several human malignancies, expresses a variety of latent and lytic proteins able to activate PI3K/AKT pathway, promoting the growth of infected cells and a successful viral infection. RESULTS: We found that KSHV latent infection of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monocytic leukemia patient, resulted in an increase of AKT phoshorylation, not susceptible to bortezomib-induced dephosphorylation, compared to the mock-infected THP-1. Accordingly, THP-1-infected cells displayed increased resistance to the bortezomib cytotoxic effect in comparison to the uninfected cells, which was counteracted by pre-treatment with AKT-specific inhibitors. Finally, AKT hyperactivation by KSHV infection correlated with plasma membrane exposure of glucose transporter GLUT1, particularly evident during bortezomib treatment. GLUT1 membrane trafficking is a characteristic of malignant cells and underlies a change of glucose metabolism that ensures the survival to highly proliferating cells and render these cells highly dependent on glycolysis. GLUT1 membrane trafficking in KSHV-infected THP-1 cells indeed led to increased sensitivity to cell death induced by the glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), further potentiated by its combination with bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS: KSHV confers to the THP-1 infected cells an oncogenic potential by altering the phosphorylation, expression and localization of key molecules that control cell survival and metabolism such as AKT and GLUT1. Such modifications in one hand lead to resistance to cell death induced by some chemotherapeutic drugs such as bortezomib, but on the other hand, offer an Achilles heel, rendering the infected cells more sensitive to other treatments such as AKT or glycolysis inhibitors. These therapeutic strategies can be exploited in the anticancer therapy of KSHV-associated malignancies.","['Gonnella, Roberta', 'Santarelli, Roberta', 'Farina, Antonella', 'Granato, Marisa', ""D'Orazi, Gabriella"", 'Faggioni, Alberto', 'Cirone, Mara']","['Gonnella R', 'Santarelli R', 'Farina A', 'Granato M', ""D'Orazi G"", 'Faggioni A', 'Cirone M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131023,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3874756,2014/01/16 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-32-79 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-32-79 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Oct 23;32:79. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-32-79.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse were 77.7% [standard error (SE) 5.7] and 11.4% (SE 4.4), respectively, for patients with pre-transplant MRD <1 x 10(-4) (68%), versus 30.8% (SE 9.1; P < 0.001) and 61.5% (SE 9.5; P < 0.001), respectively, for those with MRD >/=1 x 10(-4) (32%). Pre-transplant MRD >/=1 x 10(-4) was associated with a 9.2-fold risk of relapse [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.54-23.88; P < 0.001] compared with patients with MRD <1 x 10(-4). Patients who received additional chemotherapy pre-transplant to reduce MRD had a fivefold reduction of risk of failure (hazard ratio 0.19, CI 0.05-0.70, P = 0.01). Patients who experienced MRD positivity post-transplant did not necessarily relapse (5-year EFS 40.3%, SE 9.3), but had a 2.5-fold risk of failure (CI 1.05-5.75; P = 0.04) if any MRD was detected in the first 100 d, which increased to 7.8-fold (CI 2.2-27.78; P = 0.002) if detected after 6 months. Anticipated immunosuppression-tapering according to MRD may have improved outcome, nevertheless all patients with post-transplant MRD >/=1 x 10(-3) ultimately relapsed, regardless of immunosuppression discontinuation or donor-lymphocyte-infusion. In conclusion, MRD before transplantation had the strongest impact on relapse and MRD positivity after transplantation, mostly if detected early and at low levels, did not necessarily imply relapse.

Its restricted expression in normal tissues makes it a promising target for novel immunotherapies aiming to accentuate the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against AML. Here we report a phase I/II clinical trial of subcutaneous peptide vaccination with two separate HLA-A2-binding peptide epitopes derived from WT1, together with a pan-DR binding peptide epitope (PADRE), in Montanide adjuvant. Eight HLA-A2-positive patients with poor risk AML received five vaccination cycles at 3-weekly intervals. The three cohorts received 0.3, 0.6 and 1 mg of each peptide, respectively. In six patients, WT1-specific CTL responses were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays and pWT126/HLA-A*0201 tetramer staining, after ex vivo stimulation with the relevant WT1 peptides. However, re-stimulation of these WT1-specific T cells failed to elicit secondary expansion in all four patients tested, suggesting that the WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells generated following vaccination may be functionally impaired. No correlation was observed between peptide dose, cellular immune response, reduction in WT1 mRNA expression and clinical response.

Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is still among the leading causes of death in childhood cancer, remarkable progress in treatment results has been made with this disease. With current antileukemic therapy, more than 80% of children with ALL can be cured. Antileukemic medications, however, are generally toxic and can cause significant adverse drug reactions. Moreover, some patients have leukemia cell clones that are resistant to conventional antileukemic treatment. Overall, a fifth of children with ALL will not be cured despite intensified therapy, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Pharmacogenomics aims to elucidate functionally relevant genomic determinants for drug disposition and response in order to establish valid pharmacogenomic models that can help to select medications and their dose based on a patient's genetic make-up. This review focuses on investigations that provide important basic insights into ALL pharmacogenomics and/or hold great promise in providing clinically valuable pharmacogenomic models that can help to improve childhood ALL treatment by facilitating appropriate dose individualization, optimal treatment selection and drug discovery.","['Pottier, Nicolas', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Kager, Leo']","['Pottier N', 'Cheok M', 'Kager L']","['EA2679, Faculte de Medecine de Lille, Pole Recherche, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,,,,,2008/05/01 00:00,2008/05/01 00:01,['2014/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1586/17512433.1.3.401 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2008 May;1(3):401-13. doi: 10.1586/17512433.1.3.401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its high morbidity rate, early diagnosis and appropriate medical therapy is essential. METHODS: The article highlights normal blood alterations like anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis and advanced diagnostic aids like flow cytometry, special staining as a diagnostic modality as well as for prognostic information in acute leukaemia, particularly as a tool for assigning lineage and facilitating further pathologic classification which may be helpful in influencing treatment strategies. RESULTS: On clinical examination the case presented with features of inflammatory gingival enlargement with presence of local deposits and calculus. Routine blood examination anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with haemoglobin 5.6 gm% and total leukocyte count of 1,12,000 / cu mm suggestive of leukaemia. Myeloperoxidase and leukocyte nonspecific esterase (NSE) special stain were used which showed presence of myeloblasts in the peripheral smear suggestive of acute myelocytic leukaemia. Flow cytometry were done which further helped in interpretation of these cells which showed to be strongly positive for CD45, CD13, CD14, and anti HLADR and moderately positive for CD4, CD34 and Anti MPO confirming to be case of AML-M4 with 57.73% gating. CONCLUSIONS: Fact that gingival alterations are sometimes the first manifestations of the disease implies that dental professionals must be sufficiently familiarized with the clinical manifestations of systemic diseases. The timely referral by the general dentist for a suspicious lesion provided an early diagnosis and early intervention reducing the patient morbidity.","['Reenesh, Mechery', 'Munishwar, Singh', 'Rath, Saroj Kumar']","['Reenesh M', 'Munishwar S', 'Rath SK']","['Division of Periodontology, Armed Forces Medical College Pune India.', 'Division of Periodontology, Armed Forces Medical College Pune India.', 'Department of Dental Surgery, Armed Forces Medical College Pune India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20121001,Lithuania,J Oral Maxillofac Res,Journal of oral & maxillofacial research,101552108,,,,PMC3886083,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5037/jomr.2012.3305 [doi]', 'v3n3e5ht [pii]']",epublish,J Oral Maxillofac Res. 2012 Oct 1;3(3):e5. doi: 10.5037/jomr.2012.3305. eCollection 2012.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'gingival hyperplasia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe neutropenia and other cytopenias are common features in patients with T-LGL leukemia and may cause infections, thus representing a major cause of morbidity in this disease. Immunosuppressive therapy with low-dose regimes of methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids or cyclosporine A is the treatment of choice. Amongst the variety of T-LGL leukemia complications, oral manifestations such as ulcers have been rarely reported. The purpose of this paper is to report a case of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia with oral manifestations and to discuss their pathogenesis and management. METHODS: In the present case, a 65 year old female with a two-month history of diagnosed T-LGL leukemia presented with oral lesions, including ulcerations on the ventral tongue and soft palate as well as swollen, erythematous and ulcerated gingiva. The patient was under treatment with methotrexate, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin. RESULTS: Considering patients' medical history and clinical appearance of the lesions, a clinical diagnosis of a neutropenic ulcer of the tongue was established. The oral lesions resolved after treatment with antibiotics, topical steroids and antiseptics combined with improvement of the hematological condition. The pertinent literature related to T-LGL leukemia ethiopathology, diagnostics and treatment was discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia should be included in the list of lymphoproliferative disorders, which may present with oral manifestations as a result of the disease and its treatment complications.","['Arvanitidou, Ioanna-Eirini', 'Nikitakis, Nikolaos G', 'Sklavounou, Alexandra']","['Arvanitidou IE', 'Nikitakis NG', 'Sklavounou A']","['Department of Oral Pathology and Medicine, School of Dentistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Greece.', 'Department of Oral Pathology and Medicine, School of Dentistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Greece.', 'Department of Oral Pathology and Medicine, School of Dentistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Greece.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20111001,Lithuania,J Oral Maxillofac Res,Journal of oral & maxillofacial research,101552108,,,,PMC3886074,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5037/jomr.2011.2304 [doi]', 'v2n3e4ht [pii]']",epublish,J Oral Maxillofac Res. 2011 Oct 1;2(3):e4. doi: 10.5037/jomr.2011.2304. eCollection 2011.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia', 'acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis', 'methotrexate.', 'neutropenia', 'oral ulcer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to report the outcome of a 9 years old girl with diagnosed juvenile ossifying fibroma treatment. METHODS: A 9 years old girl presented with a 6 x 8 cm sized hard fixed tumour on right ramus and corpus of the mandible. On the radiological examination tumour showed an irregular but well bordered, unilocular and expansive lesion on the right corpus and ramus of the mandible. There was no teeth displacement or teeth root resorbtion. Microscopically, the tumour had trabeculae, fibrillary osteoid and woven bone. After the clinical, radiological (panoramic radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and histologic analysis it was diagnosed juvenile ossifying fibroma. In the history of the patient there has been an acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the remission for 3 years. RESULTS: Because of large size of mandibular tumour, resultant expansion and destruction of mandibular cortex, the patient underwent right hemimandibulectomy using transmandibular approach. There was no recurrence or complications for two years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although juvenile ossifying fibroma is an uncommon clinical entity, its aggressive local behaviour and high recurrence rate means that it is important to make an early diagnosis, apply the appropriate treatment and, especially, follow-up the patient over the long-term.","['Keles, Bahar', 'Duran, Mutlu', 'Uyar, Yavuz', 'Azimov, Ahmet', 'Demirkan, Abdullah', 'Esen, Haci Hasan']","['Keles B', 'Duran M', 'Uyar Y', 'Azimov A', 'Demirkan A', 'Esen HH']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Meram Medical Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya Turkey.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Meram Medical Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya Turkey.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, SSK Okmeydani Education Hospital, Istanbul Turkey.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Meram Medical Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya Turkey.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Meram Medical Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Meram Medical Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100701,Lithuania,J Oral Maxillofac Res,Journal of oral & maxillofacial research,101552108,,,,PMC3886046,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5037/jomr.2010.1205 [doi]', 'v1n2e5ht [pii]']",epublish,J Oral Maxillofac Res. 2010 Jul 1;1(2):e5. doi: 10.5037/jomr.2010.1205. eCollection 2010.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['lymphocytic leukemia.', 'mandibular diseases', 'mandibular neoplasms', 'oral surgery', 'ossifying fibroma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and other signals, ABL is activated to stimulate cell proliferation or differentiation, survival or death, retraction, or migration. ABL also regulates specialized functions such as antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes, synapse formation in neurons, and bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. Although discovered as the proto-oncogene from which the Abelson leukemia virus derived its Gag-v-Abl oncogene, recent results have linked ABL kinase activation to neuronal degeneration. This body of knowledge on ABL seems confusing because it does not fit the one-gene-one-function paradigm. Without question, ABL capabilities are encoded by its gene sequence and that molecular blueprint designs this kinase to be regulated by subcellular location-dependent interactions with inhibitors and substrate activators. Furthermore, ABL shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm where it binds DNA and actin--two biopolymers with fundamental roles in almost all biological processes. Taken together, the cumulated results from analyses of ABL structure-function, ABL mutant mouse phenotypes, and ABL substrates suggest that this tyrosine kinase does not have its own agenda but that, instead, it has evolved to serve a variety of tissue-specific and context-dependent biological functions.","['Wang, Jean Y J']",['Wang JY'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20140113,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3993570,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01454-13 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01454-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2014 Apr;34(7):1188-97. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01454-13.

RS occurs in approximately 2% to 10% of CLL patients during the course of their disease, with a transformation rate of 0.5% to 1% per year. A combination of germline genetic characteristics, clinical features (eg, advanced Rai stage), biologic (zeta-associated protein-70(+), CD38(+), CD49d(+)) and somatic genetic (del17p13.1 or del11q23.1) characteristics of CLL B cells, and certain CLL therapies are associated with higher risk of RS. Recent studies have also identified the crucial role of CDKN2A loss, TP53 disruption, C-MYC activation, and NOTCH1 mutations in the transformation from CLL to RS. An excisional lymph node biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of RS; a (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan can help inform the optimal site for biopsy. Approximately 80% of DLBCL cases in patients with CLL are clonally related to the underlying CLL, and the median survival for these patients is approximately 1 year. In contrast, the remaining 20% of patients have a clonally unrelated DLBCL and have a prognosis similar to that of de novo DLBCL. For patients with clonally related DLBCL, induction therapy with either an anthracycline- or platinum-based regimen is the standard approach. Postremission stem cell transplantation should be considered for appropriate patients. This article summarizes our approach to the clinical management of CLL patients who develop RS.","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Parikh SA', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",PMC3954047,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35887-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-11-516229 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 13;123(11):1647-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-11-516229.

Imaging methods that can detect apoptosis may be able to assess treatment response earlier than typical tumor volume measurements. In this paper, a wide range of diffusion experiments and a simple model of diffusion in tissues were used to probe the microstructural effects of apoptosis. Experiments were conducted on acute myeloid leukemia cell pellets, where apoptosis was induced by treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Seventy-two hours following cisplatin treatment, pulsed and oscillating gradient diffusion measurements were utilized to assess effects across a broad range of structural scales. The presence of apoptosis, which was histologically confirmed by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase UTP nick end labelling) staining, significantly changed diffusion properties. To describe these changes, the data were fit to the parallel plane model, which characterizes the effects of restricted diffusion in terms of three parameters: d, the restricted size, Dfree , the intrinsic, free diffusion coefficient of the solvent, and Drest , the long time or ""restricted"" diffusion coefficient. Apoptotic samples exhibited significant decreases in parameters d and Dfree and a significant increase in Drest . These changes appear consistent with the established morphological effects of apoptosis. In particular, the decrease in d may be a result of the combined effects of cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation and membrane blebbing, the decrease in Dfree may relate to cytosolic condensation, while the increase in Drest can be attributed to increased membrane permeability and extracellular volume fraction. By non-invasively detecting apoptosis, the methods reported in this study have the potential to improve upon current MRI methods for monitoring therapeutic response. Furthermore, these methods may offer sufficient specificity to differentiate between apoptosis and other modes of cell death, such as oncosis or necrosis.","['Portnoy, S', 'Fichtner, N D', 'Dziegielewski, C', 'Stanisz, M P', 'Stanisz, G J']","['Portnoy S', 'Fichtner ND', 'Dziegielewski C', 'Stanisz MP', 'Stanisz GJ']","['Department of Imaging Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,England,NMR Biomed,NMR in biomedicine,8915233,['0 (Spin Labels)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Spin Labels']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/nbm.3070 [doi]'],ppublish,NMR Biomed. 2014 Apr;27(4):371-80. doi: 10.1002/nbm.3070.

It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic-, accelerated-, or blast-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy (imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) [USA] or for a small subpopulation of these patients for whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options (EU). In a multinational pivotal trial (n = 547), bosutinib treatment resulted in a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) at 24 weeks in one-third of all treated patients with imatinib-resistant chronic-phase CML who had no previous exposure to any TKIs other than imatinib (primary endpoint), with similar results observed in chronic-phase CML patients who were intolerant of imatinib and naive to all other TKIs. MCyRs were also seen in more than one-quarter of evaluable patients with chronic-phase CML previously treated with multiple TKIs. Most of the patients with chronic-phase CML achieved a complete hematologic response with bosutinib and some patients with advanced phases of CML achieved an overall hematologic response. Responses were seen irrespective of the type of BCR-ABL mutation at baseline, except T315I. Bosutinib had a manageable tolerability profile in the pivotal trial, with </=21 % of patients with chronic-phase CML discontinuing the treatment because of adverse events. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event but was generally manageable, with only few patients discontinuing the treatment because of diarrhea. Therefore, bosutinib is a useful TKI option for patients with Ph+ CML in second-line or greater settings.","['Syed, Yahiya Y', 'McCormack, Paul L', 'Plosker, Greg L']","['Syed YY', 'McCormack PL', 'Plosker GL']","['Adis, 41 Centorian Drive, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, North Shore, 0754, Auckland, New Zealand, demail@springer.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/10/21 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40259-013-0082-x [doi]'],ppublish,BioDrugs. 2014 Feb;28(1):107-20. doi: 10.1007/s40259-013-0082-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In summary, these data suggest that a certain amount of in vivo T-cell depletion can be safely used in the conditioning of AML patients in CR1 given PBSC after chemotherapy-based RIC.","['Baron, F', 'Labopin, M', 'Blaise, D', 'Lopez-Corral, L', 'Vigouroux, S', 'Craddock, C', 'Attal, M', 'Jindra, P', 'Goker, H', 'Socie, G', 'Chevallier, P', 'Browne, P', 'Sandstedt, A', 'Duarte, R F', 'Nagler, A', 'Mohty, M']","['Baron F', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Vigouroux S', 'Craddock C', 'Attal M', 'Jindra P', 'Goker H', 'Socie G', 'Chevallier P', 'Browne P', 'Sandstedt A', 'Duarte RF', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', '1] Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, Hospital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France [2] EBMT ALWP Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France [3] Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France [4] INSERM UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'Hematology, CHU de Marseille, Marseille, France.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital and School of Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Hematology, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Charles University Medical School and Teaching Hospital, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Hematology, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', ""Hope Directorate, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, UK."", 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', ""ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, l'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology Division, Sheba medical Center, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', '1] Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, Hospital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France [2] EBMT ALWP Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France [3] Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France [4] INSERM UMRs 938, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140113,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2013204 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2013.204 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2014 Mar;49(3):389-96. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2013.204.

All 54 patients (diagnosis: B-CLL n=13, indolent lymphoma n=12, aggressive lymphoma n=13, transformed lymphoma n=16) received conditioning with fludarabine and CY between July 2001 and November 2010. They underwent allo-SCT because of relapse after auto-SCT or because no other therapy could lead to a meaningful remission. Patients received an unmanipulated peripheral blood stem-cell graft. Median follow-up was 67 months. Thirty-two patients had received rituximab. Immediately after transplantation, remission status had improved in 21 patients, all without DLI. During the follow-up six additional patients achieved CR without further therapy. Four-year OS (EFS) was 46% (46%) for B-CLL, 83% (75%) for indolent lymphoma, 69% (55%) for aggressive lymphoma and 74% (67%) for transformed lymphoma (P=0.28 (P=0.54)). Forty two percent developed acute GVHD, 68% chronic GVHD (16% limited, 52% extensive). Previous auto-SCT did not influence OS, while acute GVHD did. Two-year non-relapse mortality was 16%. In conclusion, reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine-CY is feasible and effective for both indolent and aggressive lymphoid malignancies, even after previous auto-SCT. Because of the excellent anti-B-cell/lymphoma activity fludarabine-CY decreases tumor load, gaining time for the development of a graft versus lymphoma effect.","['Wondergem, M J', 'Dijkstra, F S', 'Visser, O J', 'Zweegman, S', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Witte, B I', 'Janssen, J J W M']","['Wondergem MJ', 'Dijkstra FS', 'Visser OJ', 'Zweegman S', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Witte BI', 'Janssen JJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140113,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2013221 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2013.221 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2014 Apr;49(4):513-8. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2013.221.

Some patients, generally those who are younger, can be successfully salvaged with second-line chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There is a great need for novel therapies in AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in molecular technology recently identified recurrent mutations including mutations of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and TET2. These mutations represent a major advance in the understanding of leukemogenesis and prognosis, and have enabled the development of targeted therapies. SUMMARY: Improved knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of AML has allowed development of therapies targeting epigenetic modulation, intracellular signaling pathways, prosurvival proteins, and the tumor microenvironment.","['Dinner, Shira N', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Altman, Jessica K']","['Dinner SN', 'Giles FJ', 'Altman JK']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and Northwestern Medicine Developmental Therapeutics Institute, Robert H.

With the advent of new-generation whole-genome sequencing, many consistent chromosomal abnormalities have been described together with putative driver and passenger mutations. The multiple genetic changes required in mouse models to assess the interrelationship of abnormalities and other mutations are severe limitations. Here, we show that sequential gene targeting of embryonic stem cells can be used to yield progenitor cells to generate chimeric offspring carrying all the genetic changes needed for cell-specific cancer. Illustrating the technology, we show that MLL-ENL fusion is sufficient for lethal leukocytosis and proof of genome integrity comes from germline transmission of the sequentially targeted alleles. This accelerated technology leads to a reduction in mouse numbers (contributing significantly to the 3Rs), allows fluorescence tagging of cancer-initiating cells, and provides a flexible platform for interrogating the interaction of chromosomal abnormalities with mutations.","['Chambers, Jennifer S', 'Tanaka, Tomoyuki', 'Brend, Tim', 'Ali, Hanif', 'Geisler, Nicola J', 'Khazin, Leah', 'Cigudosa, Juan C', 'Dear, T Neil', 'MacLennan, Kenneth', 'Rabbitts, Terence H']","['Chambers JS', 'Tanaka T', 'Brend T', 'Ali H', 'Geisler NJ', 'Khazin L', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Dear TN', 'MacLennan K', 'Rabbitts TH']","[""Authors' Affiliations: MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford; Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St. James's University Hospital, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom; and Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro, Madrid, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukocytosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/06/04 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-1783 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1783 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Mar 1;74(5):1588-97. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1783.

Inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) has emerged as a promising strategy to induce cell death in malignant cells. We have previously reported that the HDAC inhibitor MGCD0103 induces CLL cell death by activating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Here, we show that MGCD0103 decreases the autophagic flux in primary CLL cells. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, together with the activation of caspases, and to a minor extent CAPN1, resulting in cleavage of autophagy components, were involved in MGCD0103-mediated inhibition of autophagy. In addition, MGCD0103 directly modulated the expression of critical autophagy genes at the transcriptional level that may contribute to autophagy impairment. Besides, we demonstrate that autophagy is a pro-survival mechanism in CLL whose disruption potentiates cell death induced by anticancer molecules including HDAC and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In particular, our data highlight the therapeutic potential of MGCD0103 as not only an inducer of apoptosis but also an autophagy suppressor in both combination regimens with molecules like flavopiridol, known to induce protective autophagy in CLL cells, or as an alternative to circumvent undesired immunomodulatory effects seen in the clinic with conventional autophagy inhibitors.","['El-Khoury, V', 'Pierson, S', 'Szwarcbart, E', 'Brons, N H C', 'Roland, O', 'Cherrier-De Wilde, S', 'Plawny, L', 'Van Dyck, E', 'Berchem, G']","['El-Khoury V', 'Pierson S', 'Szwarcbart E', 'Brons NH', 'Roland O', 'Cherrier-De Wilde S', 'Plawny L', 'Van Dyck E', 'Berchem G']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', '1] Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg [2] Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140114,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'A6GWB8T96J (mocetinostat)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.52 (CAPN1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calpain/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4131250,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/10/08 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201419 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.19 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Aug;28(8):1636-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.19.

We encountered 3 patients with CLL/SLL (one 59-y-old man and 2 women aged 56 and 66 y) who developed T-cell lymphomas. Both women developed ALK anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), whereas the man developed CD8 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. All 3 T-cell lymphomas expressed granzyme B and perforin, indicating a cytotoxic immunophenotype. In 1 case, the first presentation was a lymph nodal composite lymphoma. In the other 2 cases, the T-cell lymphomas arose <1 year after the diagnosis of CLL/SLL and were identified in a lymph node in one case and in the spleen in the other. The patient with a composite lymphoma (SLL/ALK ALCL) was treated and was free of disease at last follow-up, whereas the other 2 patients succumbed to their disease, 1 month and 7 months after the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas rarely occur in CLL/SLL patients. On the basis of our small series, those with a cytotoxic phenotype appear to be more common in this setting. The occurrence of ALK ALCL in 2 older patients was especially surprising and suggested that CLL/SLL may have played a role in the development of ALCL.","['Boyer, Daniel F', 'Lindeman, Neal I', 'Harris, Nancy Lee', 'Ferry, Judith Ann']","['Boyer DF', 'Lindeman NI', 'Harris NL', 'Ferry JA']","[""*Massachusetts General Hospital daggerBrigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Granzymes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/chemistry/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/chemistry/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Perforin/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000140 [doi]', '00000478-201402000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2014 Feb;38(2):279-88. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published series of ATLLs seen at a United States medical institution are rare. We present the features of 4 ATLLs diagnosed at our North American tertiary care medical center from 1990 to 2012. Despite the absence of a history of origin from an endemic region, all our ATLLs demonstrated evidence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement by ATLL was uncommon in our series, and represented only 1.6% (1/64) of all CNS B-cell or T-cell lymphomas diagnosed over a 20+ year period at our institution. Review of the medical literature reveals that the majority of CNS-involved ATLLs present with the lymphoma or acute subtype, and complete remission is difficult to achieve in these cases. CNS involvement frequently occurs with a systemic disease, which carries an aggressive clinical course with poor prognosis. In addition, CNS involvement by ATLL can be the initial presentation or seen with relapsed disease, can be the only site or be associated with other tissue sites of involvement, and may manifest with variable clinical signs/symptoms. Our retrospective study reveals that ATLLs are rare mature T-cell lymphomas in a native North American population, but the clinical and histopathologic features of ATLLs from this nonendemic region are similar to those seen from other endemic regions. Early recognition of these rare ATLLs involving uncommon sites, such as the CNS, will help optimize treatment for these infrequent mature T-cell lymphomas.","['Hsi, Andy C', 'Kreisel, Friederike H', 'Frater, John L', 'Nguyen, TuDung T']","['Hsi AC', 'Kreisel FH', 'Frater JL', 'Nguyen TT']","['Department of Pathology & Immunology, Division of Anatomic Pathology, Washington University, St Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/chemistry/genetics/*pathology/therapy/virology', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Missouri', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000109 [doi]', '00000478-201402000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2014 Feb;38(2):245-56. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Ritonavir induced cytotoxicity and PS at clinically achievable concentrations, and induced synergistic PS-triggered apoptosis with bortezomib. Saquinavir, nelfinavir and lopinavir were likewise cytotoxic against primary AML cells, triggered PS-induced apoptosis, inhibited AKT-phosphorylation and showed synergistic cytotoxicity with bortezomib and carfilzomib at low micromolar concentrations. Exclusively nelfinavir inhibited intracellular proteasome activity, including the beta2 proteasome activity that is not targeted by bortezomib/carfilzomib. CONCLUSIONS: Of the nine currently approved HIV-PI, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir and lopinavir can sensitize AML primary cells for proteasome inhibitor treatment at low micromolar concentrations and may therefore be tested clinically toward a proteotoxic stress targeted therapy of AML.","['Kraus, Marianne', 'Muller-Ide, Hendrik', 'Ruckrich, Thomas', 'Bader, Jurgen', 'Overkleeft, Herman', 'Driessen, Christoph']","['Kraus M', 'Muller-Ide H', 'Ruckrich T', 'Bader J', 'Overkleeft H', 'Driessen C']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Cantonal Hospital, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Cantonal Hospital, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Leiden Institute of Chemistry, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Cantonal Hospital, St. Gallen, Switzerland; Department of Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Germany.

Similarly, blockade of the multidrug-resistance protein 1 (MDR1) can overcome efflux-mediated resistance. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is essential for the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair pathway. NU7441 is a potent DNA-PK inhibitor (IC50=14nM) that is used widely to study the effects of DNA-PK inhibition in vitro. In growth inhibition studies, 1muM NU7441 sensitised vincristine-resistant CCRF-CEM VCR/R leukaemia cells (1200-fold resistant) to a range of MDR1 substrates, including doxorubicin (8-fold, p=0.03), vincristine (14-fold, p=0.01) and etoposide (63-fold, p=0.02), compared with 1.4-fold (p=0.02), 2.2-fold (p=0.04) and 3.6-fold (p=0.01) sensitisation, respectively, in parental CCRF-CEM cells. This difference in NU7441 sensitivity was confirmed in another two parental and MDR1-overexpressing cell line pairs. A doxorubicin fluorescence assay showed that in MDR1-overexpressing canine kidney MDCKII-MDR1 cells, 1muM NU7441 increased doxorubicin nuclear fluorescence 16-fold. NU7441 and 3 structurally related compounds (NU7742 (an NU7441 analogue that does not inhibit DNA-PK - IC50>10muM), DRN1 (DNA-PK-inhibitory atropisomeric NU7441 derivative - IC50=2nM) and DRN2 (DNA-PK non-inhibitory atropisomeric NU7441 derivative - IC50=7muM)) all increased intracellular vincristine accumulation in the CCRF-CEM VCR/R cells to a level similar to verapamil, as measured by LC-MS. This paper demonstrates that NU7441 is a dual DNA-PK and MDR1 inhibitor, and this extends the therapeutic potential of the compound when used in combination with MDR substrates.","['Mould, Emily', 'Berry, Philip', 'Jamieson, David', 'Hill, Christopher', 'Cano, Celine', 'Tan, Niu', 'Elliott, Sarah', 'Durkacz, Barbara', 'Newell, David', 'Willmore, Elaine']","['Mould E', 'Berry P', 'Jamieson D', 'Hill C', 'Cano C', 'Tan N', 'Elliott S', 'Durkacz B', 'Newell D', 'Willmore E']","[""Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University, Paul O'Gorman Building, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells were differentiated into the macrophage phenotype by incubation with oxLDL in the absence or presence of beta-glucan. beta-glucan attenuated CD86 and CD80 expression and simultaneously reduced secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Western blot analysis showed that oxLDL treatment induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. However, beta-glucan inhibited p38 MAPK activation. In experiments with monocytes derived from healthy donors, beta-glucan inhibited IL-8, IL-12 and TNF-alpha production. The anti-inflammatory effects of beta-glucan were also observed in atherosclerotic plaque cells. CONCLUSIONS: beta-glucan inhibited oxLDL-induced pro-inflammatory effects in macrophages via regulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

We previously showed that bortezomib-resistant human leukemia cell lines expressed significantly lower levels of immunoproteasome at the expense of constitutive proteasomes, which harbored point mutations in exon 2 of the PSMB5 gene encoding the beta5 subunit. Here we investigated whether up-regulation of immunoproteasomes by exposure to interferon-gamma restores sensitivity to bortezomib in myeloma and leukemia cell lines with acquired resistance to bortezomib. METHODS: RPMI-8226 myeloma, THP1 monocytic/macrophage and CCRF-CEM (T) parental cells and sub lines with acquired resistance to bortezomib were exposed to Interferon-gamma for 24-48 h where after the effects on proteasome subunit expression and activity were measured, next to sensitivity measurements to proteasome inhibitors bortezomib, carfilzomib, and the immunoproteasome selective inhibitor ONX 0914. At last, siRNA knockdown experiments of beta5i and beta1i were performed to identify the contribution of these subunits to sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. Statistical significance of the differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Interferon-gamma exposure markedly increased immunoproteasome subunit mRNA to a significantly higher level in bortezomib-resistant cells (up to 30-fold, 10-fold, and 6-fold, in beta1i, beta5i, and beta2i, respectively) than in parental cells. These increases were paralleled by elevated immunoproteasome protein levels and catalytic activity, as well as HLA class-I. Moreover, interferon-gamma exposure reinforced sensitization of bortezomib-resistant tumor cells to bortezomib and carfilzomib, but most prominently to ONX 0914, as confirmed by cell growth inhibition studies, proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis, activation of PARP cleavage and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. This sensitization was abrogated by siRNA silencing of beta5i but not by beta1i silencing, prior to pulse exposure to interferon-gamma. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of beta5i subunit expression is a major determinant in acquisition of bortezomib-resistance and enhancement of its proteasomal assembly after induction by interferon-gamma facilitates restoration of sensitivity in bortezomib-resistant leukemia cells towards bortezomib and next generation (immuno) proteasome inhibitors.","['Niewerth, Denise', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'van Meerloo, Johan', 'Kirk, Christopher J', 'Anderl, Janet', 'Blank, Jonathan L', 'van de Ven, Peter M', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Niewerth D', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Assaraf YG', 'van Meerloo J', 'Kirk CJ', 'Anderl J', 'Blank JL', 'van de Ven PM', 'Zweegman S', 'Jansen G', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.cloos@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (PR-957)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",PMC3896789,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/01/15 06:00'],"['2013/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-7 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jan 13;7:7. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have analysed OSM and its receptors in livers with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and studied the factors that regulate this system. METHODS: OSM, OSM receptors and OSM-target molecules were studied by immunohistochemistry and/or qPCR analysis in livers from CHC patients and controls. We determined the production of OSM by CD40L-stimulated antigen presenting cells (APC) and its biological effects on HuH7 cells containing HCV replicon (HuH7 Core-3'). RESULTS: OSM was upregulated in livers with CHC and its production was mapped to CD11c+ cells. OSM levels correlated directly with inflammatory activity and CD40L expression. In vitro studies showed that OSM is released by APC upon interaction with activated CD4+ T cells in a CD40L-dependent manner. Culture of HuH7 Core-3' cells with supernatant from CD40L-stimulated APC repressed HCV replication and induced IL-7 and IL-15Ralpha. These effects were dampened by antibodies blocking OSM or gp130 and by silencing OSMRbeta. In CHC livers OSMRbeta and LIFR were significantly downregulated and their values correlated with those of OSM-induced molecules. Experiments in HuH7 cells showed that impaired STAT3 signaling and exposure to TGFbeta1, two findings in CHC, are factors involved in repressing OSMRbeta and LIFR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: OSM is a cytokine possessing vigorous antiviral and immunostimulatory properties which is released by APC upon interaction with CD40L present on activated CD4+ T cells. In livers with CHC, OSM is overexpressed but its biological activity appears to be hampered because of downregulation of its receptor subunits.","['Larrea, Esther', 'Echeverria, Itziar', 'Riezu-Boj, Jose-I', 'Aldabe, Rafael', 'Guembe, Laura', 'Sola, Iosu', 'Civeira, Maria Pilar', 'Sarobe, Pablo', 'Prieto, Jesus']","['Larrea E', 'Echeverria I', 'Riezu-Boj JI', 'Aldabe R', 'Guembe L', 'Sola I', 'Civeira MP', 'Sarobe P', 'Prieto J']","['Division of Hepatology and Gene Therapy, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

However, circulating adiponectin level is inversely related with body weight, especially visceral fat accumulation. The mechanism of this paradoxical relation remains obscure. Low circulating adiponectin concentrations (hypoadiponectinemia; <4 mug/mL) are associated with a variety of diseases, including dysmetabolism (type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hyperuricemia), atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease), sleep apnea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, gastritis and gastro-esophageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, pancreatitis, osteoporosis, and cancer (endometrial cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer). On the other hand, hyperadiponectinemia is associated with cardiac, renal and pulmonary diseases.

METHODS: The efficacy, overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events were evaluated in 198 patients on these two therapies from February 2002 to December 2012 at our hospital. One hundred and fifteen cases in imatinib group (n = 115) received imatinib at an initial daily dose of 400 mg and then dose was adjusted according to blood routine test and therapy response. All patients were evaluated for hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses every 1-3 months. The allo-HSCT group (n = 83) received myeloablative preconditioning regimen and methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporine A (CsA) were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) partially plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG). The engraftment evidence and evolution of cytogenetic and molecular response was conventionally detected after allo-HSCT. RESULTS: In imatinib group, 59 of 86 (68.6%) cases achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in the 12 months after therapy, while 67 of 70 (95.7%) cases achieved CCyR in allo-HSCT group. The relapse rates of two groups were 14.8% (17/115) , 12.3% (10/81) respectively. The adverse reaction of imatinib in imatinib group was obviously much more tolerable for patients compared with frequently occurred GVHD and infection in allo-HSCT group. The 10-year cumulative overall survival (OS) rate was 93.9% in imatinib group and 77.1% in allo-HSCT group (P = 0.015). And the 10-year cumulative progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 86.1% in imatinib group versus 88.0% in allo-HSCT group (P = 0.508) . For Sokal rating stratified analysis, the cumulative OS rates of two groups were 96.4% and 68.0% (P = 0.049) for intermediate-risk patients, 92.6% and 57.1% (P = 0.017) for high-risk patients while the cumulative PFS rates of two groups were 89.3% and 88.0% for intermediate-risk patients (P = 0.942), 70.4% and 85.7% for high-risk patients (P = 0.405). The rates of OS and PFS were not significantly different for low-risk patients.

Cancer- and concomitant chemotherapy-related anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients with hematologic malignancy have complicated the evaluation of hematologic toxicity related to new drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the hematologic toxicity of VSLI 2.25 mg/m(2) administered every 14 (cohort 1) or 7 (cohort 2) days in 54 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, a cancer not known to involve the bone marrow. RESULTS: Cohort 2 received a greater median number of VSLI doses (6 vs. 4) within a shorter median period (5.7 vs. 8.7 weeks), resulting in a larger median cumulative exposure (22.6 vs. 17.7 mg) and near doubling of the median dose density (2.2 vs. 4.0 mg/wk) compared with cohort 1. Despite greater VSLI exposure and dose density, cohort 2 had a lower median decrease from baseline in the neutrophil count and a greater increase from baseline in the platelet count compared with cohort 1. Hematologic adverse events (AEs) were uncommon and mostly grade 1 or 2 in severity. No grade 4 hematologic AEs developed. CONCLUSION: VSLI at its approved dose resulted in a low incidence of clinically meaningful hematologic toxicity. A near doubling of the median dose density did not have an identifiable effect on the reported incidence and severity of hematologic AEs. VSLI could be well suited for use combined with myelosuppresive drugs and for patients unable to tolerate peripheral blood cytopenia.","['Deitcher, Olivia R', 'Glaspy, John', 'Gonzalez, Rene', 'Sato, Takami', 'Bedikian, Agop Y', 'Segarini, Karen', 'Silverman, Jeffrey', 'Deitcher, Steven R']","['Deitcher OR', 'Glaspy J', 'Gonzalez R', 'Sato T', 'Bedikian AY', 'Segarini K', 'Silverman J', 'Deitcher SR']","['Talon Therapeutics, Inc, South San Francisco, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO.', 'Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Talon Therapeutics, Inc, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Talon Therapeutics, Inc, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Talon Therapeutics, Inc, South San Francisco, CA.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of HR-MMs in 3 transplantation time periods. We confirmed that the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD in the HR-MM group was significantly higher than that in the low-risk (LR) MM group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74; P < .0001) in the early time period (1993 to 2001). However, the difference in the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD between the HR-MM and LR-MM groups was not statistically significant (HR, 1.06; P = .85 and HR, .40; P = .21, respectively) in the mid (2002 to 2007) and late (2008 to 2011) time periods. Similarly, survival in the HR-MM group was significantly inferior to that in the LR-MM group (HR, 1.46; P = .019) in the early time period, whereas the difference in survival between the 2 groups was not statistically significant in the mid and late time periods (HR, 1.06; P = .75 and HR, .82; P = .58, respectively). In conclusion, the adverse impact of HR-MM has become less significant over time. Unrelated transplantation with a single HR-MM could be a viable option in the absence of a matched unrelated donor or an unrelated donor with a single LR-MM.","['Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Fuji, Shigeo', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Ichinohe, Tastuo', 'Takanashi, Minoko', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Sao, Hiroshi', 'Kobayashi, Naoki', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Sawada, Akihisa', 'Mori, Shinichiro']","['Kanda Y', 'Kanda J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Fuji S', 'Maeda Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Takanashi M', 'Ohashi K', 'Fukuda T', 'Miyamura K', 'Mori T', 'Sao H', 'Kobayashi N', 'Iwato K', 'Sawada A', 'Mori S']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.

However, little is known about the effect and molecular basis of As2O3 in inducing HIV-1 expression in latently infected cells. Using the Jurkat T cell model of HIV-1 latency, we found that As2O3 activated latent HIV-1 replication with a similar potency to valproic acid (VPA) and did so in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also found that As2O3 synergistically reactivated latent HIV-1 transcription with prostratin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or VPA. Moreover, we provide evidence indicating that As2O3-induced HIV-1 activation involves the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway.

It represents a central systems biology hub that reverberates into countless other pathways with more specialized roles in specialized cell types throughout the body. I have spent 25 years of research on this core biochemical pathway with several unanticipated iterations that led me from Down syndrome to congenital heart defects to leukemia and finally to autism about 12 years ago. Figure 1 provides an overview of the three interdependent pathways involved in folate-dependent methionine ""transmethylation"" and ""transsulfuration."" Methionine is necessary for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl donor for all cellular methylation reactions. It is also the major precursor for cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for glutathione synthesis linking transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways. Methionine levels can be negatively affected by genetic and environmental factors that reduce folate availability and/or oxidative inhibition of the methionine synthase enzyme. Because these three metabolic pathways are mutually interdependent, genetic or environmental perturbation of folate or methionine metabolism will indirectly impact glutathione synthesis, and conversely, alterations in glutathione synthesis will alter flux through pathways of folate and methionine metabolism. This interdependency translates into broader impact on essential cellular functions.","['James, S Jill']",['James SJ'],"[""Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute, Little Rock, United States.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Glob Adv Health Med,Global advances in health and medicine,101584936,,,,PMC3865377,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/01/15 06:01,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7453/gahmj.2013.088 [doi]', 'gahmj.2013.088 [pii]']",ppublish,Glob Adv Health Med. 2013 Nov;2(6):48-51. doi: 10.7453/gahmj.2013.088.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autism', 'folate', 'glutathione', 'metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the LIF-dependent STAT activation and its impact on modulation of trophoblast functions during embryo implantation. LIF is mainly produced by the maternal endometrium at the time of implantation while its receptors are present both on the endometrium and trophoblasts. It might influence blastocyst attachment through STAT3 activation and expression of integrins. After attachment of the blastocyst, trophoblasts undergo proliferation and differentiation into invasive EVTs and non-invasive STBs. Under in vitro conditions, LIF regulates all these processes through activation of STAT- and MAPK-dependent signaling pathways. The observations that LIF and STAT3 knockout mice are infertile further strengthen the notion about the critical involvement of LIF-mediated signaling during embryo implantation. Hence, a better understanding of LIF-STAT signaling would help in improving fertility as use of LIF in in vitro blastocyst culture improves the implanting ability of blastocyst after IVF.","['Suman, Pankaj', 'Malhotra, Sudha Saryu', 'Gupta, Satish Kumar']","['Suman P', 'Malhotra SS', 'Gupta SK']","['Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory; National Institute of Immunology; Aruna Asaf Ali Marg; New Delhi, India.', 'Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory; National Institute of Immunology; Aruna Asaf Ali Marg; New Delhi, India.', 'Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory; National Institute of Immunology; Aruna Asaf Ali Marg; New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130627,United States,JAKSTAT,JAK-STAT,101591376,,,,PMC3876431,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/01/15 06:01,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/jkst.25155 [doi]', '2012JAKS0100 [pii]']",ppublish,JAKSTAT. 2013 Oct 1;2(4):e25155. doi: 10.4161/jkst.25155.

The former translocation, t(3;14)(p13;q32), results in dysregulated expression of FOXP1 juxtaposed with strong regulatory elements of IGH. Thus far, molecular consequences of rare non-IG aberrations of FOXP1 remain undetermined. Here, using molecular cytogenetics and molecular biology studies, we comprehensively analyzed four lymphoma cases with non-IG rearrangements of FOXP1 and compared these with cases harboring t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 and FOXP1-expressing lymphomas with no apparent structural aberrations of the gene. Our study revealed that non-IG rearrangements of FOXP1 are usually acquired during clinical course of various lymphoma subtypes, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and correlate with a poor prognosis. Importantly, these aberrations constantly target the coding region of FOXP1, promiscuously fusing with coding and non-coding gene sequences at various reciprocal breakpoints (2q36, 10q24 and 3q11). The non-IG rearrangements of FOXP1, however, do not generate functional chimeric genes but commonly disrupt the full-length FOXP1 transcript leading to an aberrant expression of N-truncated FOXP1 isoforms (FOXP1(NT)), as shown by QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. In contrast, t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 affects the 5' untranslated region of FOXP1 and results in overexpress the full-length FOXP1 protein (FOXP1(FL)). RNA-sequencing of a few lymphoma cases expressing FOXP1(NT) and FOXP1(FL) detected neither FOXP1-related fusions nor FOXP1 mutations. Further bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data retrieved a set of genes, which may comprise direct or non-direct targets of FOXP1(NT), potentially implicated in disease progression. In summary, our findings point to a dual mechanism through which FOXP1 is implicated in B-cell lymphomagenesis. We hypothesize that the primary t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 activates expression of the FOXP1(FL) protein with potent oncogenic activity, whereas the secondary non-IG rearrangements of FOXP1 promote expression of the FOXP1(NT) proteins, likely driving progression of disease.","['Rouhigharabaei, Leila', 'Finalet Ferreiro, Julio', 'Tousseyn, Thomas', 'van der Krogt, Jo-Anne', 'Put, Natalie', 'Haralambieva, Eugenia', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Maes, Brigitte', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Cools, Jan', 'Wlodarska, Iwona']","['Rouhigharabaei L', 'Finalet Ferreiro J', 'Tousseyn T', 'van der Krogt JA', 'Put N', 'Haralambieva E', 'Graux C', 'Maes B', 'Vicente C', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Cools J', 'Wlodarska I']","['Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Translational Cell and Tissue Research KU Leuven, Department of Pathology UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Mont-Godinne University Hospital, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Virga Jesse Hospital, Hasselt, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium ; Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium ; Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",PMC3887110,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085851 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30496 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 9;9(1):e85851. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085851. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mode of action of TL1A remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of TL1A in a pro-inflammatory setting, using human leukocytes purified from healthy donors. We show that TL1A, together with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, directly induces the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha from leukocytes. Interestingly, TL1A-induced IL-6 was not produced by CD14(+) monocytes. We further show that the produced IL-6 is fully functional, as measured by its ability to signal through the IL-6 receptor, and that the induction of IL-6 is independent of TCR stimulation. Furthermore, the transcription factor PLZF was induced in stimulated cells. These results offer a substantial explanation for the role of TL1A, since TNF-alpha and IL-6 are directly responsible for much of the inflammatory state in many autoimmune diseases.

Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.","['Zwiener, Isabella', 'Frisch, Barbara', 'Binder, Harald']","['Zwiener I', 'Frisch B', 'Binder H']","['Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (CTH), University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany ; Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140108,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcriptome']",PMC3885686,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085150 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30964 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 8;9(1):e85150. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085150. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-15 was discovered in cells transformed by HTLV-1, the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and the human retrovirus that carries the Tax oncogene. We have developed the TAX-LUC mouse model of ATL in which Tax expression drives both malignant transformation and luciferase expression, enabling non-invasive imaging of tumorigenesis in real time. To identify the role of IL-15 in spontaneous development of lymphoma in vivo, an IL-15(-/-) TAX-LUC strain was developed and examined. The absence of IL-15 resulted in aggressive tumor growth and accelerated mortality and demonstrated that IL-15 was not required for Tax-mediated lymphoma but was essential for anti-tumor immunity. Further analysis revealed a unique transcriptional profile in tumor cells that arise in the absence of IL-15 that included a significant increase in the expression of IL-1alpha and IL-1alpha-regulated cytokines. Moreover, anti-IL-1alpha antibodies and an IL-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) were used to interrogate the potential of IL-1alpha targeted therapies in this model. Taken together, these findings identify IL-15 and IL-1alpha as therapeutic targets in lymphoma.","['Rauch, Daniel A', 'Harding, John C', 'Ratner, Lee']","['Rauch DA', 'Harding JC', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140108,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-1alpha)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-1alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Luciferases/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3885672,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085028 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-37427 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 8;9(1):e85028. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085028. eCollection 2014.,,,,"['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For further improving the prognosis evaluation system, we investigated the transcripts levels of PDCD7, FIS1, FAM3A, CA6, APP, KLRF1, ATCAY, GGT5 and Ang2 in 97 AML patients and 30 non-malignant controls, and validated using the published microarray data from 225 cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients treated according to the German AMLCG-1999 protocol. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot were carried out, and clinical data were collected and analyzed. High Ang2 and FIS1 expression discriminated the CR rate of AML patients (62.5% versus 82.9% for Ang2, P = 0.011; 61.4% versus 82.2% for FIS1, P = 0.029). In CN-AML, patients with high FIS1 expression were more likely to be resistant to two courses of induction (P = 0.035). Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were shorter in CN-AML patients with high PDCD7 expression (P<0.001; P = 0.006), and PDCD7 was revealed to be an independent risk factor for OS in CN-AML (P = 0.004). In the analysis of published data from 225 CN-AML patients, PDCD7 remained independently predicting OS in CN-AML (P = 0.039). As a conclusion, Ang2 and FIS1 seem related to decreased CR rate of AML patients, and PDCD7 is associated with shorter OS and RFS in CN-AML. Hence, PDCD7, Ang2 and FIS1 may indicate a more aggressive form and poor prognosis of AML.","['Tian, Yiming', 'Huang, Zoufang', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Yin, Changxin', 'Zhou, Lanlan', 'Zhang, Lingxiu', 'Huang, Kaikai', 'Zhou, Hongsheng', 'Jiang, Xuejie', 'Li, Jinming', 'Liao, Libin', 'Yang, Mo', 'Meng, Fanyi']","['Tian Y', 'Huang Z', 'Wang Z', 'Yin C', 'Zhou L', 'Zhang L', 'Huang K', 'Zhou H', 'Jiang X', 'Li J', 'Liao L', 'Yang M', 'Meng F']","['Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Bioinformatics Department, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China ; LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Hematology Department of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140108,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FIS1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (PDCD7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (VPS51 protein, human)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3885535,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084150 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-39265 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 8;9(1):e84150. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084150. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPR1J-340 inhibited the phosphorylation of FLT3 and STAT5 and triggered apoptosis in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells. The pharmacokinetic parameters of BPR1J-340 in rats were determined.

We evaluated the relation of the red cell 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) metabolite 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6MMP) with hypoglycemia. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed charts of three patients with ALL and symptomatic hypoglycemia while fasting who were noted to have high levels of 6MMP. All patients had an empiric trial of switching from evening to morning 6-MP administration, and two patients were subsequently switched to twice daily dosing. Patients also received complex carbohydrates at bedtime. RESULTS: Switching 6-MP from evening to morning administration reduced 6MMP levels yet preserved adequate levels of the active metabolite red cell 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6TGN). All patients had decreased hypoglycemic events when changed from evening to morning dosing. Two patients showed a rebound in 6MMP levels with return of hypoglycemic symptoms. Both were then switched to twice daily 6-MP dosing with one having a decrease in 6MMP and hypoglycemic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of 6MMP are associated with symptomatic hypoglycemia which may be mitigated by switching to morning or twice daily 6-MP dose administration.","['Melachuri, Samyuktha', 'Gandrud, Laura', 'Bostrom, Bruce']","['Melachuri S', 'Gandrud L', 'Bostrom B']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140110,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Dietary Carbohydrates)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Liver Glycogen)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', '6V404DV25O (6-methylthiopurine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fasting/*blood', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/chemically induced', 'Hypoglycemia/*chemically induced', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Liver Glycogen/metabolism', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thionucleotides/*blood']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24928 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jun;61(6):1003-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24928.

Since monoallelic mutations have also been shown to have negative prognostic impact, it is recommended to examine both TP53 mutations and deletions. Several methods are used to detect TP53 mutations, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming a convenient option for routine analysis. Besides this, ultradeep NGS permits the detection of minor clones carrying TP53 mutations, even below 1%.

Treatment consisted of eight 28-day cycles of CLB (8 mg/m(2) /day, days 1-7) and R (day 1 of cycle 3, 375 mg/m(2) ; cycles 4-8, 500 mg/m(2) ). Responders were randomized to 12 8-week doses of R (375 mg/m(2) ) or observation. As per intention-to-treat analysis, 82.4% (95% CI, 74.25-90.46%) of 85 patients achieved an overall response (OR), 16.5% a complete response (CR), 2.4% a CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery. The OR was similar across Binet stages (A 86.4%, B 81.6%, and C 78.6%) and age categories (60-64 years, 92.3%; 65-69, 85.2%; 70-74, 75.0%; >/=75, 81.0%). CLB-R was well tolerated. After a median follow-up of 34.2 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 34.7 months (95% CI, 33.1-39.5). TP53 abnormalities, complex karyotype, and low CD20 gene expression predicted lack of response; SF3B1 mutation and BIRC3 disruption low CR rates. IGHV mutations significantly predicted PFS. R maintenance tended towards a better PFS than observation and was safe and most beneficial for patients in partial response and for unmutated IGHV cases. CLB-R represents a promising option for elderly CLL patients.","['Foa, Robin', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Cencini, Emanuele', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Nobile, Francesco', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Brugiatelli, Maura', 'Massaia, Massimo', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Rizzi, Rita', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Di Serio, Francesca', 'Orsucci, Lorella', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Mura, Maria Angela', 'Soriani, Silvia', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Bonina, Silvia', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Starza, Irene Della', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Alietti, Alessandra', 'Runggaldier, Eva Josephine', 'Gamba, Enrica', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Guarini, Anna']","['Foa R', 'Del Giudice I', 'Cuneo A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Ciolli S', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Lauria F', 'Cencini E', 'Rigolin GM', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Nobile F', 'Callea V', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Massaia M', 'Molica S', 'Trentin L', 'Rizzi R', 'Specchia G', 'Di Serio F', 'Orsucci L', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Montillo M', 'Zinzani PL', 'Ferrara F', 'Morabito F', 'Mura MA', 'Soriani S', 'Peragine N', 'Tavolaro S', 'Bonina S', 'Marinelli M', 'De Propris MS', 'Starza ID', 'Piciocchi A', 'Alietti A', 'Runggaldier EJ', 'Gamba E', 'Mauro FR', 'Chiaretti S', 'Guarini A']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140218,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23668 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 May;89(5):480-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23668.

However, its operative relevance in these cells remains elusive. We have over-expressed SKI to define its intrinsic role in hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms, which resulted in a robust competitive advantage upon transplantation, a complete dominance of the stem and progenitor compartments, and a marked enhancement of myeloid differentiation at the expense of other lineages. Accordingly, enforced expression of SKI induced a gene signature associated with hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid differentiation, as well as hepatocyte growth factor signaling. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to what has generally been assumed, the significant impact of SKI on hematopoiesis is independent of its ability to inhibit TGF-beta signaling. Instead, myeloid progenitors expressing SKI are partially dependent on functional hepatocyte growth factor signaling. Collectively our results demonstrate that SKI is an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell activity and its overexpression leads to myeloproliferative disease.","['Singbrant, Sofie', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Moody, Jennifer', 'Karlsson, Goran', 'Chalk, Alistair M', 'Liddicoat, Brian', 'Russell, Megan R', 'Walkley, Carl R', 'Karlsson, Stefan']","['Singbrant S', 'Wall M', 'Moody J', 'Karlsson G', 'Chalk AM', 'Liddicoat B', 'Russell MR', 'Walkley CR', 'Karlsson S']",['sofie.singbrant@med.lu.se.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140110,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '126648-96-2 (SKI protein, human)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",PMC3971074,2014/01/15 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.093971 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.093971 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Apr;99(4):647-55. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.093971.

Several immunophenotypic markers have been identified as significant and independent prognostic variables, especially from retrospective cohorts. However, while attractive because their detection is inexpensive and feasible in most laboratories, only few have been validated by independent series. The expression of leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (also known as LAIR1, LAIR-1 or CD305), an inhibitor of B-cell receptor-mediated signaling, has been reported to be lacking in high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, its correlation with biological variables and its prognostic significance remain unknown. We investigated 311 consecutive patients, prospectively enrolled since 2007. Methods for studying patients were standardized and included clinical assessment, immunophenotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and status of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes. Overall, 22.1% of patients had Binet stage B or C disease, 38.5% had unmutated immunoglobulin genes, 15.1% had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, 23.4% were CD38(+), 37.8% CD49d(+), and 59.8% LAIR1(+). Expression of LAIR1 was inversely related to that of CD38 (P=0.0005), but was not associated with CD49d expression (P=0.96). A significantly lower expression of LAIR1 was observed in patients with Binet stage B or C disease (P=0.023), and in the presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (P=0.048) or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (P<0.0001). At univariate analysis LAIR1(+) was significantly associated with longer time to first treatment (P=0.0002). This favorable effect of LAIR1(+) was confirmed by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio=2.1, P=0.03 for LAIR1). Our results indicate that LAIR1 expression is a reliable and inexpensive marker capable of independently predicting time to first treatment in newly diagnosed unselected patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Perbellini, Omar', 'Falisi, Erika', 'Giaretta, Ilaria', 'Boscaro, Elisa', 'Novella, Elisabetta', 'Facco, Monica', 'Fortuna, Stefania', 'Finotto, Silvia', 'Amati, Eliana', 'Maniscalco, Francesco', 'Montaldi, Anna', 'Alghisi, Alberta', 'Aprili, Fiorenza', 'Bonaldi, Laura', 'Paolini, Rossella', 'Scupoli, Maria Teresa', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Visco, Carlo']","['Perbellini O', 'Falisi E', 'Giaretta I', 'Boscaro E', 'Novella E', 'Facco M', 'Fortuna S', 'Finotto S', 'Amati E', 'Maniscalco F', 'Montaldi A', 'Alghisi A', 'Aprili F', 'Bonaldi L', 'Paolini R', 'Scupoli MT', 'Trentin L', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Semenzato G', 'Pizzolo G', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Visco C']",['carlovisco@hotmail.com.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4008102,2014/01/15 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.096362 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.096362 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 May;99(5):881-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.096362.

We investigated the safety and tolerability of an oral formulation of clofarabine for consolidation therapy of patients aged 60 and older with AML. In this phase I study, twenty-two patients older than 60 years with AML in first complete remission were treated once daily with oral clofarabine for 14 or 21 days of a 28-day cycle, for up to five cycles. Dose escalation from 1 mg to 6 mg daily using a 3 + 3 design was used to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and tolerability of oral clofarabine. No DLTs or Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities were observed. The primary toxicities were hematologic, including uncomplicated grade 3-4 neutropenia (50%) and thrombocytopenia (50%). Given that myelosuppression necessitating dose delays/reductions was observed more commonly at higher doses, the recommended phase II dose is 2 mg daily for 21 of 28 days. At doses equal to or greater than 2 mg, the median relapse-free survival was 28.35 months. Oral clofarabine was well-tolerated with encouraging activity in patients older than 60 years.

Most patients experience lymphocytosis, representing lymphocyte egress from nodal compartments. This resolves within 8 months in the majority of patients, but a subgroup has lymphocytosis lasting >12 months. Here we report a detailed characterization of patients with persistent lymphocytosis during ibrutinib therapy. Signaling evaluation showed that while BTK is inhibited, downstream mediators of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling are activated in persistent lymphocytes. These cells cannot be stimulated through the BCR and do not show evidence of target gene activation. Flow cytometry for kappa and lambda expression, IGHV sequencing, Zap-70 methylation, and targeted gene sequencing in these patients are identical at baseline and later time points, suggesting that persistent lymphocytes do not represent clonal evolution. In vitro treatment with targeted kinase inhibitors shows that they are not addicted to a single survival pathway. Finally, progression-free survival is not inferior for patients with prolonged lymphocytosis vs those with traditional responses. Thus, prolonged lymphocytosis is common following ibrutinib treatment, likely represents the persistence of a quiescent clone, and does not predict a subgroup of patients likely to relapse early.","['Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Smucker, Kelly', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Lozanski, Arletta', 'Zhong, Yiming', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Lucas, David', 'Williams, Katie', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Ghia, Emanuela', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Mantel, Rose', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Flynn, Joseph', 'Maddocks, Kami', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Furman, Richard R', 'James, Danelle F', 'Clow, Fong', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C']","['Woyach JA', 'Smucker K', 'Smith LL', 'Lozanski A', 'Zhong Y', 'Ruppert AS', 'Lucas D', 'Williams K', 'Zhao W', 'Rassenti L', 'Ghia E', 'Kipps TJ', 'Mantel R', 'Jones J', 'Flynn J', 'Maddocks K', ""O'Brien S"", 'Furman RR', 'James DF', 'Clow F', 'Lozanski G', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipase C gamma/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",PMC3962160,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35847-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-09-527853 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 20;123(12):1810-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-09-527853.

Although early phase clinical assessment indicated that treatment with HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) may be effective in t(8;21) AML patients, rigorous preclinical studies to identify the molecular and biological events that may determine therapeutic responses have not been performed. Using an AML mouse model driven by expression of AML1/ETO9a (A/E9a), we demonstrated that treatment of mice bearing t(8;21) AML with the HDACi panobinostat caused a robust antileukemic response that did not require functional p53 nor activation of conventional apoptotic pathways. Panobinostat triggered terminal myeloid differentiation via proteasomal degradation of A/E9a. Importantly, conditional A/E9a deletion phenocopied the effects of panobinostat and other HDACis, indicating that destabilization of A/E9a is critical for the antileukemic activity of these agents.","['Bots, Michael', 'Verbrugge, Inge', 'Martin, Benjamin P', 'Salmon, Jessica M', 'Ghisi, Margherita', 'Baker, Adele', 'Stanley, Kym', 'Shortt, Jake', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Rappaport, Amy R', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Johnstone, Ricky W']","['Bots M', 'Verbrugge I', 'Martin BP', 'Salmon JM', 'Ghisi M', 'Baker A', 'Stanley K', 'Shortt J', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Zuber J', 'Rappaport AR', 'Atadja P', 'Lowe SW', 'Johnstone RW']","['Cancer Therapeutics Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, VIC, Australia;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Panobinostat', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3938147,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35958-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-488114 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 27;123(9):1341-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-488114.

HR criteria were minimal residual disease (MRD) levels >/=10(-3) at day 78 (MRD-HR), no complete remission (CR) at day 33, t(4;11) translocation, and prednisone poor response (PPR). Treatment (2 years) included protocol I, 3 polychemotherapy blocks, delayed intensification (protocol IIx2 or IIIx3), cranial radiotherapy, and maintenance. A total of 312 HR patients had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 58.9% (standard error [SE] = 2.8) and an overall survival of 68.9% (SE = 2.6). In hierarchical order, EFS was 45.9% (4.4) in 132 MRD-HR patients, 41.2% (11.9) in 17 patients with no CR at day 33, 36.4% (14.5) in 11 patients with t(4;11), and 74.0% (3.6) in 152 HR patients only for PPR. No statistically significant difference was found for disease-free survival in patients with very HR features [MRD-HR, no CR at day 33, t(4;11) translocation], given hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (n = 66) or chemotherapy only (n = 88), after adjusting for waiting time to HSCT (5.7 months). Patients at HR only for PPR have a favorable outcome. MRD-HR is associated with poor outcome despite intensive treatment and/or HSCT and may qualify for innovative therapies.

METHODS: Prophylaxis treatment was administered during intensive chemotherapy in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012. Oral ciprofloxacin (at a dose of 300 mg/m(2) /12 hours) was administered after chemotherapy when a patient with AML or ALL became neutropenic and > 7 days of neutropenia was expected. Voriconazole (at a dose of 4 mg/kg/12 hours) was initiated at the onset of neutropenia in patients with AML and after 7 days of neutropenia in patients with ALL. Micafungin (at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day) was substituted for voriconazole when patients with ALL received vincristine. Prophylaxis treatment was discontinued when the absolute neutrophil count recovered to > 100/muL. All episodes of bloodstream infection, IFI, febrile neutropenia, and intensive care unit stays related to severe infection occurring between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012 were recorded. RESULTS: During the preprophylaxis period, 62 children with ALL and 24 children with AML experienced a total of 44 episodes of bloodstream infection and 22 episodes of IFI. Seven patients died of severe infection. In contrast, in the prophylaxis period, 10 episodes of bloodstream infection occurred and no IFIs were reported to occur in 51 patients with ALL and 14 patients with AML. Moreover, no patient died of severe infection. Episodes of febrile neutropenia and intensive care unit stay were significantly reduced during the prophylaxis period. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin and voriconazole or micafungin was found to reduce the rates of bloodstream infection and IFI in children with acute leukemia undergoing intensive chemotherapy.","['Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Hou, Jen-Yin', 'Chen, Kuan-Hao', 'Huang, Ting-Huan', 'Chang, Ching-Yi', 'Liang, Der-Cherng']","['Yeh TC', 'Liu HC', 'Hou JY', 'Chen KH', 'Huang TH', 'Chang CY', 'Liang DC']","['Department of Medicine, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140110,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Costs', 'Echinocandins/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lipopeptides/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sepsis/*prevention & control', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/05/31 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28524 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Apr 15;120(8):1255-62. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28524.

To explore the role of the fetal hematopoietic microenvironment in the pathogenesis of TAM, we examined the in vitro influences of stromal cells of human FL and fetal bone marrow (FBM) on the growth of TAM blasts. Both FL and FBM stromal cells expressed mesenchymal cell antigens (vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, CD146, and nestin), being consistent with perivascular cells/mesenchymal stem cells that support hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, a small fraction of the FL stromal cells expressed an epithelial marker, cytokeratin 8, indicating that they could be cells in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the coculture system, stromal cells of the FL, but not FBM, potently supported the growth of TAM blast progenitors, mainly through humoral factors. High concentrations of hematopoietic growth factors were detected in culture supernatants of the FL stromal cells and a neutralizing antibody against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) almost completely inhibited the growth-supportive activity of the culture supernatants. These results indicate that FL stromal cells with unique characteristics of EMT cells provide a pivotal hematopoietic microenvironment for TAM blasts and that GM-CSF produced by FL stromal cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of TAM.","['Miyauchi, Jun', 'Kawaguchi, Hiroyuki']","['Miyauchi J', 'Kawaguchi H']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital, Ichikawa, Chiba-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (CD146 Antigen)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Vimentin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Myeloproliferative Syndrome, Transient']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'CD146 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down Syndrome/metabolism/*pathology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemoid Reaction/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver/*cytology/embryology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth/chemistry', 'Nestin/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24764 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2014 Jun;115(6):1176-86. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24764.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DOWN SYNDROME', 'EMT', 'FETAL LIVER', 'GM-CSF', 'HEMATOPOIETIC MICROENVIRONMENT', 'MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL', 'TAM', 'TMD', 'TRANSIENT LEUKEMIA']",,,,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

This report describes the preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of EPZ-5676, an aminonucleoside analog with exquisite target potency and selectivity that has shown robust and durable tumor growth inhibition in preclinical models. The in vivo pharmacokinetics in mouse, rat and dog were characterized following i.v. and p.o. administration; EPZ-5676 had moderate to high clearance, low oral bioavailability with a steady-state volume of distribution 2-3 fold higher than total body water. EPZ-5676 showed biexponential kinetics following i.v. administration, giving rise to a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2 ) of 1.1, 3.7 and 13.6 h in mouse, rat and dog, respectively. The corresponding in vitro ADME parameters were also studied and utilized for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation purposes. There was good agreement between the microsomal clearance and the in vivo clearance implicating hepatic oxidative metabolism as the predominant elimination route in preclinical species. Furthermore, low renal clearance was observed in mouse, approximating to fu -corrected glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and thus passive glomerular filtration. The metabolic pathways across species were studied in liver microsomes in which EPZ-5676 was metabolized to three monohydroxylated metabolites (M1, M3 and M5), one N-dealkylated product (M4) as well as an N-oxide (M6).","['Basavapathruni, Aravind', 'Olhava, Edward J', 'Daigle, Scott R', 'Therkelsen, Carly A', 'Jin, Lei', 'Boriack-Sjodin, P Ann', 'Allain, Christina J', 'Klaus, Christine R', 'Raimondi, Alejandra', 'Scott, Margaret Porter', 'Dovletoglou, Angelos', 'Richon, Victoria M', 'Pollock, Roy M', 'Copeland, Robert A', 'Moyer, Mikel P', 'Chesworth, Richard', 'Pearson, Paul G', 'Waters, Nigel J']","['Basavapathruni A', 'Olhava EJ', 'Daigle SR', 'Therkelsen CA', 'Jin L', 'Boriack-Sjodin PA', 'Allain CJ', 'Klaus CR', 'Raimondi A', 'Scott MP', 'Dovletoglou A', 'Richon VM', 'Pollock RM', 'Copeland RA', 'Moyer MP', 'Chesworth R', 'Pearson PG', 'Waters NJ']","['Epizyme Inc., 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140214,England,Biopharm Drug Dispos,Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,7911226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (EPZ-5676)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Dot1l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (DOT1L protein, rat)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Benzimidazoles/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bdd.1889 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopharm Drug Dispos. 2014 May;35(4):237-52. doi: 10.1002/bdd.1889.

This, and the need for frequent re-compensation due to the possible spectral spillover variation between tandem lots, reduces the robustness of clinical flow cytometry panels that include tandems. Since tandems are required for standard 8-10 color screens, further studies of the stability of tandems in cocktails and their spillover variability are warranted. METHODS: The performance of PE- and APC-tandems stored in cocktails was tested on fresh bone marrow, preserved blood and lyophilized cell samples over 1-, 6-, or 8-week periods, respectively, and their spillover matrices were compared. The observed correction factor differences were used as the basis for analyzing how the application of an incorrect compensation matrix could influence data interpretation. RESULTS: Signal intensities and background fluorescence remained constant for all fluorochromes in the cocktails tested. Spillover correction factors for different PE-Cy7 mAbs did not exceed or were only marginally higher than those for non-tandem organic dye-conjugated mAb. By applying the correction factor differences observed between tandem mAb lots to clinical data, it was found that the over and under compensation would not alter the clinical interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Tandems can be safely stored and used in cocktails. However, each cocktail should be tested on relevant material prior to use. Exact compensation settings are a requirement for accurate data. Provided that careful evaluation of tandem compensation requirements is carried out, certain tandems may use a generic compensation matrix.","['Johansson, Ulrika', 'Macey, Marion']","['Johansson U', 'Macey M']","['Haematology Oncology Diagnostics, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, BS2 8HW, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140110,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We established cell lines from a patient with CML at the time of first diagnosis and relapsed phase and designated them as NPhA1 and NPhA2, respectively. Stable underexpressing EphB4 cells (NPhA2-sh) were obtained. The activated signal proteins in cells were tested by Western blot. The EphB4 was overexpressed in IM-resistant NPhA2 in comparison with the NPhA1 cell line, but the expression of EphB4 mRNA and protein significantly decreased in knockdown NPhA2-EphB4-sh cells compared with NPhA2 and NPhA1 (P < 0.001) cell lines. NPhA2-EphB4-sh cells were sensitive to IM (IC50 0.93 mg/L), and NPhA2 showed IM resistance (IC50 5.45 mg/L) (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, phospho-Rac1/cdc42 was significantly increased in NPhA2 cells compared to NPhA2-EphB4-sh (P < 0.001). The apoptosis rate reached 58.71 +/- 2.39 % with NPhA2 cells incubated with HHT + IM, which was higher than NPhA2 cells incubated with IM alone (P = 0.002). IC50 of NPhA2 cells incubated with IM was 5.45 mg/L. However, co-stimulation with HHT + IM decreased the IC50 of NPhA2 cells from 5.45 to 1.17 mg/L (P < 0.001). Furthermore, HHT blocked the expressions of EphB4/RhoA, but did not down-regulate the phospho-MEK/ERK in NPhA2 cells. The overexpression of EphB4 contributed to IM resistance in CML line cells. EphB4/RhoA may be a new marker of IM resistance. HHT + IM gained more treatment advantages than IM alone by blocking EphB4/RhoA pathways in CML cell lines.","['Huang, Bin-Tao', 'Zeng, Qing-Chun', 'Zhao, Wei-Hong', 'Tan, Yan']","['Huang BT', 'Zeng QC', 'Zhao WH', 'Tan Y']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 TongDao Avenue North, Hohhot, 010059, People's Republic of China, huangbintao1979@sina.com.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140111,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphB4)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', '*Drug Synergism', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, EphB4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0836-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Feb;31(2):836. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0836-9.

Its pathogenesis remains unclear, but mutations in epigenetic modifiers are common and the disease often responds to DNA methylation inhibitors. We analyzed DNA methylation in the bone marrow and spleen in two mouse models of MDS/AML, the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) mouse and the RUNX1 mutant mouse model. Methylation array analysis showed an average of 512/3445 (14.9%) genes hypermethylated in NHD13 MDS, and 331 (9.6%) genes hypermethylated in RUNX1 MDS. Thirty-two percent of genes in common between the two models (2/3 NHD13 mice and 2/3 RUNX1 mice) were also hypermethylated in at least two of 19 human MDS samples. Detailed analysis of 41 genes in mice showed progressive drift in DNA methylation from young to old normal bone marrow and spleen; to MDS, where we detected accelerated age-related methylation; and finally to AML, which markedly extends DNA methylation abnormalities. Most of these genes showed similar patterns in human MDS and AML. Repeat element hypomethylation was rare in MDS but marked the transition to AML in some cases. Our data show consistency in patterns of aberrant DNA methylation in human and mouse MDS and suggest that epigenetically, MDS displays an accelerated aging phenotype.","['Maegawa, Shinji', 'Gough, Sheryl M', 'Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Lu, Yue', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Castoro, Ryan J', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Maegawa S', 'Gough SM', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang N', 'Castoro RJ', 'Estecio MR', 'Jelinek J', 'Liang S', 'Kitamura T', 'Aplan PD', 'Issa JP']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics']",PMC3975058,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.157529.113 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.157529.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2014 Apr;24(4):580-91. doi: 10.1101/gr.157529.113.

Eighty-four CML patient samples (42 at diagnosis and 42 at 3-month intervals from the same patients) were analyzed for Bcr-Abl transcript levels. Quantification results revealed that the patients with <10% Bcr-Abl levels at 3 months had higher rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and optimal responses compared to patients with >10% Bcr-Abl levels (P < 0.0001). Patients with >10% Bcr-Abl levels were found to have 25.0% of suboptimal response and 3.57% of failure to imatinib at standard dose. Hence, the present study confirms that early molecular monitoring at 3 months after imatinib initiation helps in predicting the concurrent cytogenetic response and treatment optimization in CML patients.","['Kagita, Sailaja', 'Jiwtani, Sangeeta', 'Uppalapati, Srihari', 'Linga, Vijay Gandhi', 'Gundeti, Sadasivudu', 'Digumarti, Raghunadharao']","['Kagita S', 'Jiwtani S', 'Uppalapati S', 'Linga VG', 'Gundeti S', 'Digumarti R']","['Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences, Punjagutta, Hyderabad, 500082, Andhra Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140112,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1585-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 May;35(5):4443-6. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1585-2.

However, the results were inconsistent. The objective of the current study is to investigate the association by meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and Weipu databases, covering all studies until Aug. 7, 2013. Statistical analysis was performed by using the RevMan4.2 software and the Stata10.0 software. A total of 20 case-control studies concerning the Arg194Trp polymorphism were indentified from 19 articles. In total analysis, our results suggested that the Arg194Trp polymorphism was not associated with an increased/decreased risk of hematological malignancies (odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.85-1.22, P = 0.87 for Arg/Trp+Trp/Trp vs. Arg/Arg). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association was found either among Asians (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.84-1.29, P = 0.72) or among Europeans (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.72-1.49, P = 0.83); in the subgroup analyses by cancer types, no significant association was found either among leukemia (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.89-1.35, P = 0.39) or in lymphoma (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.57-1.22, P = 0.35). The current meta-analysis indicated that the Arg194Trp polymorphism in the XRCC1 gene might be not a risk factor for hematological malignancies.

This prospective study was designed to detect the mutant NPM protein using immunohistochemical staining in AML patients and to evaluate its application as a surrogate marker for NPM1 gene mutation analysis. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This is a prospective study at a general community hospital in Baghdad (Baghdad Teaching Hospital) during the period from March 2011 to July 2011. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the mutant NPM protein in bone marrow biopsies fixed in Bouin solution from 30 adult AML patients using anti-NPM polyclonal antibody. Molecular analysis was done on bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 16/30 (53%) patients using single strand confirmatory polymorphism-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (SSCP-RT-PCR). RESULTS: Using Immunohistochemical staining, 17/30 (56.7%) of AML patients were positive for the mutant NPM protein. The percentage of positive blast cells ranged from 30% to 100%. A significant relation was found between RT-PCR analysis and immunohistochemical staining (P=.009). The sensitivity of Immunohistochemical staining in detection of mutated NPM1 cases was 90%, whereas the specificity of this technique was 87.5%. CONCLUSION: The findings of immunohistochemical staining of NPM protein were significantly related with the molecular findings of NPM1 gene analysis, and the immunohistochemical staining technique was both sensitive and specific. These findings might be a prime step for the future utilization of this technique as a surrogate marker for the detection of NPM1 gene mutations in under-resourced countries as Iraq. Still, a larger study recruiting a larger number of patients will be useful for the assessment of the significance of immunohistochemical staining in the detection of minimal residual disease in NPM cytoplasmic positive AML, which is a good prognostic entity.","['Al-Husseinawi, Ethar Kadhim']",['Al-Husseinawi EK'],"['Dr. Ethar Kadhim Al-Husseinawi, Hematology Specialist Main Laboratories,, Al Karama Teaching Hospital,, Al Kut Iraq, T: +4795955516, etharhusseinawi@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Iraq', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC6074910,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5144/0256-4947.2013.539 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2013 Nov-Dec;33(6):539-46. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2013.539.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, cancer cells are characterized by substantial heterogeneity in basal signaling and in response to perturbations, such as drug treatment. In this work, we examined the response of 678 individual U937 (human acute myeloid leukemia) cells to an aminopeptidase-inhibiting chemotherapeutic drug (Tosedostat) over the course of 95 days. Using a fluorescent reporter peptide and a microfluidic device, we quantified the rate of reporter degradation as a function of dose. While the single-cell measurements reflected ensemble results, they added a layer of detail by revealing unique degradation patterns and outliers within the larger population. Regression modeling of the data allowed us to quantitatively explore the relationships between reporter loading, incubation time, and drug dose on peptidase activity in individual cells. Incubation time was negatively correlated with the number of peptide fragment peaks observed, while peak area (which was proportional to reporter loading) was positively correlated with both the number of fragment peaks observed and the degradation rate. Notably, a statistically significant change in the number of peaks observed was identified as dose increased from 2 to 4 muM. Similarly, a significant difference in degradation rate as a function of reporter loading was observed for doses >/=2 muM compared to the 1 muM dose. These results suggest that additional enzymes may become inhibited at doses >1 muM and >2 muM, demonstrating the utility of single-cell data to yield novel biological hypotheses.","['Kovarik, Michelle L', 'Dickinson, Alexandra J', 'Roy, Pourab', 'Poonnen, Ranjit A', 'Fine, Jason P', 'Allbritton, Nancy L']","['Kovarik ML', 'Dickinson AJ', 'Roy P', 'Poonnen RA', 'Fine JP', 'Allbritton NL']","['Department of Chemistry, CB 3290, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'KZK563J2UW (tosedostat)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glycine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Regression Analysis', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3940261,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c3ib40249e [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2014 Feb;6(2):164-74. doi: 10.1039/c3ib40249e.,,,,"['UL1 TR001111/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB011763/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA171631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1UL1TR001111/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 GM000678/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA171631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EB11763/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS557501'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to characterize secondary events associated with leukemic transformation. RAG-mediated deletions emerge as the dominant mutational process, characterized by recombination signal sequence motifs near breakpoints, incorporation of non-templated sequence at junctions, approximately 30-fold enrichment at promoters and enhancers of genes actively transcribed in B cell development and an unexpectedly high ratio of recurrent to non-recurrent structural variants. Single-cell tracking shows that this mechanism is active throughout leukemic evolution, with evidence of localized clustering and reiterated deletions. Integration of data on point mutations and rearrangements identifies ATF7IP and MGA as two new tumor-suppressor genes in ALL. Thus, a remarkably parsimonious mutational process transforms ETV6-RUNX1-positive lymphoblasts, targeting the promoters, enhancers and first exons of genes that normally regulate B cell differentiation.","['Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Li, Yilong', 'Potter, Nicola E', 'Wedge, David C', 'Tubio, Jose', 'Alexandrov, Ludmil B', 'Van Loo, Peter', 'Cooke, Susanna L', 'Marshall, John', 'Martincorena, Inigo', 'Hinton, Jonathan', 'Gundem, Gunes', 'van Delft, Frederik W', 'Nik-Zainal, Serena', 'Jones, David R', 'Ramakrishna, Manasa', 'Titley, Ian', 'Stebbings, Lucy', 'Leroy, Catherine', 'Menzies, Andrew', 'Gamble, John', 'Robinson, Ben', 'Mudie, Laura', 'Raine, Keiran', ""O'Meara, Sarah"", 'Teague, Jon W', 'Butler, Adam P', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Ford, Anthony M', 'Stratton, Michael R', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Campbell, Peter J']","['Papaemmanuil E', 'Rapado I', 'Li Y', 'Potter NE', 'Wedge DC', 'Tubio J', 'Alexandrov LB', 'Van Loo P', 'Cooke SL', 'Marshall J', 'Martincorena I', 'Hinton J', 'Gundem G', 'van Delft FW', 'Nik-Zainal S', 'Jones DR', 'Ramakrishna M', 'Titley I', 'Stebbings L', 'Leroy C', 'Menzies A', 'Gamble J', 'Robinson B', 'Mudie L', 'Raine K', ""O'Meara S"", 'Teague JW', 'Butler AP', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Zuna J', 'Kempski H', 'Muschen M', 'Ford AM', 'Stratton MR', 'Greaves M', 'Campbell PJ']","['Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, Sutton, London, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', '1] Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.

We found that the apoptotic rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtype M2 (AML-M2) cell line Kasumi-1 treated by UA was higher than those of other leukemia cell lines, but was not as high as that treated by arabinofuranosyl cytidine (Ara-C), suggesting that UA is an important chemotherapeutic agent to treat AML-M2. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a key enzyme exerting potent cytoprotection, cell proliferation, and drug resistance. HO-1 in Kasumi-1 cells was upregulated by being treated with low-dose rather than high-dose UA. Inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) IX sensitized Kasumi-1 cells to UA, and the apoptotic rate was close to that induced by Ara-C (P<0.01). The sensitizing effect of ZnPP was associated with caspase activation, bcl-2 downregulation, and PARP activation. After silencing HO-1 by siRNA transfection with lentivirus, the cells' proliferation induced by UA was increased as it was by Ara-C. Furthermore, combining ZnPP with UA prolonged the survival of mice bearing the AML subtype M2 tumor with smaller volume of tumor and size of spleen. The results showed that the Kasumi-1 cell line was the most sensitive to UA, but the apoptotic effect was inferior to that treated by Ara-C because of HO-1 upregulation. AML-M2 can feasibly be treated by target-inhibiting HO-1 that enhances the antileukemia effects of UA in vitro and in vivo.","['Ma, Dan', 'Fang, Qin', 'Li, Yan', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Sun, Jia', 'Zhang, Yaming', 'Hu, Xiuying', 'Wang, Ping', 'Zhou, Shengshu']","['Ma D', 'Fang Q', 'Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Sun J', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu X', 'Wang P', 'Zhou S']","['aDepartment of Pharmacy, Affiliated BaiYun Hospital of Guiyang Medical College Departments of bPharmacy cHematology dGuiZhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College eKey Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of GuiZhou Province, Guiyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '15442-64-5 (zinc protoporphyrin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protoporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000068 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2014 Apr;25(4):406-14. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000068.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has not previously been shown to have a role in cancer. However, a mass spectrometry-based lipidomics platform revealed the presence of high amounts of OEA in the plasma of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients compared with normal donors. CLL cells produced OEA and the magnitude of plasma OEA levels was related directly to the circulating leukemic cell number. OEA from CLL cells was increased by URB-597, an inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and decreased by inflammatory mediators that downregulate expression of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). These enzymes degrade and synthesize OEA, respectively. Nonphysiologic doses of OEA prevented spontaneous apoptosis of CLL cells in a receptor-independent manner that was mimicked by its free fatty acid (FFA) derivative oleate. However, OEA-containing supernatants from CLL cells induced lipolysis in adipocytes, lipid products from adipocytes protected CLL cells from cytotoxic chemotherapy, and increased levels of FFAs were found in CLL plasma that correlated with OEA. We suggest OEA is a lipolytic factor produced by CLL cells to fuel their growth with a potential role in drug resistance and cancer cachexia.","['Masoodi, M', 'Lee, E', 'Eiden, M', 'Bahlo, A', 'Shi, Y', 'Ceddia, R B', 'Baccei, C', 'Prasit, P', 'Spaner, D E']","['Masoodi M', 'Lee E', 'Eiden M', 'Bahlo A', 'Shi Y', 'Ceddia RB', 'Baccei C', 'Prasit P', 'Spaner DE']","['1] Nestle Institute of Health Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland [2] Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK [3] Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK [2] Metabolomx, Mountain View, CA, USA.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Kinesiology and Health Science, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Inception Sciences, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Inception Sciences, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', '1] Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [3] Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [4] Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [5] Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '1HI5J9N8E6 (oleoylethanolamide)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oleic Acid/metabolism', 'Oleic Acids/blood/*metabolism']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201410 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.10 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1381-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.10.

However, pharmacologically activated p53 can induce diverse responses ranging from cell death to growth arrest and DNA repair, which limits the efficient application of p53-reactivating drugs in clinic. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms defining the biological outcome upon p53 activation remains a grand challenge in the p53 field. Here, we report that concurrent pharmacological activation of p53 and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), result in the synthetic lethality in cancer cells. ROS promote the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and DNA damage response, which establishes a positive feedback loop with p53. This converts the p53-induced growth arrest/senescence to apoptosis. We identified several survival oncogenes inhibited by p53 in JNK-dependent manner, including Mcl1, PI3K, eIF4E, as well as p53 inhibitors Wip1 and MdmX. Further, we show that Wip1 is one of the crucial executors downstream of JNK whose ablation confers the enhanced and sustained p53 transcriptional response contributing to cell death. Our study provides novel insights for manipulating p53 response in a controlled way. Further, our results may enable new pharmacological strategy to exploit abnormally high ROS level, often linked with higher aggressiveness in cancer, to selectively kill cancer cells upon pharmacological reactivation of p53.","['Shi, Y', 'Nikulenkov, F', 'Zawacka-Pankau, J', 'Li, H', 'Gabdoulline, R', 'Xu, J', 'Eriksson, S', 'Hedstrom, E', 'Issaeva, N', 'Kel, A', 'Arner, E S J', 'Selivanova, G']","['Shi Y', 'Nikulenkov F', 'Zawacka-Pankau J', 'Li H', 'Gabdoulline R', 'Xu J', 'Eriksson S', 'Hedstrom E', 'Issaeva N', 'Kel A', 'Arner ES', 'Selivanova G']","['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', '1] Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden [2] Department of Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, UG-MUG 80-822, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'geneXplain GmbH D-38302, Wolfenbuttel, Germany.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'geneXplain GmbH D-38302, Wolfenbuttel, Germany.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institutet 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (TXNRD1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin Reductase 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/metabolism', 'Thioredoxin Reductase 1/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3950324,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2013186 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.186 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2014 Apr;21(4):612-23. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.186.

The prognostic value of BAALC expression in relation to other molecular prognosticators was analyzed in 326 CN-AML patients (<65 years). At diagnosis, high BAALC expression was associated with prognostically adverse mutations: FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) with an FLT3-ITD/FLT3 wild-type (wt) ratio of >/=0.5 (P=0.001), partial tandem duplications within the MLL gene (MLL-PTD) (P=0.002), RUNX1 mutations (mut) (P<0.001) and WT1mut (P=0.001), while it was negatively associated with NPM1mut (P<0.001). However, high BAALC expression was also associated with prognostically favorable biallelic CEBPA (P=0.001). Survival analysis revealed an independent adverse prognostic impact of high BAALC expression on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), and also on OS when eliminating the effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) (OS(TXcens)). Furthermore, we analyzed BAALC expression in 416 diagnostic and follow-up samples of 66 patients. During follow-up, BAALC expression correlated with mutational load or expression levels, respectively, of other minimal residual disease markers: FLT3-ITD (r=0.650, P<0.001), MLL-PTD (r=0.728, P<0.001), NPM1mut (r=0.599, P<0.001) and RUNX1mut (r=0.889, P<0.001). Moreover, a reduction in BAALC expression after the second cycle of induction chemotherapy was associated with improved EFS. Thus, our data underline the utility of BAALC expression as a marker for prognostic risk stratification and detection of residual disease in CN-AML.","['Weber, S', 'Alpermann, T', 'Dicker, F', 'Jeromin, S', 'Nadarajah, N', 'Eder, C', 'Fasan, A', 'Kohlmann, A', 'Meggendorfer, M', 'Haferlach, C', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, T', 'Schnittger, S']","['Weber S', 'Alpermann T', 'Dicker F', 'Jeromin S', 'Nadarajah N', 'Eder C', 'Fasan A', 'Kohlmann A', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Haferlach C', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140110,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3913940,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/01/15 06:01,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201371 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.71 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Jan 10;4:e173. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we explored the association between expanded TCR-Vbeta and TCR-Valpha clonotypes in a cohort of 26 CD8(+)/TCRalphabeta(+) T-LGL leukemia patients, in conjunction with the HLA-ABC genotype, to find indications for common antigenic stimuli. In addition, we applied purpose-built sophisticated computational tools for an in-depth evaluation of clustering of TCRbeta (TCRB) complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) amino-acid LGL clonotypes. We observed a lack of clear TCRA and TCRB CDR3 homology in CD8(+)/TCRalphabeta(+) T-LGL, with only low level similarity between small numbers of cases. This is in strong contrast to the homology that is seen in CD4(+)/TCRalphabeta(+) T-LGL and TCRgammadelta(+) T-LGL and thus underlines the idea that the LGL types have different etiopathogenesis. The heterogeneity of clonal CD8(+)/TCRalphabeta(+) T-LGL proliferations might in fact suggest that multiple pathogens or autoantigens are involved.","['Sandberg, Y', 'Kallemeijn, M J', 'Dik, W A', 'Tielemans, D', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L M', 'van Gastel-Mol, E J', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Pol, Y', 'Darzentas, N', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Langerak, A W']","['Sandberg Y', 'Kallemeijn MJ', 'Dik WA', 'Tielemans D', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Gastel-Mol EJ', 'Szczepanski T', 'Pol Y', 'Darzentas N', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Langerak AW']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands [2] Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Agrobiotechnology, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140110,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3913939,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/01/15 06:01,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201370 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.70 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Jan 10;4:e172. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-nine patients (AML=29, MDS=10) received azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously (days 1-5) and oral panobinostat (starting on day 5, thrice weekly for seven doses) in 28-day cycles until toxicity or disease progression. Dose-limiting toxicities during the phase Ib stage were observed in 0/4 patients receiving 10 mg panobinostat, in 1/7 patients (fatigue) receiving 20 mg, in 1/6 patients (fatigue) receiving 30 mg and in 4/5 patients (fatigue, syncope, hyponatremia and somnolence) receiving 40 mg.

These included the formation of ALT-associated PML (promyelocytic leukemia) bodies (APBs), the presence of extrachromosomal telomeric DNA species, an elevated frequency of telomeric sister chromatid exchanges (t-SCE) events and intertelomeric exchange of an integrated tag. The induction of ALT characteristics in this setting led to the simultaneous suppression of telomerase. We determined that ALT induction is positively regulated by the proteins RAD17 and BLM and negatively regulated by EXO1 and DNA2. The induction of ALT phenotypes as a consequence of ASF1 depletion strongly supports the hypothesis that ALT is a consequence of histone management dysfunction.","[""O'Sullivan, Roderick J"", 'Arnoult, Nausica', 'Lackner, Daniel H', 'Oganesian, Liana', 'Haggblom, Candy', 'Corpet, Armelle', 'Almouzni, Genevieve', 'Karlseder, Jan']","[""O'Sullivan RJ"", 'Arnoult N', 'Lackner DH', 'Oganesian L', 'Haggblom C', 'Corpet A', 'Almouzni G', 'Karlseder J']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA.', '1] Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Paris, France.

APL is the only malignancy definitively cured by targeted therapies: retinoic acid (RA) and/or arsenic trioxide, which both trigger PML-RARA degradation through nonoverlapping pathways. Yet, the cellular and molecular determinants of treatment efficacy remain disputed. We demonstrate that a functional Pml-transformation-related protein 53 (Trp53) axis is required to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells in a mouse model of APL. Upon RA-induced PML-RARA degradation, normal Pml elicits NB reformation and induces a Trp53 response exhibiting features of senescence but not apoptosis, ultimately abrogating APL-initiating activity. Apart from triggering PML-RARA degradation, arsenic trioxide also targets normal PML to enhance NB reformation, which may explain its clinical potency, alone or with RA. This Pml-Trp53 checkpoint initiated by therapy-triggered NB restoration is specific for PML-RARA-driven APL, but not the RA-resistant promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-RARA variant. Yet, as NB biogenesis is druggable, it could be therapeutically exploited in non-APL malignancies.","['Ablain, Julien', 'Rice, Kim', 'Soilihi, Hassane', 'de Reynies, Aurelien', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'de The, Hugues']","['Ablain J', 'Rice K', 'Soilihi H', 'de Reynies A', 'Minucci S', 'de The H']","[""1] Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.

Several antineoplastic drugs (including cyclophosphamide) have been classified as carcinogenic to humans. This study aims to assess the leukemia risk of occupational exposure to cyclophosphamide. Average task frequencies from the population of oncology nurses in the Netherlands and task-based dermal exposure intensities were used to calculate oncology nurses' dermal exposure levels. A dermal absorption model in combination with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was used to assess the delivered dose of cyclophosphamide and its active metabolites in the bone marrow. This delivered dose was subsequently related to pharmacodynamic and epidemiological information from a longitudinal study with cyclophosphamide-treated patients to estimate the excess lifetime leukemia risk at age 80 for Dutch oncology nurses after 40 years of exposure to cyclophosphamide. The excess lifetime leukemia risk at age 80 of an exposed oncology nurse after 40 years of dermal exposure to cyclophosphamide was estimated to be 1.04 per million oncology nurses. This risk could potentially increase to a maximum of 154 per million if a nurse performs all cyclophosphamide-related tasks with the maximum frequency (as observed in this population) and is exposed to maximum exposure intensities for each task without using protective gloves for 40 years. This study indicates that the risk of an oncology nurse in a Dutch hospital with an average dermal exposure to cyclophosphamide is well below the maximum tolerable risk of one extra death from cancer per 250 deaths after 40 years of occupational exposure, and that this level is not exceeded in a worst-case scenario.","['Fransman, Wouter', 'Kager, Hans', 'Meijster, Tim', 'Heederik, Dick', 'Kromhout, Hans', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Blaauboer, Bas J']","['Fransman W', 'Kager H', 'Meijster T', 'Heederik D', 'Kromhout H', 'Portengen L', 'Blaauboer BJ']","['1.

However, the underlying mechanism and the biological relevance of RIG-I expression to the maintenance of leukemogenic potential are poorly understood. Here, we show that RIG-I, without priming by foreign RNA, inhibits the Src-facilitated activation of AKT-mTOR in AML cells. Moreover, in a group of primary human AML blasts, RIG-I reduction renders the Src family kinases hyperactive in promoting AKT activation. Mechanistically, a PxxP motif in RIG-I, upon the N-terminal CARDs' association with the Src SH1 domain, competes with the AKT PxxP motif for recognizing the Src SH3 domain. In accordance, mutating PxxP motif prevents Rig-I from inhibiting AKT activation, cytokine-stimulated myeloid progenitor proliferation, and in vivo repopulating capacity of leukemia cells. Collectively, our data suggest an antileukemia activity of RIG-I via competitively inhibiting Src/AKT association.","['Li, Xian-Yang', 'Jiang, Lin-Jia', 'Chen, Lei', 'Ding, Meng-Lei', 'Guo, He-Zhou', 'Zhang, Wu', 'Zhang, Hong-Xin', 'Ma, Xiao-Dan', 'Liu, Xiang-Zhen', 'Xi, Xiao-Dong', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Zhu, Jiang']","['Li XY', 'Jiang LJ', 'Chen L', 'Ding ML', 'Guo HZ', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang HX', 'Ma XD', 'Liu XZ', 'Xi XD', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Zhu J']","[""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China; Shanghai E-Institute for Model Organisms, Shanghai 200025, People's Republic of China.

There is a need to identify at the outset those patients with SR-aALL who are likely to have shorter RFS and OS, so they can be treated more aggressively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Flow cytometric data of 81 patients with SR-aALL treated with a standardized protocol were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-two patients (40%) relapsed; the median RFS and OS were 12.5 months (range, 1-136 months) and 30 months (range, 3-235 months), respectively. Twenty-six patients survived >/= 48 months. RESULTS: Expression of myeloid antigen CD13, using the conventional >/= 20% threshold and a lower >/= 5% threshold, was seen in 17 (29%) of 59 and 29 (49%) of 59 patients, respectively, whereas dual expression of CD13 and CD33 was seen in 8 patients. CD13 positivity at >/= 20% and >/= 5% threshold was associated with a shorter RFS (P = .0158 and P < .0001, respectively) and OS (P = .0072 and P < .0001, respectively). Dual expression of CD13 (at >/= 5% or >/= 20% threshold) and CD33 was associated with inferior OS (P = .0038 and P = .0032, respectively) and RFS (P = .0705 and P = .2516, respectively). For >/= 20% and >/= 5% threshold of positivity, 16 of 42 and 28 of 42 who survived < 48 months were positive, compared with 1 of 17 and 1 of 17 who survived >/= 48 months (P = .0133 and P < .0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Aberrant expression of CD13 in >/= 5% of blasts of patients with SR-aALL is an adverse prognostic factor, delineating a subgroup of patients with SR-aALL that should be considered for more aggressive treatment.","['Dalal, Bakul I', 'Al Mugairi, Areej', 'Pi, Steven', 'Lee, Soo Yeon', 'Khare, Nikisha S', 'Pal, Jason', 'Bryant, Adam', 'Vakil, Alok P', 'Lau, Sally', 'Abou Mourad, Yasser R']","['Dalal BI', 'Al Mugairi A', 'Pi S', 'Lee SY', 'Khare NS', 'Pal J', 'Bryant A', 'Vakil AP', 'Lau S', 'Abou Mourad YR']","['Division of Laboratory Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Drawbacks to transplantation include toxicity from chemotherapy/radiation conditioning regimens, additional toxicity from graft versus host disease, and reliance on appropriate human leukocyte antigen matched donors. Newer modalities with increased specificity of donor cells to tumor cells in addition to therapies that do not require engraftment for anti-tumor effect reduce the risk of graft versus host disease and may create a more robust graft versus leukemia response. Without the need for engraftment, or at the very least in the absence of a 100% engraftment requirement, conditioning regimens may be minimized. Three methods of adoptive immunotherapy that may offer some of these advantages over traditional transplantation are donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells (CAR T cells), and cellular immunotherapy. DLIs and cellular therapy consist of transfusing T lymphocytes from the donor to recipient in an unmanipulated form. Alternatively, donor T lymphocytes can be modified with addition of chimeric antigen receptors for specific antigen directed killing of tumor cells. Significant responses and survival benefit have been reported with these modalities. Herein, we review the mechanisms for these newer adoptive immune therapies, clinical indications for their use, and potential future directions.","['Mantripragada, Kalyan', 'Reagan, John L', 'Quesenberry, Peter J', 'Fast, Loren D']","['Mantripragada K', 'Reagan JL', 'Quesenberry PJ', 'Fast LD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert School of Medicine, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Models, Immunological', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2014 Jan;17(91):15-24.,,,,['8P20GM103468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the laboratory performance for discrimination of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells from other types of leukemia cells and clinical value of LUC and DNI parameters in bone marrow (BM) samples of patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: A total of 73 BM samples of patients with various type of acute leukemia were analyzed. LUC and DNI parameters were determined by an automated hematology analyzer (ADVIA 120; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, New York, NY, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U methods. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard model were used to evaluate the clinical implication. RESULTS: There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between APL group and other group in the DNI and LUC values except for DNI between APL group and non-APL myeloid leukemia group. The area under curve of LUC was larger than that of DNI from the ROC analysis for discrimination between APL group and other group. High LUC value was associated with the increased risk of adverse outcomes and the worse overall survival in patients with acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Delta neutrophil index and LUC in BM showed discriminating power of APL cells from other leukemia cells.","['Jang, M J', 'Choi, H W', 'Lee, S Y', 'Lee, O J', 'Kim, H R', 'Shin, J H', 'Suh, S P', 'Ryang, D W', 'Shin, M G']","['Jang MJ', 'Choi HW', 'Lee SY', 'Lee OJ', 'Kim HR', 'Shin JH', 'Suh SP', 'Ryang DW', 'Shin MG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'ROC Curve', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2013/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12183 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Oct;36(5):531-40. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12183.

Clofarabine is a hybrid of fludarabine and cladribine, designed to overcome the pharmacologic limitations associated with its predecessors, while retaining their beneficial properties. In addition to providing a valuable treatment option for pediatric patients with ALL, clofarabine alone and in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) has demonstrated substantial activity against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), thus rendering this agent a potential therapeutic option for MDS. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the pharmacology and clinical activity of clofarabine in MDS, as well as its emerging role in the treatment of MDS. Publications in English were selected from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database, as well articles of interest from bibliographies and abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials. EXPERT OPINION: DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for many patients with MDS who require treatment. Although these agents are very well tolerated and represent a significant advancement in the treatment of MDS by improving transfusion requirements and prolonging survival in various subgroups of patients, response rates are modest and the duration of response is short. In addition to providing a valuable treatment option for pediatric ALL patients, clofarabine has substantial activity against MDS and is well tolerated by elderly patients, thus rendering it a potential therapeutic option.","['Bryan, Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Prescott, Hillary', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Bryan J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Prescott H', 'Jabbour E']","['The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia , 1515 Holcombe Blvd. Box 428.

Recent data indicated that regulatory T (Treg) cells might relate to GVHD, and such functions might be mediated by certain T-cell receptor (TCR) subfamily of Treg cells. Thus, we analyzed the distribution and clonality of the TCR Valpha and Vbeta repertoire of Treg cells from leukemia patients with and without GVHD after allo-HSCT. Numerous TCR Valpha subfamilies, including Valpha1, Valpha9, Valpha13, Valpha16-19, and Valpha24-29, were absent in Treg cells after allo-HSCT. The usage numbers for the TCR Valpha and Vbeta subfamilies in Treg cells from patients without GVHD appeared more widely. The expression frequencies of Valpha10 or Valpha20 between both groups were significantly different. Moreover, the expression frequency of TCR Vbeta2 subfamily in patients without GVHD was significantly higher than that in patients with GVHD. Oligoclonally expanded TCR Valpha and Vbeta Treg cells were identified in a few samples in both groups. Restricted utilization of the Valpha and Vbeta subfamilies and the absence of some important TCR rearrangements in Treg cells may be related to GVHD due to a lower regulating function of Treg subfamilies.","['Jin, Zhenyi', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Jin Z', 'Wu X', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Liu Q', 'Li Y']","['1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140111,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3942685,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2013.2277 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2014 Mar;33(3):182-8. doi: 10.1089/dna.2013.2277.

To deliver cross-linked NoxaBH3 peptides selectively into cancer cells for enhanced efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity, here we report the conjugation of the NoxaBH3 peptides with the extracellular ubiquitin, a recently identified endogenous ligand for CXCR4, a chemokine receptor overexpressed in cancer cells. The resulting ubiquitin-NoxaBH3 peptide conjugates showed increased inhibitory activity against Mcl-1 and selective killing of the CXCR4-expressing cancer cells. The successful delivery of the NoxaBH3 peptides by ubiquitin into cancer cells suggests that the ubiquitin/CXCR4 axis may serve as a general route for the targeted delivery of anticancer agents.","['Muppidi, Avinash', 'Doi, Kenichiro', 'Edwardraja, Selvakumar', 'Pulavarti, Surya V S R K', 'Szyperski, Thomas', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Lin, Qing']","['Muppidi A', 'Doi K', 'Edwardraja S', 'Pulavarti SV', 'Szyperski T', 'Wang HG', 'Lin Q']","['Department of Chemistry, State University of New York at Buffalo , Buffalo, New York 14260-3000, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140122,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Ubiquitin/*chemistry']",PMC3974624,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc4005574 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2014 Feb 19;25(2):424-32. doi: 10.1021/bc4005574.

However, the function of Eps8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unclear. Thus, this study aims to develop a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Eps8 in AML. METHODS: Eps8 was amplified and cloned into pMD18-T to generate the recombinant plasmid pMD18-T/Eps8 as standard DNA for the establishment of real-time quantitative PCR. This assay was used to detect the expression level of Eps8 in bone marrow samples from AML patients and healthy volunteers (control group). RESULTS: The limit of detection achieved using this standard was 100 copies, which was 10 times more sensitive than that achieved using conventional PCR, indicating high sensitivity. Melting curve analysis demonstrated that the primers designed for the established real-time quantitative PCR assay were specific and available. The expression level of Eps8 in the AML patients increased compared with that in the control group (p = 0.013). Furthermore, the expression level of Eps8 showed significant correlation with the complete remission rate of AML patients to chemotherapy (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The established assay is useful in detecting the expression level of Eps8. The results suggest that Eps8 may serve as a prognostic factor of responsiveness to chemotherapy in AML patients.","['Wang, Lei', 'Cai, Song-Hao', 'Xiong, Wen-Yan', 'He, Yan-Jie', 'Deng, Lan', 'Li, Yu-Hua']","['Wang L', 'Cai SH', 'Xiong WY', 'He YJ', 'Deng L', 'Li YH']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (EPS8 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Limit of Detection', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2014/01/15 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2014/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/clin.lab.2013.121107 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2013;59(11-12):1261-9. doi: 10.7754/clin.lab.2013.121107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The open circulatory system of Drosophila makes haemocytes ideal signal mediators to cells and tissues in response to events such as infection and wounding. The application of recently developed and sophisticated genetic tools to the relatively simple genome of Drosophila has made the fly a popular system for modeling human tumorigensis and metastasis. Drosophila is now used for screening and investigation of genes implicated in human leukemia and also in modeling development of solid tumors. This second line of research offers promising opportunities to determine the seemingly conflicting roles of blood cells in tumor progression and invasion. This review provides an overview of the signaling pathways conserved in Drosophila during haematopoiesis, haemostasis, innate immunity, wound healing and inflammation.

Remaining issue on CML includes finding and targeting of the key genes responsible for self-renewal and proliferation of LSCs. Nucleostemin (NS) is a new protein localized in the nucleolus of most stem cells and tumor cells which regulates their self-renewal and cell cycle progression. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of NS knocking down in K562 cell line as an in vitro model of CML. METHODS: NS gene silencing was performed using a specific small interfering RNA (NS-siRNA). The gene expression level of NS was evaluated by RT-PCR. The viability and growth rate of K562 cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion test. Cell cycle distribution of the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results showed that NS knocking down inhibited proliferation and viability of K562 cells in a time-dependent manner. Cell cycle studies revealed that NS depletion resulted in G(1) cell cycle arrest at short times of transfection (24 h) followed with apoptosis at longer times (48 and 72 h), suggest that post-G1 arrest apoptosis is occurred in K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results point to essential role of NS in K562 cells, thus, this gene might be considered as a promising target for treatment of CML.","['Seyed-Gogani, Negin', 'Rahmati, Marveh', 'Zarghami, Nosratollah', 'Asvadi-Kermani, Iraj', 'Hoseinpour-Feyzi, Mohammad Ali', 'Moosavi, Mohammad Amin']","['Seyed-Gogani N', 'Rahmati M', 'Zarghami N', 'Asvadi-Kermani I', 'Hoseinpour-Feyzi MA', 'Moosavi MA']","['Department of Zoology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran. ; Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Zoology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Zoology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran. ; Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran. ; National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131223,Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,PMC3885370,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/01/11 06:01,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5681/apb.2014.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2014;4(1):55-60. doi: 10.5681/apb.2014.009.

METHODS: 56 cases of de novo AML (2010-2012) diagnosed by using an acute panel of monoclonal antibodies by multiparametric flowcytometry. Immunophenotyping was done on fresh bone marrow aspirate and/or peripheral blood samples using the acute panel of MoAbs is stained with Phycoerythrin (PE) /fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Allophycocyanin (APC) and Peridinin-chlorophyll protein complex (perCP). We investigated Co-expression of lymphoid-associated markers CD2, CD3, CD7, CD 10, CD19, CD20 and CD22 in myeloblasts. RESULTS: Out of the 56 cases, 32 (57.1%) showed AP. CD7 was positive in 72.7% of cases in M1 and 28.5% in M2 but M3 and M4 cases lacked this marker. We detected CD2 in 58.35 of M1cases, 21.40% of M2 cases, 33.3 of M3 and 20% of M5; but M4 patients lacked this marker. The CBC analysis demonstrated a wide range of haemoglobin concentration, Platelet and WBC count which varied from normal to anaemia, thrombocytopenia to thrombocytosis and leukopenia to hyper leukocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that CD7 and CD2 were the most common aberrant marker in Iranian patients with AML. However, we are not find any significant correlation between aberrant phenotype changing and MRD in our population. Taken together, this findings help to provide new insights in to the investigation of other aberrant phenotypes that may play roles in diagnosis and therapeutic of AML.","['Jahedi, Mehdi', 'Shamsasenjan, Karim', 'Sanaat, Zohreh', 'Aliparasti, Mohammadreza', 'Almasi, Shohreh', 'Mohamadian, Mozhdeh', 'Nejati, Babak', 'Kamalifar, Amir', 'Movassaghpour, Ali Akbar']","['Jahedi M', 'Shamsasenjan K', 'Sanaat Z', 'Aliparasti M', 'Almasi S', 'Mohamadian M', 'Nejati B', 'Kamalifar A', 'Movassaghpour AA']","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Students Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131223,Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,PMC3885367,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/01/11 06:01,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5681/apb.2014.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2014;4(1):43-7. doi: 10.5681/apb.2014.007.

Its anticancer activity has also been recently reported on different solid tumors, however no anti-leukemic activity of this plant has been reported. Thus the present study assesses the in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative and apoptotic potentials of E. longifolia on K-562 leukemic cell line. The K-562 cells (purchased from ATCC) were isolated from patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) were treated with the various fractions (TAF273, F3 and F4) of E. longifolia root methanolic extract at various concentrations and time intervals and the anti-proliferative activity assessed by MTS assay. Flow cytometry was used to assess the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Nude mice injected subcutaneously with 10(7) K-562 cells were used to study the anti-leukemic activity of TAF273 in vivo. TAF273, F3 and F4 showed various degrees of growth inhibition with IC50 values of 19, 55 and 62 microg/ml, respectively. TAF273 induced apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner.

In a mouse model, it has been shown that mature T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (MTCLL) is not induced upon transplantation of mature, TCR polyclonal wild-type (WT) T cells, transduced with gammaretroviral vectors encoding potent T-cell oncogenes, into RAG1-deficient recipients. However, further studies demonstrated that quasi-monoclonal T cells treated with the same protocol readily induced MTCLL in the recipient mice. It has been hypothesized that in the TCR polyclonal situation, outgrowth of preleukemic cells and subsequent conversion to overt malignancy is suppressed through regulation of clonal abundances on a per-clone basis due to interactions between TCRs and self-peptide-MHC-complexes (spMHCs), while these mechanisms fail in the quasi-monoclonal situation. To quantitatively study this hypothesis, we applied a mathematical modeling approach. In particular, we developed a novel ordinary differential equation model of T-cell homeostasis, in which T-cell fate depends on spMHC-TCR-interaction-triggered stimulatory signals from antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Based on our mathematical modeling approach, we identified parameter configurations of our model, which consistently explain the observed phenomena. Our results suggest that the preleukemic cells are less competent than healthy competitor cells in acquiring survival stimuli from APCs, but that proliferation of these preleukemic cells is less dependent on survival stimuli from APCs. These predictions now call for experimental validation.","['Gerdes, Sebastian', 'Newrzela, Sebastian', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'von Laer, Dorothee', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Roeder, Ingo']","['Gerdes S', 'Newrzela S', 'Glauche I', 'von Laer D', 'Hansmann ML', 'Roeder I']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus , Dresden , Germany.', 'Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, Goethe-University Hospital Frankfurt , Frankfurt , Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus , Dresden , Germany.', 'Department of Hygiene, Medical University Innsbruck , Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, Goethe-University Hospital Frankfurt , Frankfurt , Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus , Dresden , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131121,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC3836208,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/01/11 06:01,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2013.00380 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2013 Nov 21;4:380. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00380. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MTCL', 'T-cell homeostasis', 'T-cell niche', 'gene therapy', 'mature T-cell lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied factors associated with medical care utilization among 465 AYA cancer survivors in the AYA Health Outcomes and Patient Experience Study, a cohort of 15 to 39 year olds recently diagnosed with germ cell cancer, lymphoma, sarcoma, or acute lymphocytic leukemia. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression methods were used. RESULTS: Most AYA cancer survivors (95%), who were 15-35 months post diagnosis, received medical care in the past 12 months and 17% were undergoing cancer treatment. In multivariate analyses, compared with AYAs with no cancer-related medical visits in the previous year, AYAs receiving cancer-related care were more likely to currently have health insurance (odds ratio (OR) = 4.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7-13.8) or have had health insurance in the past year (OR = 4.0; 95% CI = 0.99-16.3). Cancer recurrence, lacking employment, and negative changes in self-reported general health were associated with ongoing cancer treatment versus other cancer-related medical care. Eleven percent of all AYAs and 25% of AYAs who did not receive medical care in the past 12 months lost health insurance between the initial and follow-up surveys. CONCLUSION: AYA cancer survivors with health insurance were much more likely to receive cancer-related medical care than those without insurance. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Despite the need for post-treatment medical care, lacking health insurance is a barrier to receiving any medical care among AYAs.","['Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Tao, Li', 'DeRouen, Mindy C', 'Wu, Xiao-Cheng', 'Prasad, Pinki', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Shnorhavorian, Margarett', 'Zebrack, Brad J', 'Chu, Roland', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Smith, Ashley W', 'Parsons, Helen M']","['Keegan TH', 'Tao L', 'DeRouen MC', 'Wu XC', 'Prasad P', 'Lynch CF', 'Shnorhavorian M', 'Zebrack BJ', 'Chu R', 'Harlan LC', 'Smith AW', 'Parsons HM']","['Cancer Prevention Institute of California, 2201 Walnut Avenue, Suite 300, Fremont, CA, 94538, USA, theresa.keegan@cpic.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140110,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",PMC4074375,2014/01/11 06:00,2015/01/31 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-013-0332-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2014 Jun;8(2):282-92. doi: 10.1007/s11764-013-0332-4.

Kinase domain mutations are a common mechanism of resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), yet the mechanism of resistance in the absence of mutations remains unclear. We tested proteins from the bone marrow microenvironment and found that FGF2 promotes resistance to imatinib in vitro. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was uniquely capable of promoting growth in both short- and long-term assays through the FGF receptor 3/RAS/c-RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Resistance could be overcome with ponatinib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL and FGF receptor. Clinically, we identified CML patients without kinase domain mutations who were resistant to multiple ABL kinase inhibitors and responded to ponatinib treatment. In comparison to CML patients with kinase domain mutations, these patients had increased FGF2 in their bone marrow when analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, FGF2 in the marrow decreased concurrently with response to ponatinib, further suggesting that FGF2-mediated resistance is interrupted by FGF receptor inhibition. These results illustrate the clinical importance of ligand-induced resistance to kinase inhibitors and support an approach of developing rational inhibitor combinations to circumvent resistance.","['Traer, Elie', 'Javidi-Sharifi, Nathalie', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Dunlap, Jennifer', 'English, Isabel', 'Martinez, Jacqueline', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Wong, Melissa', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Traer E', 'Javidi-Sharifi N', 'Agarwal A', 'Dunlap J', 'English I', 'Martinez J', 'Tyner JW', 'Wong M', 'Druker BJ']",['Knight Cancer Institute.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/metabolism', 'Pyridazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics']",PMC3945862,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35925-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-518381 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 6;123(10):1516-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-518381.

The most common type, internal tandem duplication (ITD), confers poor prognosis. We report for the first time on TTT-3002, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is one of the most potent FLT3 inhibitors discovered to date. Studies using human FLT3/ITD mutant leukemia cell lines revealed the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation is from 100 to 250 pM. The proliferation IC50 for TTT-3002 in these same cells was from 490 to 920 pM. TTT-3002 also showed potent activity when tested against the most frequently occurring FLT3-activating point mutation, FLT3/D835Y, against which many current TKIs are ineffective. These findings were validated in vivo by using mouse models of FLT3-associated AML. Survival and tumor burden of mice in several FLT3/ITD transplantation models is significantly improved by administration of TTT-3002 via oral dosing. Finally, we demonstrated that TTT-3002 is cytotoxic to leukemic blasts isolated from FLT3/ITD-expressing AML patients, while displaying minimal toxicity to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from healthy blood and bone marrow donors. Therefore, TTT-3002 has demonstrated preclinical potential as a promising new FLT3 TKI in the treatment of FLT3-mutant AML.","['Ma, Hayley', 'Nguyen, Bao', 'Li, Li', 'Greenblatt, Sarah', 'Williams, Allen', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Levis, Mark', 'Rudek, Michelle', 'Duffield, Amy', 'Small, Donald']","['Ma H', 'Nguyen B', 'Li L', 'Greenblatt S', 'Williams A', 'Zhao M', 'Levis M', 'Rudek M', 'Duffield A', 'Small D']",['Departments of Oncology.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (TTT-3002)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Carbazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3945863,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35926-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-08-523035 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 6;123(10):1525-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-08-523035.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 64 consecutive first relapsed APL patients (12 with molecular relapse and 52 with hematologic relapse). Patients received re-induction with intravenous ATO-based regimens. Patients who achieved a CR2 were offered further courses of alternating ATO/conventional chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation (SCT). With a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 6-57) in the molecular relapsed subgroup, the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 81.5 % and 100 %, respectively. With a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 0-129) in the hematologic relapse group, the 3-year RFS and OS rates were 57.1 % and 72.1 %, respectively. Furthermore, in the hematologic relapse group, we compared the outcome between relapsed patients after previous ATO therapy (n = 20) with those who did not receive prior ATO therapy (n = 32). The CR2 rate was 80 % (16/20) vs. 93.8 % (30/32), (p = 0.189). However, the relapse rate was 68.8 % (11/16) vs. 33.3 % (10/30), (p = 0.03). The 4-year OS rate was 62.4 % vs. 71.2 %, (p = 0.816), and the 4-year RFS rate was 29.8 % vs. 66.2 % (p = 0.023). The results indicate that, irrespective of frontline therapy with ATO, salvage therapy with an ATO-based regimen remains effective. However, the long-term survival for those patients who received previous ATO-based treatment was inferior compared to those who did not receive prior ATO. In addition, the alternating ATO/chemotherapy strategy can be a post-remission treatment option in a subset of patients.","['Lou, Yinjun', 'Suo, Shanshan', 'Tong, Yin', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Qian, Wenbin', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Mai, Wenyuan', 'Huang, Jian', 'Yu, Wenjuan', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lou Y', 'Suo S', 'Tong Y', 'Tong H', 'Qian W', 'Meng H', 'Mai W', 'Huang J', 'Yu W', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-2000-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Jun;93(6):941-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-2000-1.

In addition, monitoring of patients under chemotherapy leukemia treatment (CHLT) was studied. Blood samples were obtained from seven patients who were clinically diagnosed with three leukemia types and 21 healthy volunteers. In addition, other five leukemia patients were monitored during the CHLT, two patients were declared healthy, one patient suspended it; the health of the other two patients worsened, and no improvement was observed along CHLT. The serum samples were put under an Olympus microscope integrated to the Raman system, and several points were chosen for the Raman measurement. The Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman system is equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled detector and a laser of 830 nm with a power irradiation of 17 mW. It is shown that the serum samples from patient with leukemia and from the control group can be discriminated when multivariate statistical methods of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are applied to their Raman spectra obtaining two large clusters corresponding to the control and leukemia serum samples and three clusters inside the leukemia group associated with the three leukemia types. The major differences between leukemia and control spectra were at 1,338 (Trp, alpha-helix, phospholipids), 1,447 (lipids), 1,523 (beta-carotene), 1,556 (Trp), 1,587 (protein, Tyr), 1,603 (Tyr, Phe), and 1,654 (proteins, amide I, alpha-helix, phospholipids) cm(-1), where these peaks were less intense in the leukemia spectrum. Minor differences occurred at 661 (glutathione), 890 (glutathione), 973 (glucosamine), 1,126 (protein, phospholipid C-C str), 1,160 (beta-carotene), 1,174 (Trp, Phe), 1,208 (Trp), 1,246 (amide III), 1,380 (glucosamine), and 1,404 (glutathione) cm(-1). Leukemia spectrum showed a peak at 917 cm(-1) associated with glutathione, but it was absent in the control spectrum. The results suggest that the Raman spectroscopy and PCA could be a technique with a strong potential of support for current techniques to detect and identify the different leukemia types by using a serum sample. Nevertheless, with the construction of a data library integrated with a large number of leukemia and control Raman spectra obtained from a wide range of healthy and leukemic population, the Raman-PCA technique could be converted into a new technique for minimally invasive real-time diagnosis of leukemia from serum samples. In addition, complementary results suggest that using these techniques is possible to monitor CHLT.","['Gonzalez-Solis, Jose Luis', 'Martinez-Espinosa, Juan Carlos', 'Salgado-Roman, Juan Manuel', 'Palomares-Anda, Pascual']","['Gonzalez-Solis JL', 'Martinez-Espinosa JC', 'Salgado-Roman JM', 'Palomares-Anda P']","['Biophysics and Biomedical Sciences Laboratory, Centro Universitario de los Lagos, Universidad de Guadalajara, Enrique Diaz de Leon 1144, Paseo de la Montana, CP 47460, Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco, Mexico, jluis0968@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,England,Lasers Med Sci,Lasers in medical science,8611515,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Discriminant Analysis', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Principal Component Analysis', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/11 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10103-013-1515-y [doi]'],ppublish,Lasers Med Sci. 2014 May;29(3):1241-9. doi: 10.1007/s10103-013-1515-y.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted analyzing clinical data of patients testing positive for human herpes virus 6 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction following hematopoietic stem cell transplant from 1 January 1998 to 1 October 2011. Data retrieved were used to describe the clinical course and outcome of human herpes virus 6 positive hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. RESULTS: Sixty patients were identified who tested positive for human herpes virus 6 by polymerase chain reaction following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. A high proportion of patients were identified in this cohort with acute myeloid leukemia (28.3%), active disease (65%), transplanted with a matched unrelated donor (30%), >/= 1 antigen mismatched (28.3%) matched unrelated donor, or an umbilical cord graft (25%), and those who received antithymocyte globulin (42.4%). Thirty-eight (63.3%) patients were treated for human herpes virus 6 with foscarnet alone or in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin, whereas 18 (30%) did not require treatment survival at Day 100 was 73.3%. CONCLUSION: This study suggests human herpes virus 6 reactivation occurs shortly after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (median of 25 days (interquartile range, 20-31.75) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Many potential risk factors are described in this report. Treatment of human herpes virus 6 predominately consisted of foscarnet with or without intravenous immunoglobulin; however, treatment of human herpes virus 6 was not always warranted. Furthermore, the effect of treatment on patient outcomes is uncertain.","['Perissinotti, Anthony J', 'Gulbis, Alison', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Howell, Joshua']","['Perissinotti AJ', 'Gulbis A', 'Shpall EJ', 'Howell J']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA ajperis@med.umich.edu.', 'Division of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Oncology Content, Content and Clinical Services, McKesson Specialty Health, The Woodlands, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140109,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '364P9RVW4X (Foscarnet)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Foscarnet/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Roseolovirus Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*virology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viral Load', '*Virus Activation', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155213519837 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155213519837 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2015 Apr;21(2):85-92. doi: 10.1177/1078155213519837.

It was generally recognized that leukemia secondary to chemotherapy was due to the use of alkylating agents in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Recently, many types of chemotherapeutic agents have been used in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies in addition to ovarian cancer. We analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with recent onset of secondary leukemia after the treatment of gynecologic cancer to consider the diagnosis and management of secondary leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical charts and follow-up data of patients with gynecologic malignancies treated in the past 20 years. During this period, 2482 newly diagnosed invasive gynecologic cancers were treated in our institution. All patients with secondary leukemia were analyzed for clinical background, latency period (interval between the diagnosis of primary carcinoma and the development of leukemia), treatment, and outcome. We also reviewed the literature for secondary leukemia under gynecology using the PubMed. RESULTS: Four patients were found to have developed secondary leukemia after the treatment of gynecologic malignancies during this period. The cumulative risk of secondary leukemia was approximately 0.38%. All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy. Two patients received combination chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation, and 1 of these 2 patients lived more than 6 years but died of recurrent ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Long survival time might be expected in patients who show complete response to bone marrow transplantation and/or combination chemotherapy for secondary leukemia. In recent years, we have aggressively used various types of anticancer drugs for the treatment of not only ovarian cancer but also uterine cervical cancer and endometrial cancer. Physicians need to keep in mind the risk of secondary leukemia in the follow-up of long-term survivors after several courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['Shimada, Takako', 'Saito, Toshiaki', 'Okadome, Masao', 'Shimamoto, Kumi', 'Ariyoshi, Kazuya', 'Eto, Takako', 'Tomita, Yui', 'Kodama, Keisuke']","['Shimada T', 'Saito T', 'Okadome M', 'Shimamoto K', 'Ariyoshi K', 'Eto T', 'Tomita Y', 'Kodama K']","['*Gynecology Service, National Kyushu Cancer Center; and daggerDepartment of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyusyu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/diagnosis/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/diagnosis/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/IGC.0000000000000045 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2014 Feb;24(2):178-83. doi: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000000045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LMO2 is made up of two LIM only domains (thus it is a LIM-only protein) and forms a bridge in a multi-protein complex. We have studied the mechanism of formation of this complex using a single domain antibody fragment that inhibits LMO2 by sequestering it in a non-functional form. The crystal structure of LMO2 with this antibody fragment has been solved revealing a conformational difference in the positioning and angle between the two LIM domains compared with its normal binding. This contortion occurs by bending at a central helical region of LMO2. This is a unique mechanism for inhibiting an intracellular protein function and the structural contusion implies a model in which newly synthesized, intrinsically disordered LMO2 binds to a partner protein nucleating further interactions and suggests approaches for therapeutic targeting of LMO2.","['Sewell, H', 'Tanaka, T', 'El Omari, K', 'Mancini, E J', 'Cruz, A', 'Fernandez-Fuentes, N', 'Chambers, J', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Sewell H', 'Tanaka T', 'El Omari K', 'Mancini EJ', 'Cruz A', 'Fernandez-Fuentes N', 'Chambers J', 'Rabbitts TH']","[""1] Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine MRC Molecular Haematology Unit University of Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford OX3 9DS, UK [2] Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Wellcome Trust Brenner Building St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK [3] [4]."", ""1] Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Wellcome Trust Brenner Building St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK [2] [3]."", '1] Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics Division of Structural Biology University of Oxford Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN, UK [2].', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics Division of Structural Biology University of Oxford Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN, UK.', ""1] Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine MRC Molecular Haematology Unit University of Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford OX3 9DS, UK [2] Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Wellcome Trust Brenner Building St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK."", ""1] Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Wellcome Trust Brenner Building St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK [2]."", ""1] Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine MRC Molecular Haematology Unit University of Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford OX3 9DS, UK [2] Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Wellcome Trust Brenner Building St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK."", ""1] Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine MRC Molecular Haematology Unit University of Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford OX3 9DS, UK [2] Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Wellcome Trust Brenner Building St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*chemistry/genetics', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3887373,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['srep03643 [pii]', '10.1038/srep03643 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Jan 10;4:3643. doi: 10.1038/srep03643.,,,,"['MC_UU_12009/17/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/J000612/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,['PDB/4KFZ'],,,,,,

Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) activation by means of oxaloacetate administration has been used to reduce the glutamate concentration in the blood. However, the protective effect of the administration of the recombinant GOT1 (rGOT1) enzyme has not been yet addressed in cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to analyze the protective effect of an effective dose of oxaloacetate and the human rGOT1 alone and in combination with a non-effective dose of oxaloacetate in an animal model of ischemic stroke. Sixty rats were subjected to a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Infarct volumes were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before treatment administration, and 24 h and 7 days after MCAO. Brain glutamate levels were determined by in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) during artery occlusion (80 min) and reperfusion (180 min). GOT activity and serum glutamate concentration were analyzed during the occlusion and reperfusion period. Somatosensory test was performed at baseline and 7 days after MCAO. The three treatments tested induced a reduction in serum and brain glutamate levels, resulting in a reduction in infarct volume and sensorimotor deficit. Protective effect of rGOT1 supplemented with oxaloacetate at 7 days persists even when treatment was delayed until at least 2 h after onset of ischemia. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination of human rGOT1 with low doses of oxaloacetate seems to be a successful approach for stroke treatment.","['Perez-Mato, M', 'Ramos-Cabrer, P', 'Sobrino, T', 'Blanco, M', 'Ruban, A', 'Mirelman, D', 'Menendez, P', 'Castillo, J', 'Campos, F']","['Perez-Mato M', 'Ramos-Cabrer P', 'Sobrino T', 'Blanco M', 'Ruban A', 'Mirelman D', 'Menendez P', 'Castillo J', 'Campos F']","['Department of Neurology, Neurovascular Area, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, Neurovascular Area, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, Neurovascular Area, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, Neurovascular Area, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Neurobiology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', '1] Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program of the University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain [2] Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, Neurovascular Area, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, Neurovascular Area, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Protective Agents)', '2F399MM81J (Oxaloacetic Acid)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (Aspartate Aminotransferase, Cytoplasmic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspartate Aminotransferase, Cytoplasmic/*administration & dosage/blood/genetics', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/drug effects', 'Brain Ischemia/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxaloacetic Acid/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Protective Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Radiography', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",PMC4040715,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013507 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.507 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jan 9;5:e992. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.507.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24407241,NLM,MEDLINE,20140902,20211021,2041-4889 (Electronic),5,,2014 Jan 9,PSTPIP2 dysregulation contributes to aberrant terminal differentiation in GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes by activating LYN.,e988,10.1038/cddis.2013.512 [doi],"GATA1 mutations are tightly associated with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute megakaryoblstic leukemia (AMKL) in children with Down syndrome. Numerous genes are altered in GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes, which may contribute to the hyperproliferation and abnormal terminal differentiation of these malignant cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Pstpip2 is a GATA-1-repressed gene that controls megakaryopoiesis. Ectopic expression of PSTPIP2 impaired megakaryocytic differentiation as evidenced by a decrease of CD41 expression and reduced DNA content in K562 cells. PSTPIP2 overexpression also caused enhanced activation of Src family kinases and subsequently reduced ERK phosphorylation. Consistently, PSTPIP2 knockdown showed the opposite effect on differentiation and signaling. Moreover, the W232A mutant of PSTPIP2, defective in its interaction with PEST family phosphatases that recruit c-Src terminal kinase (CSK) to suppress Src family kinases, failed to inhibit differentiation and lost its ability to enhance Src family kinases or reduce ERK phosphorylation. In fact, the W232A mutant of PSTPIP2 promoted megakaryocyte differentiation. These observations suggest that PSTPIP2 recruiting PEST phosphatases somehow blocked CSK activity and led to enhanced activation of Src family kinases and reduced ERK phosphorylation, which ultimately repressed megakaryocyte differentiation. Supporting this idea, PSTPIP2 interacted with LYN and the expression of a dominant negative LYN (LYN DN) overwhelmed the inhibitory effect of PSTPIP2 on differentiation and ERK signaling. In addition, a constitutively active LYN (LYN CA) normalized the enhanced megakaryocyte differentiation and repressed ERK signaling in PSTPIP2 knockdown cells. Finally, we found that PSTPIP2 repressed ERK signaling, differentiation, and proliferation and verified that PSTPIP2 upregulation repressed megakaryocyte development in primary mouse bone marrow cells. Our study thus reveals a novel mechanism by which dysregulation of PSTPIP2 due to GATA-1 deficiency may contribute to abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation in pathogenesis of related diseases.","['Liu, L', 'Wen, Q', 'Gong, R', 'Gilles, L', 'Stankiewicz, M J', 'Li, W', 'Guo, M', 'Li, L', 'Sun, X', 'Li, W', 'Crispino, J D', 'Huang, Z']","['Liu L', 'Wen Q', 'Gong R', 'Gilles L', 'Stankiewicz MJ', 'Li W', 'Guo M', 'Li L', 'Sun X', 'Li W', 'Crispino JD', 'Huang Z']","['College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Hubei International Travel Healthcare Center, Hubei Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of P.

It also seems to be involved in the development of glucose metabolism disturbances. The goal of the study was the determination of VF concentrations in children with leukemia who are treated with stem cell transplantation. VF concentrations were measured in plasma before and after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 60 and 120 minutes) in 22 children with leukemia treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and healthy control subjects (n = 24). The HSCT group was studied twice: before HSCT (22 children) and approximately 6 months after HSCT (12 of 22 children). After fasting, concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were determined. Significantly lower (p < 0.05) median values of VF concentrations at all time points in the OGTT were found in pre- HSCT children compared with control subjects. The median VF concentration was significantly higher after HSCT compared with before HSCT. The decrease in VF in leukemic children in complete remission may be caused by myelosuppression and immunosuppression after prolong chemotherapy and is beneficial because of the decrease in its antiapoptotic activity. VF can serve as an additional biochemical marker for remission in patients with leukemia. Normalization of plasma VF concentration after HSCT might be caused by a process of immune reconstitution and prolonged inflammation (e.g., infections, graft-versus-host disease), injury to organs (e.g., lungs, gut, liver), and endocrinology deficiencies.","['Skoczen, Szymon', 'Tomasik, Przemyslaw J', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Fijorek, Kamil', 'Krasowska-Kwiecien, Aleksandra', 'Wiecha, Oktawiusz', 'Czogala, Wojciech', 'Dluzniewska, Agnieszka', 'Sztefko, Krystyna', 'Starzyk, Jerzy', 'Siedlar, Maciej']","['Skoczen S', 'Tomasik PJ', 'Gozdzik J', 'Fijorek K', 'Krasowska-Kwiecien A', 'Wiecha O', 'Czogala W', 'Dluzniewska A', 'Sztefko K', 'Starzyk J', 'Siedlar M']","[""Department of Immunology, Chair of Clinical Immunology and Transplantation, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland; Transplantation Centre, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland.

In most patients, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib induces complete remission. For patients who are intolerant or resistant, novel TKIs have been proposed. We examined the in vitro effects of 14 kinase blockers on growth and function of EOL-1 cells, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA(+) eosinophil cell line. Major growth-inhibitory effects were seen with all PDGFR-blocking agents, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range: ponatinib, 0.1-0.2 nmol/L; sorafenib, 0.1-0.2 nmol/L; masitinib, 0.2-0.5 nmol/L; nilotinib, 0.2-1.0 nmol/L; dasatinib, 0.5-2.0 nmol/L; sunitinib, 1-2 nmol/L; midostaurin, 5-10 nmol/L. These drugs were also found to block activation of PDGFR-downstream signaling molecules, including Akt, S6, and STAT5 in EOL-1 cells. All effective TKIs produced apoptosis in EOL-1 cells as determined by microscopy, Annexin-V/PI, and caspase-3 staining. In addition, PDGFR-targeting TKIs were found to inhibit cytokine-induced migration of EOL-1 cells. In all bioassays used, ponatinib was found to be the most potent compound in EOL-1 cells. In addition, ponatinib was found to downregulate expression of the activation-linked surface antigen CD63 on EOL-1 cells and to suppress the growth of primary neoplastic eosinophils. We also examined drug effects on Ba/F3 cells expressing two clinically relevant, imatinib-resistant, mutant forms of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, namely T674I and D842V. Strong inhibitory effects on both mutants were seen only with ponatinib.

Using SSAW, our microfluidic cytometer was able to continuously focus microparticles/cells at the pressure node inside a microchannel. Flow cytometry was successfully demonstrated using this system with a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 10% at a throughput of ~1000 events s(-1) when calibration beads were used. We also demonstrated that fluorescently labeled human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) could be effectively focused and detected with our SSAW-based system. This SSAW-based microfluidic cytometer did not require any sheath flows or complex structures, and it allowed for simple operation over a wide range of sample flow rates.

The pathophysiology of PH in MF is unknown and no definitive therapies have been established. We studied 15 patients with MF-associated PH and compared their echocardiographic and PH relevant biomarkers (nitric oxide (NO), N-terminal pro-hormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP), von Willebrand antigen (vWB), ristocetin-cofactor activity (RCA) and uric acid (UA)) pre- and post-ruxolitinib treatment. Ruxolitinib decreased the plasma levels of NT-pro BNP (73%; P=0.043), UA (60%), vWB (86%) and RCA (73%; P=0.036). Improvements in echocardiographic findings were also seen in 66% of patients (P=0.022). Furthermore, marked increase in NO compared with baseline (69.75 vs 40.1 picomolar (pM); P=0.001) was observed post-ruxolitinib therapy, whereas no changes were noted with conventional therapies. Treatment with ruxolitinib also resulted in the reduction of key cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6 and IL-8) and induction of interferon-gamma. Animal studies further supported the role of ruxolitinib in the induction of NO levels. In conclusion, aberrant Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling in MF may mediate PH through dysregulation of NO and cytokine levels, which can be restored by therapy with JAK inhibitors suggesting that inhibition of this pathway is a novel target for the management of patients with PH.","['Tabarroki, A', 'Lindner, D J', 'Visconte, V', 'Zhang, L', 'Rogers, H J', 'Parker, Y', 'Duong, H K', 'Lichtin, A', 'Kalaycio, M E', 'Sekeres, M A', 'Mountantonakis, S E', 'Heresi, G A', 'Tiu, R V']","['Tabarroki A', 'Lindner DJ', 'Visconte V', 'Zhang L', 'Rogers HJ', 'Parker Y', 'Duong HK', 'Lichtin A', 'Kalaycio ME', 'Sekeres MA', 'Mountantonakis SE', 'Heresi GA', 'Tiu RV']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', '1] Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA [2] Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', '1] Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA [2] Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140110,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide/blood', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/*complications/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines']",,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20145 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1486-93. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.5.

The guanosine 5'-O-[3-thio]triphosphate (GTPgammaS), a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP (guanosine 5'-triphosphate), is an effective secretagogue for different cell types of different species, like mast cells, neutrophils or eosinophils. Consequently, the internal administration of GTPgammaS causes degranulation of mouse and rat mast cells. Regarding rat mast cells, it is proved that Ca(2+) can cooperate with GTP or GTPgammaS in accelerating and increasing amplitude of the secretory response. All the previous studies with respect to capacitance recordings and mast cells were performed using mouse or rat mast cells, usually derived from peritoneum or the rat basophilic leukaemia cell line RBL. In this study, we applied the capacitance measurement technique to the human mast cell line-1 (HMC-1) cells, an immature cell line established from a patient with mast cell leukaemia. Patch-clamp dialysis experiments revealed that high intracellular free Ca(2+) and GTPgammaS concentrations are both required for considerable capacitance increases in HMC-1 cells. During degranulation of HMC-1 cells, the total membrane capacitance (Cm) increase appeared continuously and, in some cases, as a discrete capacitance change, developing in a stepwise manner. Then, we tested the effect of latrunculin B upon HMC-1 cell capacitance increase as well as of some classic mast cell stimulators like PMA, A23187 and IL-1beta in hexosaminidase release. Finally, we could conclude that the HMC-1 cell line represents a suitable model for the study of human mast cell degranulation.","['Balletta, Andrea', 'Lorenz, Dorothea', 'Rummel, Andreas', 'Gerhard, Ralf', 'Bigalke, Hans', 'Wegner, Florian']","['Balletta A', 'Lorenz D', 'Rummel A', 'Gerhard R', 'Bigalke H', 'Wegner F']","['Department of Toxicology, Hannover Medical School, Carl Neuberg Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany; Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl Neuberg Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.

Although glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is known to be required for spontaneous cell death in neutrophils, the requirement of GSK-3beta activation for the apoptotic effects remains unknown. This question is addressed in the present study using a model of ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation and apoptosis in APL HL60 cells. ATRA at a therapeutic concentration (1 muM) induced granulocytic differentiation, followed by apoptosis. ATRA treatment caused decreased Mcl-1, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage following the inactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and the activation of GSK-3beta. Pharmacologically and genetically inhibiting GSK-3beta effectively retarded ATRA-induced Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis. Additional differentiation inducers, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and dimethyl sulfoxide, also triggered GSK-3beta-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, ATRA caused the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through increased expression of NADPH oxidase subunits (p47(phox) and p67(phox)) to facilitate ATRA-induced GSK-3beta activation and cell apoptosis. This study indicates that ROS initiate GSK-3beta-dependent apoptosis in granulocyte-differentiated cells after long-term ATRA treatment.","['Wang, Chi-Yun', 'Yang, Tsan-Tzu', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Lin, Wei-Chieh', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Wang CY', 'Yang TT', 'Chen CL', 'Lin WC', 'Lin CF']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; Center of Infectious Disease and Signaling Research, National Cheng Kung University, 1, University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.

A panel of experts in CML management were invited for a 2-day workshop. Prior to the conference, the organizing committee selected several topics and assigned them to different physicians divided in four groups. Issues discussed were (1) role of cytogenetic and molecular response monitoring in 2013; (2) frontline treatment of CML in 2013 and therapeutic objectives; (3) how to monitor response and when to change therapy after resistance or non-optimal responses; (4) possible therapy discontinuation after achievement of deep and stable molecular responses. Different national experts reviewed the literature, analyzed levels of evidence for each topic and, after extensive discussions within smaller working groups, presented their conclusions during the meeting. Each consensus aim was then evaluated by a general vote in the plenary sessions.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G', 'Baccarani M', 'Bocchia M', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Gozzini A', 'Morra E', 'Pane F', 'Pregno P', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Rosti G', 'Specchia G', 'Vigneri P', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Biotechnologies and Cellular Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.

In order to improve survival rates in AML patients, new strategies are necessary to discover biomarkers for the detection and targeted therapy of AML. One of the advantages of the aptamer-based technology is the unique cell-based selection process, which allows us to efficiently select for cell-specific aptamers without knowing which target molecules are present on the cell surface. METHODS: The NB4 AML cell line was used as the target cell population for selecting single stranded DNA aptamers. After determining the affinity of selected aptamers to leukocytes, the aptamers were used to phenotype human bone marrow leukocytes and AML cells in clinical specimens. Then a biotin-labelled aptamer was used to enrich and identify its target surface protein. RESULTS: Three new aptamers were characterized from the selected aptamer pools (JH6, JH19, and K19). All of them can selectively recognize myeloid cells with Kd in the low nanomole range (2.77 to 12.37 nM). The target of the biotin-labelled K19 aptamer probe was identified as Siglec-5, a surface membrane protein in low abundance whose expression can serve as a biomarker of granulocytic maturation and be used to phenotype AML. More importantly, Siglec-5 expression can be used to detect low concentrations of AML cells in human bone marrow specimens, and functions as a potential target for leukemic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a pipeline approach for developing single stranded DNA aptamer probes, phenotyping AML cells in clinical specimens, and then identifying the aptamer-recognized target protein. The developed aptamer probes and identified Siglec-5 protein may potentially be used for leukemic cell detection and therapy in our future clinical practice.","['Yang, Mingli', 'Jiang, Guohua', 'Li, Wenjing', 'Qiu, Kai', 'Zhang, Min', 'Carter, Christopher M', 'Al-Quran, Samer Z', 'Li, Ying']","['Yang M', 'Jiang G', 'Li W', 'Qiu K', 'Zhang M', 'Carter CM', 'Al-Quran SZ', 'Li Y']","['UF/Shands Medical Laboratory at Rocky Point, 4800 35th Drive, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA. liying@pathology.ufl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140109,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SIGLEC5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/metabolism', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lectins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'SELEX Aptamer Technique/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC3895837,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-5 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jan 9;7:5. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-5.,,,,"['R01 CA129311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An ideal therapy should address all aspects of this multifactorial disease. Ixmyelocel-T therapy, an expanded autologous multicellular therapy showing clinical promise in the treatment of diseases associated with advanced atherosclerosis, includes a novel population of M2-like macrophages. Here, we examine the macrophages of ixmyelocel-T and determine their ability to influx modified cholesterol in an atheroprotective manner, maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and preventing cellular dysfunction and death, ultimately promoting reverse cholesterol efflux. METHODS: Approximately 50 ml of whole bone marrow was obtained from healthy donors and shipped overnight. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were produced by using density gradient separation and cultured for approximately 12 days to generate ixmyelocel-T. CD14+ cells were isolated from ixmyelocel-T via positive selection for analysis. Ixmyelocel-T and human leukemia monocyte (THP-1) cells were loaded with acetylated low-density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) for analysis. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to examine Ac-LDL uptake, expression of cytokines was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assay (ELISA), and quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze expression of cholesterol-transport genes. Both the in vitro cholesterol efflux assay and in vivo reverse cholesterol transport assay were used to examine cholesterol transport. RESULTS: Ixmyelocel-T macrophages take up acetylated low-density lipoprotein and express the scavenger receptors CD36 and scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-B1). Ixmyelocel-T did not become apoptotic or proinflammatory after lipid loading. The cholesterol transporter genes ABAC1 and ABCG1 were both statistically significantly upregulated when ixmyelocel-T macrophages were loaded with cholesterol. Ixmyelocel-T also exhibited enhanced apolipoprotein A-I (ApoAI)-mediated cholesterol efflux. In addition, in vivo reverse cholesterol-transport assay demonstrated that ixmyelocel-T was able to efflux cholesterol in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Ixmyelocel-T macrophages influx modified cholesterol, remained anti-inflammatory in the face of lipid loading and inflammatory challenge, and displayed enhanced cholesterol efflux capabilities. These combined features suggest that this autologous multicellular therapy may exert beneficial effects in atherosclerotic diseases.","['Ledford, Kelly J', 'Murphy, Nikki', 'Zeigler, Frank', 'Bartel, Ronnda L']","['Ledford KJ', 'Murphy N', 'Zeigler F', 'Bartel RL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131101,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (ABCG1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (SCARB1 protein, human)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)', '0 (acetyl-LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Apolipoprotein A-I/metabolism', 'Atherosclerosis/metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD36 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/toxicity', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B/metabolism']",PMC4029553,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['scrt346 [pii]', '10.1186/scrt346 [doi]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2013 Nov 1;4(6):135. doi: 10.1186/scrt346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene is associated with numerous alternatively spliced transcripts, which initiate from two different unique first exons within the WT1 and the alternative (A)WT1 promoter intervals. Within the hematological system, WT1 expression is restricted to CD34+/CD38- cells and is undetectable after differentiation. Detectable expression of this gene is an excellent marker for minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the underlying epigenetic alterations are unknown. METHODS: To determine the changes in the underlying epigenetic landscape responsible for this expression, we characterized expression, DNA methylation and histone modification profiles in 28 hematological cancer cell lines and confirmed the methylation signature in 356 cytogenetically well-characterized primary hematological malignancies. RESULTS: Despite high expression of WT1 and AWT1 transcripts in AML-derived cell lines, we observe robust hypermethylation of the AWT1 promoter and an epigenetic switch from a permissive to repressive chromatin structure between normal cells and AML cell lines. Subsequent methylation analysis in our primary leukemia and lymphoma cohort revealed that the epigenetic signature identified in cell lines is specific to myeloid-lineage malignancies, irrespective of underlying mutational status or translocation. In addition to being a highly specific marker for AML diagnosis (positive predictive value 100%; sensitivity 86.1%; negative predictive value 89.4%), we show that AWT1 hypermethylation also discriminates patients that relapse from those achieving complete remission after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with similar efficiency to WT1 expression profiling. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a methylation signature of the AWT1 promoter CpG island that is a promising marker for classifying myeloid-derived leukemias. In addition AWT1 hypermethylation is ideally suited to monitor the recurrence of disease during remission in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transfer.","['Guillaumet-Adkins, Amy', 'Richter, Julia', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Sandoval, Juan', 'Agirre, Xabi', 'Catala, Albert', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Buno, Ismael', 'Kwon, Mi', 'Court, Franck', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Monk, David']","['Guillaumet-Adkins A', 'Richter J', 'Odero MD', 'Sandoval J', 'Agirre X', 'Catala A', 'Esteller M', 'Prosper F', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Buno I', 'Kwon M', 'Court F', 'Siebert R', 'Monk D']","[""Imprinting and Cancer group, Cancer Epigenetic and Biology Program, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Av, Gran Via de L'Hospotalet 199-203, 08907 L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain. dmonk@idibell.cat.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3900738,2014/01/11 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/01/11 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jan 9;7:4. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study is to elucidate the effects of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal pathways underlying the biologic activity of SCL/TAL1 on normal hematopoietic development. Lentiviral vectors with up or down-regulation of SCL/TAL1 were transfected into umbilical cord blood CD34 stem cells. EGFR signaling pathways (including MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR) and surface hematopoietic markers were analyzed in the process of hematopoietic differentiation. The data revealed that up or down-regulation of SCL/TAL1 gene was accompanied positively by the expressions of p-MEK and p-ERK1/2 protein, but the changes of Akt/mTOR were unobvious. MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 and SCL/TAL1 down-regulation showed similar inhibitory effects on erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryoid differentiation. However, Akt/mTOR pathway altered insignificantly. MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 could not affect the expression of SCL/TAL1 mRNA or protein. Taken together, these findings fully illustrated that SCL/TAL1 is located in the up-stream of MEK/ERK pathway and partially regulates hematopoiesis by modulating the phosphorylation level of the key proteins in MEK/ERK pathway.","['Zhou, Rui Qing', 'Wu, Jia Hui', 'Gong, Yu Ping', 'Guo, Yong', 'Xing, Hong Yun']","['Zhou RQ', 'Wu JH', 'Gong YP', 'Guo Y', 'Xing HY']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

The structural basis of the interaction between MDM2 (the p53 receptor) and YH239 is elucidated by a co-crystal structure.

In total, there were 50 participants (n=26 male, n=24 female), which represented the following major hematological diagnostic groups: multiple myeloma (n=15), lymphoma (n=14), leukemia (n=17), and other (n=4). Of the overall cohort, 11 participants had undergone a bone marrow transplant, and 15 had undergone a stem cell transplant (allogeneic and autologous transplants). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Most participants believed that a ""Patient Stories"" DVD would be a beneficial and effective way for nurses delivering psychosocial support to hematology patients. Such benefits included a sense of normalization from hearing similar stories and providing convenient support that did not require travel or potentially uncomfortable social situations.

Here, we compare the efficiency of genetically modified NK-92 cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) at killing NK cell-resistant B-lymphoid leukemia cells to the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK-92 cells expressing a high affinity variant of the IgG Fc receptor (FcgammaRIII). First, we compared in vitro the abilities of NK-92 cells expressing CD20-targeting CARs to kill primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells derived from 9 patients with active, untreated disease to the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells expressing FcgammaRIII combined with either of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) rituximab or ofatumumab. We found that CAR-expressing NK-92 cells effectively kill NK cell-resistant primary CLL cells and that such a cytotoxic response is significantly stronger than that resulting from ADCC. For studying CAR-expressing NK cell-based immunotherapy in vivo, we established xenograft mouse models of residual leukemia using the human BCR-ABL1(+) cell lines SUP-B15 (CD19(+)CD20(-)) and TMD-5 (CD19(+)CD20(+)), two acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lines that are resistant to parental NK-92 cells. Intravenous injection of NK-92 cells expressing CD19-targeting CARs eliminated SUP-B15 cells, whereas they had no such effect on TMD-5 cells. However, the intrafemoral injection of NK-92 cells expressing CD19-targeting CAR resulted in the depletion of TMD-5 cells from the bone marrow environment. Comparative studies in which NK-92 cells expressing either CD19- or CD20-targeting CARs were directly injected into subcutaneous CD19(+)CD20(+) Daudi lymphoma xenografts revealed that CD20-targeting CAR is superior to its CD19-specific counterpart in controlling local tumor growth. In summary, we show here that CAR-expressing NK-92 cells can be functionally superior to ADCC (as mediated by anti-CD20 mAbs) in the elimination of primary CLL cells.

Here we report establishment of a new leukemia cell line, PVTL-1, homozygous for JAK2-V617F from a 73-year-old female patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from MPN. PVTL-1 is positive for CD7, CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117, HLA-DR, and MPO, and has complex karyotypic abnormalities, 44,XX,-5q,-7,-8,add(11)(p11.2),add(11)(q23),-16,+21,-22,+mar1. Sequence analysis of JAK2 revealed only the mutated allele coding for Jak2-V617F. Proliferation of PVTL-1 was inhibited and apoptosis was induced by the pan-Jak inhibitor Jak inhibitor-1 (JakI-1) or dasatinib, which inhibits the Src family kinases as well as BCR/ABL. Consistently, the Src family kinase Lyn was constitutively activated with phosphorylation of Y396 in the activation loop, which was inhibited by dasatinib but not by JakI-1. Further analyses with JakI-1 and dasatinib indicated that Jak2-V617F phosphorylated STAT5 and SHP2 while Lyn phosphorylated SHP1, SHP2, Gab-2, c-Cbl, and CrkL to induce the SHP2/Gab2 and c-Cbl/CrkL complex formation. In addition, JakI-1 and dasatinib inactivated the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathway and reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 in PVTL-1 cells, which correlated with their effects on proliferation and survival of these cells. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3 by its inhibitor SB216763 mitigated apoptosis induced by dasatinib but not by JakI-1. Together, these data suggest that apoptosis may be suppressed in PVTL-1 cells through inactivation of GSK3 by Lyn as well as Jak2-V617F and additionally through activation of STAT5 by Jak2-V617F. It is also speculated that activation of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathway may mediate proliferation signaling from Jak2-V617F and Lyn. PVTL-1 cells may provide a valuable model system to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in evolution of Jak2-V617F-expressing MPN to AML and to develop novel therapies against this intractable condition.","['Nagao, Toshikage', 'Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Umezawa, Yoshihiro', 'Nogami, Ayako', 'Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Tohda, Shuji', 'Yamamoto, Masahide', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Nagao T', 'Kurosu T', 'Umezawa Y', 'Nogami A', 'Oshikawa G', 'Tohda S', 'Yamamoto M', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3880321,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084746 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-34652 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 3;9(1):e84746. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084746. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Memory phenotype PD-1+ CD4+ T cells accumulate with age and during leukemic development, and they might account for the attenuated T cell response in elderly or diseased individuals. The transcription factor C/EBPalpha has been suggested to be responsible for the accumulation as well as for the senescent features of these cells including impaired TCR signaling and decreased proliferation. Thus modulating the activity of C/EBPalpha could potentially target PD-1+ CD4+ T cells and consequently, impede the development of immunosenescence. To exploit this possibility we tested the importance of C/EBPalpha for the development of age-dependent PD-1+ CD4+ T cells as well as its role in the accumulation of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells during leukemic progression. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we find that loss of C/EBPalpha expression in the lymphoid compartment led to an increase of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells specifically in old mice, suggesting that C/EBPalpha repress the accumulation of these cells in elderly by inhibiting their proliferation. Furthermore, C/EBPalpha-deficiency in the lymphoid compartment had no effect on leukemic development and did not affect the accumulation of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells. Thus, in addition to contradict earlier suggestions of a role for C/EBPalpha in immunosenescence, these findings efficiently discard the potential of using C/EBPalpha as a target for the alleviation of ageing/cancer-associated immunosenescence.","['Norrie, Ida Christine', 'Ohlsson, Ewa', 'Nielsen, Olaf', 'Hasemann, Marie Sigurd', 'Porse, Bo T']","['Norrie IC', 'Ohlsson E', 'Nielsen O', 'Hasemann MS', 'Porse BT']","['Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Institute of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark ; Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*metabolism', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism']",PMC3880335,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084728 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-34098 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 3;9(1):e84728. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084728. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) is important for excretion of MTX and its toxic metabolite. The ABCC2 -24C>T polymorphism (rs717620) reportedly contributes to variability of MTX kinetics. In the present study, we assessed the association between the ABCC2 -24C>T polymorphism and methotrexate (MTX) toxicities in childhood ALL patients treated with high-dose MTX. A total of 112 Han Chinese ALL patients were treated with high-dose MTX according to the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster 2000 protocol. Our results showed that presence of the -24T allele in ABCC2 gene led to significantly higher MTX plasma concentrations at 48 hours after the start of infusion, which would strengthen over repeated MTX infusion. The -24T allele in ABCC2 gene was significantly associated with higher risks of high-grade hematologic (leucopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) and non-hematologic (gastrointestinal and mucosal damage/oral mucositis) MTX toxicities. This study provides the first evidence that the -24T allele in ABCC2 gene is associated with the severity of MTX toxicities, which add fresh insights into clinical application of high-dose MTX and individualization of MTX treatment.","['Liu, Yan', 'Yin, You', 'Sheng, Qi', 'Lu, Xiaotong', 'Wang, Fang', 'Lin, Zhiyan', 'Tian, Huaiping', 'Xu, Ajing', 'Zhang, Jian']","['Liu Y', 'Yin Y', 'Sheng Q', 'Lu X', 'Wang F', 'Lin Z', 'Tian H', 'Xu A', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/radiation effects', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",PMC3880259,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0082681 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-18734 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 3;9(1):e82681. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082681. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(3):e91384'],,,,,

To investigate the potential applicability of DEP to different cancer types, the dielectric and density properties of the NCI-60 panel of tumor cell types have been measured by dielectrophoretic field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF) and compared with like properties of the subpopulations of normal peripheral blood cells. We show that all of the NCI-60 cell types, regardless of tissue of origin, exhibit dielectric properties that facilitate their isolation from blood by DEP. Cell types derived from solid tumors that grew in adherent cultures exhibited dielectric properties that were strikingly different from those of peripheral blood cell subpopulations while leukemia-derived lines that grew in non-adherent cultures exhibited dielectric properties that were closer to those of peripheral blood cell types.

However, Nef is dispensable for the production of HIV-1 virions of optimal infectivity if the producer cells are superinfected with certain gammaretroviruses. In the case of the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV), the Nef-like effect is mediated by the glycosylated Gag (glycoGag) protein. We now show that the N-terminal intracellular domain of the type II transmembrane protein glycoGag is responsible for its effect on HIV-1 infectivity. In the context of a fully active minimal M-MLV glycoGag construct, truncations of the cytoplasmic domain led to a near total loss of activity. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of M-MLV glycoGag was fully sufficient to transfer the activity to an unrelated type II transmembrane protein. Although the intracellular region of glycoGag is relatively poorly conserved even among ecotropic and xenotropic MLVs, it was also fully sufficient for the rescue of nef-deficient HIV-1 when derived from a xenotropic virus. A mutagenic analysis showed that only a core region of the intracellular domain that exhibits at least some conservation between murine and feline leukemia viruses is crucial for activity. In particular, a conserved YXXL motif in the center of this core region was critical. In addition, expression of the mu2 subunit of the AP-2 adaptor complex in virus producer cells was essential for activity. We conclude that the ability to enhance HIV-1 infectivity is a conserved property of the MLV glycoGag cytoplasmic domain and involves AP-2-mediated endocytosis. IMPORTANCE: The Nef protein of HIV-1 and the entirely unrelated glycosylated Gag (glycoGag) protein of a murine leukemia virus (MLV) similarly enhance the infectiousness of HIV-1 particles by an unknown mechanism. MLV glycoGag is an alternative version of the structural viral Gag protein with an extra upstream region that provides a cytosolic domain and a plasma membrane anchor. We now show for the first time that the cytosolic domain of MLV glycoGag contains all the information needed to enhance HIV-1 infectivity and that this function of the cytosolic domain is conserved despite limited sequence conservation. Within the cytosolic domain, a motif that resembles a cellular sorting signal is critical for activity. Furthermore, the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity depends on an endocytic cellular protein that is known to interact with such sorting signals. Together, our findings implicate the endocytic machinery in the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity by MLV glycoGag.","['Usami, Yoshiko', 'Popov, Sergei', 'Gottlinger, Heinrich G']","['Usami Y', 'Popov S', 'Gottlinger HG']","['Program in Gene Function and Expression, Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140108,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex mu Subunits)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (adaptor protein complex 2, mu 2 subunit)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex mu Subunits/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, nef/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'HIV Infections/genetics/*metabolism/*virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/deficiency/genetics']",PMC3957955,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01933-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01933-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Mar;88(6):3443-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01933-13.

The results revealed distinct patterns of microRNA expression in HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T-cell lines with respect to their normal counterparts. In addition, a search for virus-encoded microRNAs yielded 2 sequences that originated from the plus strand of the HTLV-1 genome. Several sequences derived from tRNAs were expressed at substantial levels in both uninfected and infected cells. One of the most abundant tRNA fragments (tRF-3019) was derived from the 3' end of tRNA-proline. tRF-3019 exhibited perfect sequence complementarity to the primer binding site of HTLV-1. The results of an in vitro reverse transcriptase assay verified that tRF-3019 was capable of priming HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase. Both tRNA-proline and tRF-3019 were detected in virus particles isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells. These findings suggest that tRF-3019 may play an important role in priming HTLV-1 reverse transcription and could thus represent a novel target to control HTLV-1 infection. IMPORTANCE: Small noncoding RNAs, a growing family of regulatory RNAs that includes microRNAs and tRNA fragments, have recently emerged as key players in many biological processes, including viral infection and cancer. In the present study, we employed mass sequencing to identify the repertoire of small noncoding RNAs in normal T cells compared to T cells transformed with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), a retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The results revealed a distinct pattern of microRNA expression in HTLV-1-infected cells and a tRNA fragment (tRF-3019) that was packaged into virions and capable of priming HTLV-1 reverse transcription, a key event in the retroviral life cycle. These findings indicate tRF-3019 could represent a novel target for therapies aimed at controlling HTLV-1 infection.","['Ruggero, Katia', 'Guffanti, Alessandro', 'Corradin, Alberto', 'Sharma, Varun Kumar', 'De Bellis, Gianluca', 'Corti, Giorgio', 'Grassi, Angela', 'Zanovello, Paola', 'Bronte, Vincenzo', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', ""D'Agostino, Donna M""]","['Ruggero K', 'Guffanti A', 'Corradin A', 'Sharma VK', 'De Bellis G', 'Corti G', 'Grassi A', 'Zanovello P', 'Bronte V', 'Ciminale V', ""D'Agostino DM""]","['Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140108,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Small Untranslated)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Small Untranslated/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Reverse Transcription']",PMC3993537,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02823-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02823-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Apr;88(7):3612-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02823-13.

Here, we show that the BRD4 bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 is highly active against the p53-wild-type Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI)-AML3 cell line which carries mutations in nucleophosmin (NPM1) and DNA methyltransferase 3 (DNMT3A) genes commonly associated with poor prognostic disease. We find that JQ1 causes caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis and DNA damage response in these cells. In combination studies, we show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, the HDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3, and the anthracycline daunorubicin all enhance the apoptotic response of JQ1. These compounds all induce activation of p53 suggesting that JQ1 might sensitize AML cells to p53-mediated cell death. In further experiments, we show that BRD4 associates with acetylated p53 but that this association is not inhibited by JQ1 indicating that the protein-protein interaction does not involve bromodomain binding of acetylated lysines. Instead, we propose that JQ1 acts to prevent BRD4-mediated recruitment of p53 to chromatin targets following its activation in OCI-AML3 cells resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a c-MYC-independent manner. Our data suggest that BET bromodomain inhibition might enhance current chemotherapy strategies in AML, notably in poor-risk DNMT3A/NPM1-mutated disease.","['Stewart, Helen Jayne Susan', 'Horne, Gillian Abigail', 'Bastow, Sarah', 'Chevassut, Timothy James Telfer']","['Stewart HJ', 'Horne GA', 'Bastow S', 'Chevassut TJ']","['Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, East Sussex, BN1 9PS, U.K; Department of Haematology, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, East Sussex, BN2 5BE, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131031,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3892387,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.146 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2013 Dec;2(6):826-35. doi: 10.1002/cam4.146.

This study is devoted to compare the occurrences and rank correlations of SPCs between Germany and Sweden. Patients diagnosed with 10 common first primaries between 1997 and 2006 from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database and 10 German cancer registries were included in this population-based study. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the strength of the relationship of SPCs between the German and Swedish datasets. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients suggested a strong positive correlation between the German and Swedish datasets based on the ranks of thirty possible SPCs after all selected first cancers. This was also true when we compared the rankings and proportions of the five most common SPCs after site-specific first primaries between the two populations. For kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and leukemia the components of the five most common SPCs was exactly the same. Also, the ranking and the proportions for the three most common SPCs (i.e., colorectal, bladder, and lung cancers) after prostate cancer were identical in the two populations, as were those after most other primary cancers. The strikingly consistent patterns of SPCs in the two populations provide excellent opportunities for joint studies and they also suggest that many underlying reasons for SPC may have universal and tangible causes that await mechanistic dissection.","['Liu, Hao', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Holleczek, Bernd', 'Katalinic, Alexander', 'Emrich, Katharina', 'Jansen, Lina', 'Brenner, Hermann']","['Liu H', 'Hemminki K', 'Sundquist J', 'Holleczek B', 'Katalinic A', 'Emrich K', 'Jansen L', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130827,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC3892803,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.116 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2013 Oct;2(5):718-24. doi: 10.1002/cam4.116.

These CSF3R mutations fall into two distinct categories: membrane-proximal mutations and truncation mutations. Although both classes of mutation have exhibited the capacity for cellular transformation, several aspects of this transformation, including the kinetics, the requirement for ligand, and the dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways, have all been shown to be discrepant between the mutation types, suggesting distinct mechanisms of activation. CSF3R truncation mutations induce overexpression and ligand hypersensitivity of the receptor, likely because of the removal of motifs necessary for endocytosis and degradation. In contrast, little is known about the mechanism of activation of membrane-proximal mutations, which are much more commonly observed in chronic neutrophilic leukemia. In contrast with CSF3R truncation mutations, membrane-proximal mutations do not exhibit overexpression and are capable of signaling in the absence of ligand. We show that the Thr-615 and Thr-618 sites of membrane-proximal mutations are part of an O-linked glycosylation cluster. Mutation at these sites prevents O-glycosylation of CSF3R and increases receptor dimerization. This increased dimerization explains the ligand-independent activation of CSF3R membrane-proximal mutations.

However, there are little clinical data on cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in patients with immunosuppression due to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this study we evaluated the clinical features, patterns of recurrence, and outcomes of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A review was performed of 42 consecutive patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia presenting to our institution between July 2000 and July 2010. Baseline characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients presented with primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (33 node negative, 1 node positive), and eight patients presented with nodal disease without a simultaneous index primary. The 2-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence for primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was 15%. Nodal recurrence occurred in 36% of node-negative patients. The 3-year overall and cause-specific survival rate for all patients was 37% and 65%, respectively. In patients managed curatively for nodal disease at presentation or relapse (n = 17), the 3-year overall and cause-specific survival rate was 21% and 53%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia experience higher rates of skin cancer recurrence and death than expected in an immunocompetent population. Novel strategies are needed to improve outcomes.","['Tomaszewski, Jonathan M', 'Gavriel, Haim', 'Link, Emma', 'Boodhun, Sholeh', 'Sizeland, Andrew', 'Corry, June']","['Tomaszewski JM', 'Gavriel H', 'Link E', 'Boodhun S', 'Sizeland A', 'Corry J']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140210,United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*immunology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology']",,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/10/21 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/lary.24586 [doi]'],ppublish,Laryngoscope. 2014 Sep;124(9):2043-8. doi: 10.1002/lary.24586.

We analyzed 139 patients with t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1-positive AML (de novo: n=117; therapy-related: n=22) to determine frequency and prognostic impact of additional genetic abnormalities. All patients were investigated for mutations (mut) in ASXL1, FLT3, KIT, NPM1, MLL, IDH1, IDH2, KRAS, NRAS, CBL and JAK2. Sixty-nine of 139 cases (49.6%) had 1 mutation in addition to RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and 23/139 (16.5%) had 2 additional mutations. Most common were KITmut (23/139; 16.5%), NRASmut (18/139; 12.9%) and ASXL1mut (16/139; 11.5%). FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKDmut, CBLmut, KRASmut, IDH2mut and JAK2mut were found in 2.9-5.0%. Additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) were found in 97/139 (69.8%). Two-year overall survival (OS) was 73.4% in 111 intensively treated patients. KITD816mut negatively impacted on OS in de novo AML (2-year OS: 59.1% vs 82.0%, P=0.03), ASXL1mut on EFS (de novo AML: 20% vs 59.1%, P=0.011; total cohort: 28.6% vs 56.7%, P=0.021). Sex chromosome loss was favorable (2-year EFS: 66.9% vs 43.0%, P=0.031), whereas +8 was adverse on EFS (2-year EFS: 26.7% vs 55.9%, P=0.02). In conclusion, t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1-positive AML shows a high frequency of additional genetic alterations. Investigation for KITD816 and ASXL1mut combined with investigation of ACAs is recommended in t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1-positive AML because of the prognostic significance of these parameters.","['Krauth, M-T', 'Eder, C', 'Alpermann, T', 'Bacher, U', 'Nadarajah, N', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, C', 'Haferlach, T', 'Schnittger, S']","['Krauth MT', 'Eder C', 'Alpermann T', 'Bacher U', 'Nadarajah N', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S']","['1] MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany [2] Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recurrence', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20144 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1449-58. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.4.

The first effective BH3 mimetic inhibitors of Bcl-2, ABT-737 and navitoclax, also target Bcl-xL, causing dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. This prompted the development of the Bcl-2-selective antagonist, ABT-199. Here we show that in lymphoid cells, ABT-199 specifically causes Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis that is triggered principally by the initiator BH3-only protein Bim. As expected, malignant cells isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are highly sensitive to ABT-199. However, we found that normal, untransformed mature B cells are also highly sensitive to ABT-199, both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, the B-cell precursors are largely spared, as are cells of myeloid origin. These results pinpoint the probable impact of the pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 by ABT-199 on the normal mature haemopoietic cell lineages in patients, and have implications for monitoring during ABT-199 therapy as well as for the clinical utility of this very promising targeted agent.","['Khaw, S L', 'Merino, D', 'Anderson, M A', 'Glaser, S P', 'Bouillet, P', 'Roberts, A W', 'Huang, D C S']","['Khaw SL', 'Merino D', 'Anderson MA', 'Glaser SP', 'Bouillet P', 'Roberts AW', 'Huang DC']","[""1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia [3] Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia [3] Department of Clinical Haematology and BMT, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia [4] Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia [3] Department of Clinical Haematology and BMT, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia [4] Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia [5] Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bmf protein, mouse)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/physiology']",,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20141 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1207-15. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.1.

In the current study, we compared the clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features of patients with PMF with or without CALR, JAK2 or MPL mutations. Among 254 study patients, 147 (58%) harbored JAK2, 63 (25%) CALR and 21 (8.3%) MPL mutations; 22 (8.7%) patients were negative for all three mutations, whereas one patient expressed both JAK2 and CALR mutations. Study patients were also screened for ASXL1 (31%), EZH2 (6%), IDH (4%), SRSF2 (12%), SF3B1 (7%) and U2AF1 (16%) mutations. In univariate analysis, CALR mutations were associated with younger age (P<0.0001), higher platelet count (P<0.0001) and lower DIPSS-plus score (P=0.02). CALR-mutated patients were also less likely to be anemic, require transfusions or display leukocytosis. Spliceosome mutations were infrequent (P=0.0001) in CALR-mutated patients, but no other molecular or cytogenetic associations were evident.

Here, we have examined the functional importance of IAPs in multiple myeloma (MM) by using a Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases)-mimetic LCL161. We observed that LCL161 was able to potently induce apoptosis in some MM cell lines but not in others. Examining the levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) post LCL161 treatment indicated clear downregulation of both XIAP activity and cIAP1 levels in both the sensitive and less sensitive (resistant) cell lines. cIAP2, however, was not downregulated in the cell line resistant to the drug. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of cIAP2 significantly enhanced the effect of LCL161, indicating the importance of downregulation of all IAPs simultaneously for induction of apoptosis in MM cells. LCL161 induced marked up regulation of the Jak2/Stat3 pathway in the resistant MM cell lines. Combining LCL161 with a Jak2-specific inhibitor resulted in synergistic cell death in MM cell lines and patient cells. In addition, combining LCL161 with death-inducing ligands clearly showed that LCL161 sensitized MM cells to both Fas-ligand and TRAIL.","['Ramakrishnan, V', 'Painuly, U', 'Kimlinger, T', 'Haug, J', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Kumar, S']","['Ramakrishnan V', 'Painuly U', 'Kimlinger T', 'Haug J', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Kumar S']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA [2] 4th Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology University Hospital Hradec Kralove and Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (LCL161)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",PMC4090267,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20142 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1519-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.2.

The purpose of the present study was to further explore the function of Ik6 in B-ALL. The association between Ik6 expression as detected by real-time PCR and efficacy of chemotherapy was evaluated. The effect of the alteration in Ik6 on leukemic cell lines was assessed by in vitro gain-of-function and loss-of-function techniques. PCR analysis showed that Ik6 expression was decreased when patients completed induction chemotherapy and reached complete remission. Ik6 expression was significantly increased when patients suffered relapse. Stable transfection of Ik6 into the Nalm-6 cell line revealed that Ik6 enhanced proliferation of Nalm-6 cells through the promotion of G0/G1-to-S-phase transition and enhanced chemoresistance to chemotherapeutics through anti-apoptotic effects. However, Ik6 expression did not affect the invasion of Nalm-6 cells. In contrast, silencing of Ik6 in Sup-B15 cells significantly inhibited proliferation and increased chemosensitivity. The present study suggests that Ik6 may be a biological marker of chemosensitivity and relapse and Ik6 may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for ALL.","['Zhou, Fen', 'Xu, Yunyun', 'Qiu, Yining', 'Wu, Xiaoyan', 'Zhang, Zhiquan', 'Jin, Runming']","['Zhou F', 'Xu Y', 'Qiu Y', 'Wu X', 'Zhang Z', 'Jin R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, P.R.

A highly potent first-in-class compound targeting Hec1, TAI-1, was identified and is characterized in this study to determine its potential as an anticancer agent for clinical utility. METHODS: The in vitro potency, cancer cell specificity, synergy activity, and markers for response of TAI-1 were evaluated with cell lines. Mechanism of action was confirmed with western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. The in vivo potency of TAI-1 was evaluated in three xenograft models in mice. Preliminary toxicity was evaluated in mice. Specificity to the target was tested with a kinase panel. Cardiac safety was evaluated with hERG assay. Clinical correlation was performed with human gene database. RESULTS: TAI-1 showed strong potency across a broad spectrum of tumor cells. TAI-1 disrupted Hec1-Nek2 protein interaction, led to Nek2 degradation, induced significant chromosomal misalignment in metaphase, and induced apoptotic cell death. TAI-1 was effective orally in in vivo animal models of triple negative breast cancer, colon cancer and liver cancer. Preliminary toxicity shows no effect on the body weights, organ weights, and blood indices at efficacious doses. TAI-1 shows high specificity to cancer cells and to target and had no effect on the cardiac channel hERG. TAI-1 is synergistic with doxorubicin, topotecan and paclitaxel in leukemia, breast and liver cancer cells. Sensitivity to TAI-1 was associated with the status of RB and P53 gene. Knockdown of RB and P53 in cancer cells increased sensitivity to TAI-1. Hec1-overexpressing molecular subtypes of human lung cancer were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The excellent potency, safety and synergistic profiles of this potent first-in-class Hec1-targeted small molecule TAI-1 show its potential for clinically utility in anti-cancer treatment regimens.","['Huang, Lynn Y L', 'Lee, Ying-Shuan', 'Huang, Jiann-Jyh', 'Chang, Chia-chi', 'Chang, Jia-Ming', 'Chuang, Shih-Hsien', 'Kao, Kuo-Jang', 'Tsai, Yung-Jen', 'Tsai, Pei-Yi', 'Liu, Chia-Wei', 'Lin, Her-Sheng', 'Lau, Johnson Y N']","['Huang LY', 'Lee YS', 'Huang JJ', 'Chang CC', 'Chang JM', 'Chuang SH', 'Kao KJ', 'Tsai YJ', 'Tsai PY', 'Liu CW', 'Lin HS', 'Lau JY']","['Taivex Therapeutics Corporation, 17th Floor, No, 3, Yuanqu Street, Nangang District, Taipei City 115, Taiwan. lynnhuang.lh245@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140109,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (NDC80 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (TAI-1 compound)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (NEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (NIMA-Related Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NIMA-Related Kinases', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3895848,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-33-6 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-33-6 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Jan 9;33:6. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-33-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), currently used in clinical diagnostics of CLL, are targeted tests aimed at specific genomic loci. Microarray-based genomic profiling is a new high-resolution tool that enables genome-wide analyses. The aim of this study was to compare two recently launched genomic microarray platforms, i.e., the CytoScan HD Array (Affymetrix) and the HumanOmniExpress Array (Illumina), with FISH and MLPA to ascertain whether these latter tests can be replaced by either one of the microarray platforms in a clinical diagnostic setting. RESULT: Microarray-based genomic profiling and FISH were performed in all 28 CLL patients. For an unbiased comparison of the performance of both microarray platforms 9 patients were evaluated on both platforms, resulting in the identification of exactly identical genomic aberrations. To evaluate the detection limit of the microarray platforms we included 7 patients in which the genomic abnormalities were present in a relatively low percentage of the cells (range 5-28%) as previously determined by FISH. We found that both microarray platforms allowed the detection of copy number abnormalities present in as few as 16% of the cells. In addition, we found that microarray-based genomic profiling allowed the identification of genomic abnormalities that could not be detected by FISH and/or MLPA, including a focal TP53 loss and copy neutral losses of heterozygosity of chromosome 17p. CONCLUSION: From our results we conclude that although the microarray platforms exhibit a somewhat lower limit of detection compared to FISH, they still allow the detection of copy number abnormalities present in as few as 16% of the cells. By applying similar interpretation criteria, the results obtained from both platforms were comparable. In addition, we conclude that both microarray platforms allow the identification of additional potential prognostic relevant abnormalities such as focal TP53 deletions and copy neutral losses of heterozygosity of chromosome 17p, which would have remained undetected by FISH or MLPA. The prognostic relevance of these novel genomic alterations requires further evaluation in prospective clinical trials.","['Stevens-Kroef, Marian Jpl', 'van den Berg, Eva', 'Olde Weghuis, Daniel', 'Geurts van Kessel, Ad', 'Pfundt, Rolph', 'Linssen-Wiersma, Matty', 'Benjamins, Marloes', 'Dijkhuizen, Trijnie', 'Groenen, Patricia Jta', 'Simons, Annet']","['Stevens-Kroef MJ', 'van den Berg E', 'Olde Weghuis D', 'Geurts van Kessel A', 'Pfundt R', 'Linssen-Wiersma M', 'Benjamins M', 'Dijkhuizen T', 'Groenen PJ', 'Simons A']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, P,O, Box 9101, Nijmegen 6500 HB, The Netherlands.

Here, we performed 2 complementary screens to identify FDA-approved drugs and drug-like small molecules with activity against T-ALL. We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward MYC-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-ALL cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-ALL cells. Using ligand-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a perphenazine target. T-ALL cell lines treated with perphenazine exhibited rapid dephosphorylation of multiple PP2A substrates and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, shRNA knockdown of specific PP2A subunits attenuated perphenazine activity, indicating that PP2A mediates the drug's antileukemic activity. Finally, human T-ALLs treated with perphenazine exhibited suppressed cell growth and dephosphorylation of PP2A targets in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the recurring identification of phenothiazines as a class of drugs with anticancer effects. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic PP2A activation in T-ALL and other cancers driven by hyperphosphorylated PP2A substrates has therapeutic potential.","['Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Pan, Li', 'Groen, Richard W J', 'Baleydier, Frederic', 'Kentsis, Alex', 'Marineau, Jason', 'Grebliunaite, Ruta', 'Kozakewich, Elena', 'Reed, Casie', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Poglio, Sandrine', 'Uzan, Benjamin', 'Clemons, Paul', 'VerPlank, Lynn', 'An, Frank', 'Burbank, Jason', 'Norton, Stephanie', 'Tolliday, Nicola', 'Steen, Hanno', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Yuan, Huipin', 'Bradner, James E', 'Mitsiades, Constantine', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Gutierrez A', 'Pan L', 'Groen RW', 'Baleydier F', 'Kentsis A', 'Marineau J', 'Grebliunaite R', 'Kozakewich E', 'Reed C', 'Pflumio F', 'Poglio S', 'Uzan B', 'Clemons P', 'VerPlank L', 'An F', 'Burbank J', 'Norton S', 'Tolliday N', 'Steen H', 'Weng AP', 'Yuan H', 'Bradner JE', 'Mitsiades C', 'Look AT', 'Aster JC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140109,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Dopamine Antagonists)', '0 (Phenothiazines)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'FTA7XXY4EZ (Perphenazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dopamine Antagonists/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Perphenazine/chemistry', 'Phenothiazines/*chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pigmentation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Zebrafish']",PMC3904599,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['65093 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI65093 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Feb;124(2):644-55. doi: 10.1172/JCI65093.

We investigated the benefit of the type 2, glycoengineered antibody obinutuzumab (also known as GA101) as compared with that of rituximab, each combined with chlorambucil, in patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting conditions. METHODS: We randomly assigned 781 patients with previously untreated CLL and a score higher than 6 on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (range, 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating worse health status) or an estimated creatinine clearance of 30 to 69 ml per minute to receive chlorambucil, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil, or rituximab plus chlorambucil. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 73 years, creatinine clearance of 62 ml per minute, and CIRS score of 8 at baseline. Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil or rituximab-chlorambucil, as compared with chlorambucil monotherapy, increased response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (median progression-free survival, 26.7 months with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil vs. 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13 to 0.24; P<0.001; and 16.3 months with rituximab-chlorambucil vs. 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.57; P<0.001). Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, as compared with chlorambucil alone, prolonged overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.74; P=0.002). Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, as compared with rituximab-chlorambucil, resulted in prolongation of progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.49; P<0.001) and higher rates of complete response (20.7% vs. 7.0%) and molecular response. Infusion-related reactions and neutropenia were more common with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil than with rituximab-chlorambucil, but the risk of infection was not increased. CONCLUSIONS: Combining an anti-CD20 antibody with chemotherapy improved outcomes in patients with CLL and coexisting conditions. In this patient population, obinutuzumab was superior to rituximab when each was combined with chlorambucil. (Funded by F.

We reviewed our institutional experience using chemomobilization with high-dose (HD) etoposide (1.6 g/m(2) ) and G-CSF (300 mug/day) in 79 patients with lymphoma. The majority (76%) had received at least two prior regimens of chemotherapy, and 12 (15.2%) patients had previously failed to mobilize following HD cyclophosphamide or DHAP or ICE with G-CSF. HD etoposide and G-CSF chemomobilization resulted in successful collection (>2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg) in 82.3% of patients within a median 2 (1-6) apheresis days. Patients had stem cells collected between days +8 and +15, with a median +12 day. Median total CD34+ cells/kg collected was 5.95 x 10(6) (0.1-36.8). Seventy-one percent of patients yielded >2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg in </=2 d of apheresis and were defined as good mobilizers. While median CD34+ cells/kg collected for good mobilizers was 7.6 x 10(6) , it was 2.6 x 10(6) for poor mobilizers (P < 0.001). This regimen was safe with a low rate of febrile neutropenia (7.6%) and acceptable rates of RBC (40.5%) and platelet transfusions (22.8%). Hematopoietic recovery after auto-SCT was achieved on expected time. Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia occurred in only one patient (1.3%) with in a median follow-up of 16 months after chemomobilization. We conclude that HD etoposide and G-CSF chemomobilization appear to result in effective, tolerable, and safe stem cell collection in the majority of heavily pretreated lymphoma patients.","['Ozkan, Hasan Atilla', 'Bal, Cengiz', 'Gulbas, Zafer']","['Ozkan HA', 'Bal C', 'Gulbas Z']","['Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140215,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/10 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12266 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2014;92(5):390-7. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12266.

Although aCLL has a more aggressive course compared to typical CLL (tCLL), it is not usually reported. This retrospective study used digital microscopy to morphologically classify CLL patients as aCLL or tCLL, and determined the prevalence of prognostic markers in each group. METHODS: CellaVision AB (Lund, Sweden) was used to evaluate lymphocyte morphology on archived blood films of 97 CLL patients, and results of their prognostic marker analysis at diagnosis were obtained. The unpaired t-test, Chi-square, or Fisher's Exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 27% of CLL cases were morphologically classified as aCLL. The aCLL group had a higher prevalence of trisomy 12, unmutated IgVH, and CD38 expression (markers associated with poor prognosis), and a lower prevalence of 13q14 deletions compared to tCLL; this was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Using digital imaging to identify aCLL is feasible, economical, and may provide clinically relevant prognostic information at diagnosis and during periodic monitoring. Further study of a larger number of patients is needed to assess the clinical utility of reporting aCLL morphology.","['Marionneaux, S', 'Maslak, P', 'Keohane, E M']","['Marionneaux S', 'Maslak P', 'Keohane EM']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Rutgers-School of Health Related Professions, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131125,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'Chromosome 12, 12p trisomy']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy/methods', '*Trisomy']",,2014/01/10 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/01/10 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12167 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Aug;36(4):459-64. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12167.

Identification of factors involved in the information exchange between the malignant cells and the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and the knowledge on their functioning may provide important information to eliminate leukemic cells from protective BM niches. We evaluated changes in BM-MSCs obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at different times in the course of disease. Whereas ALL-MSCs did not exhibit phenotypic changes compared to BM-derived MSCs isolated from healthy donors, they exhibited increased adipogenic capacity. In addition, the viability of healthy CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors was significantly reduced when co-cultured with ALL-MSCs. ALL-MSCs grow less efficiently, although gradually recover normal growth with treatment. Accordingly, proliferation is particularly low in MSCs obtained at diagnosis and in the first days of treatment (+15 days), recovering to control levels after 35 days of treatment. Correlating these results with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) production, a molecule demonstrated to affect MSC biology, we found higher production of BMP4 in ALL-MSCs derived from patients over the course of disease but not in those free of leukemia. However, no significant differences in the expression of different members of the BMP4 signaling pathway were observed. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between high levels of BMP4 production in the cultures and MSC proliferation was found, as observed in MSCs derived from patients at diagnosis that produce high BMP4 levels. In addition, co-culturing ALL-MSC with the REH leukemia cell line, but not CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, powerfully enhanced BMP4 production, suggesting an intimate crosstalk among ALL-MSCs isolated from BM colonized by ALL cells that presumably also occurs in situ conditions. Our data may support the participation of BMP4 in BM niche, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated.","['Vicente Lopez, Angeles', 'Vazquez Garcia, Miriam Nohemi', 'Melen, Gustavo J', 'Entrena Martinez, Ana', 'Cubillo Moreno, Isabel', 'Garcia-Castro, Javier', 'Orellana, Manuel Ramirez', 'Gonzalez, Agustin Gregorio Zapata']","['Vicente Lopez A', 'Vazquez Garcia MN', 'Melen GJ', 'Entrena Martinez A', 'Cubillo Moreno I', 'Garcia-Castro J', 'Orellana MR', 'Gonzalez AG']","['Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Oncohematology, Hospital Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular Biotechnology Unit, Institute for Health Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular Biotechnology Unit, Institute for Health Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Oncohematology, Hospital Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140106,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3882230,2014/01/09 06:00,2014/09/11 06:00,['2014/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084496 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-35562 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 6;9(1):e84496. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084496. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the inhibition of VEGF-induced mitogenesis of the recombinant antibody, the bovine aorta endothelial like cells were employed. The results showed specialization and conjunction of the recombinant antibody to the VEGF. It was also indicated that the antibody expression in the K562 cell lines was higher than the CHO cell lines.

Previous research has shown that deregulated AIOLOS expression is associated with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in human patients. However, the function of AIOLOS in childhood B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL is not fully understood. In the present study, Nalm-6 cells were divided into three groups: the untransfected control (UT), the lentiviral vector control (Lenti-Mock) and the AIOLOS-overexpressing (Lenti-AIOLOS) group. Lenti-AIOLOS Nalm-6 cells were constructed by lentiviral transduction, followed by cell proliferation assay, cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis assay, to evaluate the effects of AIOLOS on proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells in vitro. Moreover, the expression levels of genes associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle, as well as the transcription factors IKZF1 and NF-kappaB, were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The results showed that the proliferation of Nalm-6 cells in the Lenti-AIOLOS group was reduced by 16% on day 8 compared with cells in the UT group (P>0.05). The reduction peaked at 29% on day 10 (P<0.05). The percentage of Nalm-6 cells in the G0/G1 phase increased from 70.4 (UT) to 84.1% (Lenti-AIOLOS) (P<0.01), and the S-phase cells decreased from 20.3 (UT) to 11.7% (Lenti-AIOLOS) (P<0.01). Total apoptotic cells significantly decreased in AIOLOS-transfected Nalm-6 cells (10.75%) compared with those in the Lenti-Mock (17.00%) or UT group (19.05%) (P<0.01). In particular, the difference between the groups in the percentage of late apoptotic cells was significant (2.85 vs. 7.95%; P<0.01). In addition, overexpression of AIOLOS resulted in upregulation of BCL-2 and downregulation of CCND3, BAX, IKZF1 and NF-kappaB. No changes were detected on C-MYC and P27. Our findings indicate that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of AIOLOS in Nalm-6 cells could inhibit cell proliferation, suppress cell apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in vitro.","['Zhuang, Yong', 'Li, Dong', 'Fu, Jinqiu', 'Shi, Qing', 'Lu, Yuanyuan', 'Ju, Xiuli']","['Zhuang Y', 'Li D', 'Fu J', 'Shi Q', 'Lu Y', 'Ju X']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

Initial evaluation indicated increased inflammatory markers and blasts on a blood smear. A bone marrow biopsy revealed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and Julie was admitted for induction chemotherapy. Julie was diagnosed with ASD 1 year before this presentation. Her parents, who had immigrated to the United States from China before her birth, indicated that it took them some time to accept the diagnosis of ASD but they were feeling more confident in addressing her behavior challenges and comfortable with the progress she had been making. They now expressed concerns about the possible loss of services in the setting of her hospitalization. At the time of diagnosis, Julie had been receiving in-home behavioral therapy (applied behavioral analysis), speech therapy, and occupational therapy at a hospital-based center. In addition, she had an individualized education plan and was enrolled in a specialized preschool classroom for children with ASD.As Julie's hospital stay became more prolonged, her medical care team started reporting more challenges communicating with Julie without the presence of 1 of her parents, difficulty conducting routine care (e.g., obtaining vitals), sleep disruption, and safety concerns (e.g., Julie would frequently climb on the window sill increasing her fall risk).

Second malignancies after HSCT are a devastating late complication. We analyzed the incidence of, risk compared with that in the general population, and risk factors for secondary solid cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were 17 545 adult recipients of a first allogeneic stem cell transplantation between 1990 and 2007 in Japan. Risks of developing secondary solid tumors were compared with general population by using standard incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: Two-hundred sixty-nine secondary solid cancers were identified. The cumulative incidence was 0.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6%-0.9%] at 5 years and 1.7% (95% CI, 1.4%-1.9%) at 10 years after transplant. The risk was significantly higher than that in the general population (SIR=1.8, 95% CI, 1.5-2.0). Risk was higher for oral cancer (SIR=15.7, 95% CI, 12.1-20.1), esophageal cancer (SIR=8.5, 95% CI, 6.1-11.5), colon cancer (SIR=1.9, 95% CI, 1.2-2.7), skin cancer (SIR=7.2, 95% CI, 3.9-12.4), and brain/nervous system cancer (SIR=4.1, 95% CI, 1.6-8.4). The risk of developing oral, esophageal, or skin cancer was higher at all times after 1-year post-transplant. Extensive-type chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was a significant risk factor for the development of all solid tumors (RR=1.8, P<0.001), as well as for oral (RR=2.9, P<0.001) and esophageal (RR=5.3, P<0.001) cancers. Limited-type chronic GVHD was an independent risk factor for skin cancers (RR=5.8, P=0.016). CONCLUSION: Recipients of allogeneic HSCT had a significantly higher approximately 2-fold risk of developing secondary solid cancers than the general population. Lifelong screening for high-risk organ sites, especially oral or esophageal cancers, is important for recipients with active, or a history of, chronic GVHD.","['Atsuta, Y', 'Suzuki, R', 'Yamashita, T', 'Fukuda, T', 'Miyamura, K', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Iida, H', 'Uchida, T', 'Ikegame, K', 'Takahashi, S', 'Kato, K', 'Kawa, K', 'Nagamura-Inoue, T', 'Morishima, Y', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Kodera, Y']","['Atsuta Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Yamashita T', 'Fukuda T', 'Miyamura K', 'Taniguchi S', 'Iida H', 'Uchida T', 'Ikegame K', 'Takahashi S', 'Kato K', 'Kawa K', 'Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Morishima Y', 'Sakamaki H', 'Kodera Y']","['Department of HSCT Data Management and Biostatistics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140107,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/09 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)36471-3 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdt558 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2014 Feb;25(2):435-41. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdt558.

The median survival of adult patients with thyroid carcinoma that has metastasized to the brain is less than one year. Radioactive iodine treatment is only rarely given because its efficacy is not documented. In children, the situation may be different. METHOD: In 2005, a 15-year-old girl underwent thyroidectomy, and an oxyphilic variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma was found in ectopic thyroid tissue. The patient underwent oral, high-dose radioactive iodine treatment. The post-therapeutic I-131 whole-body scan revealed multiple metastases in the skeleton, lungs, and the soft tissues, along with physiological uptake of the residual thyroid tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed two brain metastases. RESULTS: When the initial treatment was completed, additional age-adapted high-dose radioactive iodine treatment was given, up to a total activity level of 35 GBq. There followed a complete remission of all metastases in the brain, bones, lungs, and soft tissues. Computed tomography of the chest revealed stable residuals. Over the ensuing 7.5 years of follow-up, the thyroglobulin values steadily declined to less than 2 ng/mL. The patient was asymptomatic at her last follow-up in May 2013. She did not develop any delayed reaction to high-dose radioactive iodine treatment (in particular, she did not develop leukemia or any other secondary malignancy). She remained fertile: after completion of the treatment, she had two healthy children. CONCLUSION: In this patient with multifocal thyroid carcinoma, a rare entity, radioactive iodine treatment was successful as the single treatment. This case illustrates the point that a given therapeutic modality might succeed in an individual case despite a total or near-total lack of efficacy for most patients in the same situation.","['Vrachimis, Alexis', 'Schmid, Kurt Werner', 'Jurgens, Heribert', 'Schober, Otmar', 'Weckesser, Matthias', 'Riemann, Burkhard']","['Vrachimis A', 'Schmid KW', 'Jurgens H', 'Schober O', 'Weckesser M', 'Riemann B']","[""Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Munster, Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Children's Hospital-Department for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Papillary/*radiotherapy/*secondary', 'Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/*secondary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3888929,2014/01/09 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2013.0861 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2013.0861 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2013 Dec 13;110(50):861-6. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0861.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies also showed that nicotine-treated dendritic cells have potential antitumor effects. Hence, the precise effects of nicotine on the biological characterizations of cells are controversial. The aim of the present study was to assess the roles of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), Erk1/2-p38-JNK and PI3K-Akt pathway in nicotine-mediated proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects. The results firstly showed that nicotine treatment clearly augmented cell viability and upregulated PCNA expression in both Raw264.7 and El4 cells. Meanwhile, nicotine afforded protection against cisplatin-induced toxicity through inhibiting caspase-3 activation and upregulating anti-apoptotic protein expression. Further exploration demonstrated that nicotine efficiently abolished cisplatin-promoted mitochondria translocation of Bax and the release of cytochrome c. The pretreatment of alpha-bungarotoxin and tubocurarine chloride significantly attenuated nicotine-augmented cell viability, abolished caspase-3 activation and alpha7 nAChR upregulation. Both Erk-JNK-p38 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways could be activated by nicotine treatment in Raw264.7 and El4 cells. Notably, when Erk-JNK and PI3K-Akt activities were inhibited, nicotine-augmented cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects were abolished accordingly. The results presented here indicate that nicotine could achieve alpha7 nAChR-mediated proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects by activating Erk-JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways respectively, providing potential therapeutic molecules to deal with smoking-associated human diseases.","['Wang, Yan Yan', 'Liu, Yao', 'Ni, Xiao Yan', 'Bai, Zhen Huan', 'Chen, Qiong Yun', 'Zhang, Ye', 'Gao, Feng Guang']","['Wang YY', 'Liu Y', 'Ni XY', 'Bai ZH', 'Chen QY', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao FG']","['Basic Medicine Science, Medical College, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, P.R.

Accelerated phase and blast crisis may be associated with extramedulary disease. Extramedullary transformation of CML can be determined both in nodal and extranodal sites. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare in chronic myeloid leukemia and may be misdiagnosed as an extramedullary lymphoid blast transformation; the majorities are T-cell lymphomas with an immature thymic phenotype, while peripheral B-cell lymphomas are rarer. We report the case of a 79-year-old woman carrier Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia who developed at eight months of diagnosis an accelerated phase of CML associated simultaneous with a tumor of soft palate, which was initial considering an extramedullary disease. The patient was treated with specific chemotherapy for accelerated phase of CML (Cytosinarabinoside) + Anagrelide, and reversed to secondary chronic phase of CML, but soft palate tumor persists. The immunohistochemical findings of bone marrow trephine biopsy examination showed chronic phase of CML (negativity for immature cells such as CD34, Tdt) and the biopsy of soft palate tumor and immunohistochemical findings revealed a primitive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with medium B-cells (CD20, CD79a positive) and excluding an extramedullary blast crisis (CD34 negative, Tdt negative). Cytogenetic analysis in tumor revealed absence of Philadelphia chromosome. The patient was treated with local radiotherapy for NHL, with a favorable evolution and Hydroxyurea 1 g/day for CML with hematological remission. A localized lymphoid neoplasm may be an extramedullary localized blast crisis of CML or a distinct malignancy, with distinguished therapy and prognosis. A correct diagnosis based on a complex investigation: immunohistochemistry, conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular analysis (Southern blot and RT-PCR) is necessary.

Our previous study showed that some sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), i.e., helenalin (HE) and parthenolide (PA) but not sclareolide (SC), enhance ATRA-induced differentiation of HL-60 APL cells with no unexpected effects, but the precise mechanism on underlying this synergism is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the distinctive transcriptional profile of cells treated with effective STL compounds, which were identified by comparing the profile with that of cells treated with SC. Genome-wide approaches using cDNA microarrays showed that co-treatment with the differentiation-enhancing STLs HE and PA maximized the transcriptional variation regulated by the suboptimal concentration of ATRA in HL-60 cells. Of the genes of interest, asparagine synthetase was remarkably downregulated by ATRA co-treated with either HE or PA, but not with SC. In an additional analysis for the role of asparagine synthetase, ATRA-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation was enhanced when asparagine in the culture media was depleted by an addition of L-asparaginase, indicating that downregulation of asparagine synthetase gene expression may be involved in the enhanced cell differentiation by STL compounds. These results provide useful insight into differentiation-inducing therapy in the treatment of leukemia.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Cho, Kyung-Min', 'Hwang, Seung Yong', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Kim SH', 'Cho KM', 'Hwang SY', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim TS']","['Department of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Molecular and Life Science and GenoCheck Co.

The antioxidant properties are assumed to enable these compounds to protect cells from oxidative damage, however prooxidant activity are held likely to be responsible for their cytotoxic or pro-apoptotic effects. In present study the effects of resveratrol (Res) and its three derivatives: 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene (M6), 3,4,4',5-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene (M8) and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxy-trans-stilbene (M12) were investigated on T cell leukemia Jurkat cells. The tested compounds have cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and IC50 values obtained in the Alamar blue assay were: 58.4 muM, 48.1 muM, 33.4 muM for and 13.8 muM for Res, M6, M8, M12, respectively. Furthermore, we also observed an increased activity of caspase 3 and 9, with significantly higher values in cells incubated with M8 and M12 than Res and M6. Cell death was accompanied by loss of mitochondrial potential, oxidative stress, decrease of glutathione level as well as loss of both mRNA expression and activity of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Cytotoxic activity may be connected with the formation of short-living prooxidative metabolites as compounds M8 and M12 were very instable in incubation medium. In conclusion, we elucidated the mechanisms responsible for cytotoxicity of hydroxylated resveratrol analogs in leukemia cells which may also apply to other polyphenols.","['Kucinska, Malgorzata', 'Piotrowska, Hanna', 'Luczak, Michal W', 'Mikula-Pietrasik, Justyna', 'Ksiazek, Krzysztof', 'Wozniak, Milena', 'Wierzchowski, Marcin', 'Dudka, Jaroslaw', 'Jager, Walter', 'Murias, Marek']","['Kucinska M', 'Piotrowska H', 'Luczak MW', 'Mikula-Pietrasik J', 'Ksiazek K', 'Wozniak M', 'Wierzchowski M', 'Dudka J', 'Jager W', 'Murias M']","['Department of Toxicology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Toxicology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Metabolic Diseases, 1st Chair of Pediatrics, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Toxicology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Chemical Technology of Drugs, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Medical Biology Unit, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Diagnostics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Toxicology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.

The search for activators of these proteases has therefore deserved particular attention in the field of anticancer drug discovery. Here, a simplified yeast-based screening approach was developed and used to search for activators of caspases-3 and -7, followed by evaluation of the activity of the selected compounds in the human tumor cell lines HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma). By using the yeast approach, two potential activators of caspase-7, 5,6-dihydroxy-7-prenyloxyflavone (1a) and 3-hydroxy-7-geranyloxyflavone (2a), were identified. Unlike the known caspases-3 and -7 activator, the procaspase activating compound-1 (PAC-1), these flavonoids did not interfere with the caspase-3 activity in yeast. Moreover, flavonoids 1a and 2a processed procaspase-7 to the active caspase-7 both in yeast and in vitro processing assays, and inhibited the growth of HL-60 and MCF-7 human tumor cells with higher potencies than PAC-1, particularly in the absence of caspase-3 (MCF-7 cells). In MCF-7 cells, the flavonoids processed procaspase-7, increased its activity and sensitized these cells to the effects of the cytotoxic drug, etoposide. In conclusion, the developed yeast target-based screening assays led to the identification of potential caspase-7 activators. A proof of concept is therefore provided for the effectiveness of the yeast assays in the discovery of caspase activators. Additionally, the identified compounds may pave the way for a new class of caspase activators with improved anticancer properties.","['Pereira, Clara', 'Lopes-Rodrigues, Vanessa', 'Coutinho, Isabel', 'Neves, Marta P', 'Lima, Raquel T', 'Pinto, Madalena', 'Cidade, Honorina', 'Vasconcelos, M Helena', 'Saraiva, Lucilia']","['Pereira C', 'Lopes-Rodrigues V', 'Coutinho I', 'Neves MP', 'Lima RT', 'Pinto M', 'Cidade H', 'Vasconcelos MH', 'Saraiva L']","['REQUIMTE, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; Laboratorio de Microbiologia, Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'Cancer Drug Resistance Group, IPATIMUP - Instituto de Patologia e Imunologia Molecular da Universidade do Porto, Rua Doutor Roberto Frias, 4200 Porto, Portugal; Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (CIIMAR), Universidade do Porto, Rua dos Bragas n degrees 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal.', 'REQUIMTE, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; Laboratorio de Microbiologia, Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (CIIMAR), Universidade do Porto, Rua dos Bragas n degrees 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal; Centro de Quimica Medicinal da Universidade do Porto (CEQUIMED-UP), and Laboratorio de Quimica Organica e Farmaceutica, Departamento de Ciencias Quimicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira n degrees 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'Cancer Drug Resistance Group, IPATIMUP - Instituto de Patologia e Imunologia Molecular da Universidade do Porto, Rua Doutor Roberto Frias, 4200 Porto, Portugal; Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (CIIMAR), Universidade do Porto, Rua dos Bragas n degrees 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal.', 'Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (CIIMAR), Universidade do Porto, Rua dos Bragas n degrees 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal; Centro de Quimica Medicinal da Universidade do Porto (CEQUIMED-UP), and Laboratorio de Quimica Organica e Farmaceutica, Departamento de Ciencias Quimicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira n degrees 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (CIIMAR), Universidade do Porto, Rua dos Bragas n degrees 289, 4050-123 Porto, Portugal; Centro de Quimica Medicinal da Universidade do Porto (CEQUIMED-UP), and Laboratorio de Quimica Organica e Farmaceutica, Departamento de Ciencias Quimicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira n degrees 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'Laboratorio de Microbiologia, Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; Cancer Drug Resistance Group, IPATIMUP - Instituto de Patologia e Imunologia Molecular da Universidade do Porto, Rua Doutor Roberto Frias, 4200 Porto, Portugal.', 'REQUIMTE, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal; Laboratorio de Microbiologia, Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira no. 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.

Of utmost importance was the identification of quasi-identical BcR IGs among unrelated patients with CLL, fittingly coined as ""stereotypy,"" that set the wheels in motion for unraveling the role of antigen(s) in the selection and expansion of the leukemic clones. The categorization of CLL clones into ""subsets"" according to shared BcR IG structural characteristics provided a compartmentalized view of this otherwise heterogeneous disease, which eventually led to defining strikingly homogeneous groups of patients in terms of: (i) functional properties of the clonal BcR IGs, e.g. BcR reactivity and signaling; (ii) clonal genetic landscape, e.g. genomic aberrations, gene expression/methylation profiles, microRNA signatures; and (iii) clinical course and outcome. The remarkable restriction of the CLL IG gene repertoire, resulting to a great degree from the high impact of BcR IG stereotypy, may also prompt speculations regarding CLL ontogenesis. Overall, the BcR IG molecule justifiably lies at the heart of CLL clinical research, holding the promise of subset-tailored therapies.","['Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Vardi, Anna', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Agathangelidis A', 'Vardi A', 'Baliakas P', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute , Milan , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140317,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2014/01/09 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.879715 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Oct;55(10):2252-61. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.879715.

Certain HOXA cluster genes and MEIS1 genes are upregulated in patients and mouse models that express CALM-AF10. Wild-type clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM) primarily localizes in a diffuse pattern within the cytoplasm, whereas AF10 localizes in the nucleus; however, it is not clear where CALM-AF10 acts to induce leukemia. To investigate the influence of localization on leukemogenesis involving CALM-AF10, we determined the nuclear export signal (NES) within CALM that is necessary and sufficient for cytoplasmic localization of CALM-AF10. Mutations in the NES eliminated the capacity of CALM-AF10 to immortalize murine bone-marrow cells in vitro and to promote development of acute myeloid leukemia in mouse models. Furthermore, a fusion of AF10 with the minimal NES can immortalize bone-marrow cells and induce leukemia in mice. These results suggest that during leukemogenesis, CALM-AF10 plays its critical roles in the cytoplasm.","['Suzuki, Mai', 'Yamagata, Kazutsune', 'Shino, Mika', 'Aikawa, Yukiko', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Watanabe, Toshio', 'Kitabayashi, Issay']","['Suzuki M', 'Yamagata K', 'Shino M', 'Aikawa Y', 'Akashi K', 'Watanabe T', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140213,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Mllt10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Export Signals', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4317939,2014/01/09 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2014/01/09 06:00'],"['2013/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12347 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Mar;105(3):315-23. doi: 10.1111/cas.12347.

In CML, Philadelphia chromosome is present leading to resistance to cell death and rapid proliferation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the different responses, toxicity and survival of Saudi CML patients to imatinib mesylate. METHODS: All newly diagnosed CML patients who were treated with imatinib were included in this study. We investigated haematological, and molecular and cytogenetic responses by CBC, FISH and RT-PCR respectively. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assayed using AUC and TUNEL respectively. RESULTS: Of the 12 cases, 9 (75%) were males and 3 (25%) were female. Four (33%) of the cases were diagnosed incidentally and 8 cases (67%) presented mainly with fatigue (75%), fever (58%), and splenomegaly (83%). Signs of bleeding and rashes were rare at presentation. The majority of patients had low risk (8, 67%), and 33% had intermediate risk; but none of them had high risk CML. At the last follow up, 11 (92%) were in remissions. One patient (8%) was in remission after 3 years, 4 (33%) were in remission after 6 years, one was in remission after 7 years and 5 (42%) were in remission after 10 years. Only one patient had incomplete major molecular response (MMR) to imatinib after 12 years. The majority of the patients (10, 83%) were in MMR after 6 years and 42% of them were in MMR after 10 years of therapy. Adverse effects of imatinib were not reported by the patients. Imatinib treatment resulted in the reduction of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of CML CFU-GM cells. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate is capable of treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive CP-CML without any adverse effects.","['Alenzi, Faris Q', 'Al-Amri, Ali M', 'Alanazi, Fahad G B', 'Tamimi, Waleed', 'Alanazi, Ayad', 'Alenezy, Awwad K', 'Al-Swailmi, Farhan']","['Alenzi FQ', 'Al-Amri AM', 'Alanazi FG', 'Tamimi W', 'Alanazi A', 'Alenezy AK', 'Al-Swailmi F']","['College of Applied Medical Sciences, Salman bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. fqalenzi@ksu.edu.sa', 'Internal Medicine Department, College of Medicine, University of Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pharmacy Department, MoH, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, KAMC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Internal Medicine Department, College of Medicine, University of Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'Military Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical College, Northern Borders University, Arar,']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2012/04/01 00:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2014/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2012 Apr-Jun;24(2):122-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a rare entity, and mostly accompanied by acute myeloid leukemia. It is observed during the course of myeloproliferative disorders especially in chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. In some rare circumstances, it is detected before clinical signs of leukemia or other diseases. When the bone marrow biopsy reveals no other hematologic malignancies, the granulocytic sarcoma is described as nonleukemic, primary or isolated. It is observed at any part of the body but the most common locations are soft tissues, bone, peritoneum and lymph nodes. Presenting signs or symptoms are mainly due to mass effect of the tumor and dysfunction of the organ, or the tissue that is affected. The diagnosis is performed by biopsy of the tumor. The tumor consists of immature granulocytic cells, which could be documented by H&E, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric methods. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and molecular analysis are also performed. The optimal time and type of treatment is not clear. Surgery could be an option especially for tumors, which cause organ dysfunction and/or obstruction. Systemic treatment should be considered in all patients because without systemic treatment, relapses and progression to acute myeloid leukemia is the ultimate fate of the disease in many cases. Cytarabine-containing remission-induction chemotherapies have been the most applied therapeutic strategies, but it is not clear whether the consolidation therapies are required or not, and what kind of regimens are appropriate. The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSC) as a consolidation regimen is not clear, but, after the relapse of the disease with or without bone marrow involvement, HSC transplantation should be considered in suitable patients after the reinduction performed by AML chemotherapies. There is only limited data about the role of radiotherapy in these patients. It could be used in patients with relapsed disease, organ dysfunction which should be quickly relieved and inadequate response to chemotherapy. The effect of radiotherapy on overall survival is not known. New prospective studies and clinical trials are needed to generate guidelines for the treatment of primary granulocytic sarcomas.","['Yilmaz, Asu Fergun', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Sahin, Fahri', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Yilmaz AF', 'Saydam G', 'Sahin F', 'Baran Y']","['Department of Hematology, Medical School, Ege University Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical School, Ege University Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical School, Ege University Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Science Faculty, Izmir Institute of Technology Urla, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131218,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,PMC3875275,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/01/08 06:01,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2013/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2013 Dec 18;3(4):265-70.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Granulocytic sarcoma', 'chemotherapy', 'leukemia', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, a typical Christmas Tree structure with two inlets was designed as the first mixture gradient generator, upon which the second diffusion gradient generator was coupled to produce the desired concentration series on the basis of the distance difference. Rather than a simple 1D line, the integration of the two generators would result in an innovative 2D matrix of reservoirs, which was then characterized both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, calculation of fluid field demonstrated the formation of a concentration gradient, which was then confirmed by the dye solution visualization analysis. For high throughput screening application, doxorubicin (Dox) was then selected as model medicine to treat the acute myeloblastic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Cell viability displayed that cell death rate enhanced with the increase of drug concentration, and this result was higher than that on a 96-well plate, and the corresponding mechanism was properly discussed. Subsequently, Dox and quercetin were employed simultaneously to generate an overlapping gradient and its effect on HL-60 cells was investigated. Due to the automatic formation of concentration gradient that could improve the work efficiency, this work provides a promising tool for future high throughput drug screening.","['Hu, Shan-Wen', 'Xu, Bi-Yi', 'Xu, Jing-Juan', 'Chen, Hong-Yuan']","['Hu SW', 'Xu BY', 'Xu JJ', 'Chen HY']","['State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131210,United States,Biomicrofluidics,Biomicrofluidics,101293825,,,,PMC3874053,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/01/08 06:01,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1063/1.4847815 [doi]', '020306BMF [pii]']",epublish,Biomicrofluidics. 2013 Dec 10;7(6):64116. doi: 10.1063/1.4847815. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, adhesion of hematopoietic tumor cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix via beta1 integrins (alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1) is crucial in this process. In the current study, the viability and antiapoptotic ability of U937 cells exposed to daunorubicin (DNR) were shown to be enhanced when cocultured with the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or MSCs transduced with a recombinant adeno-LacZ vector (MSCs-LacZ), followed by upregulation of the adhesion rate of leukemic cells. Notably, cell viability, antiapoptotic and adhesive ability were reversed when U937 cells were cocultured with the MSCs transduced with a recombinant adeno-IFN-gamma vector (MSCs-IFN-gamma). Transwell assay showed that cell-cell contact is essential for the protective effects of unmodified MSC and the antitumor effects of IFN-gamma-expressing MSCs. Western blot analysis and caspase activity assay results indicated that the alpha4beta1 integrin/ILK/apoptosis pathway contributes to the combination effects of DNR and MSCs-IFN-gamma, which was further confirmed by the results of the alpha4beta1 integrin siRNA experiments. Thus, gene-modified MSCs expressing IFN-gamma may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNR against leukemic cells through downregulation of the alpha4beta1 pathway and may present a novel promising therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Hua', 'Wang, Liang', 'Wang, Wei-DA', 'Geng, Qi-Rong', 'Lu, Yue']","['Zhang J', 'Wang H', 'Wang L', 'Wang WD', 'Geng QR', 'Lu Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, P.R.

DATA SOURCES: Pertinent data were identified through a search of PubMed (January 1990-April 2013) using the primary search terms SKI-606, bosutinib, and CML. Additionally, preliminary reports published in abstract form by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society of Hematology (January 1990-April 2013) were screened for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies reported in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of bosutinib in patients with CML were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bosutinib is a TKI of the breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) gene approved by the Food and Drug Administration on September 4, 2012, for second-line treatment of chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase CML. In the second-line setting, bosutinib is effective in some patients with CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib, dasatinib, and/or nilotinib, but it is not effective in patients whose disease expresses the T315I point mutation in BCR-ABL. Bosutinib also has been compared with imatinib, the standard first-line treatment, in 502 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML in a Phase 3 trial. Complete cytogenetic response at 12 months, the primary efficacy end point, is similar between bosutinib and imatinib (p = 0.601); therefore, bosutinib is not indicated in the first-line setting. Common adverse events associated with bosutinib include diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in at least 5% of bosutinib-treated patients include elevated serum lipase and liver aminotransferases, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available clinical trials suggest that bosutinib is generally a safe and effective treatment option for patients with CML who have failed first-line TKIs and who do not express the T315I mutation; however, tolerability may be problematic for some patients.","['Stansfield, Lindsay', 'Hughes, Thomas E', 'Walsh-Chocolaad, Tracey L']","['Stansfield L', 'Hughes TE', 'Walsh-Chocolaad TL']","['National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/*therapeutic use']",,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['47/12/1703 [pii]', '10.1177/1060028013503124 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2013 Dec;47(12):1703-11. doi: 10.1177/1060028013503124.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'bosutinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, several time-dependent-receiver operating characteristic curve and AUC(t) have been proposed. One of the most used, the cumulative/dynamic AUC(C,D)(t) is the probability that, given two randomly chosen patients, one having failed before t and the other having failed after t, the prognostic marker will be correctly ranked. In this paper, we propose a weighted AUC(C,D)(t) with time- and data-dependent weights as a summary measure of the mean AUC(C,D)(t), restricted to a finite time range to ensure its clinical relevance. A simulation study shows that estimated restricted mean AUC increased with the strength of association of the covariate with the outcome, with low impact of censoring, and adequate coverage of bootstrap confidence intervals. We illustrate this methodology to two real datasets from two randomized clinical trials to assess the prognostic factors of the overall mortality in patients who have compensated cirrhosis and to assess the prognostic factors of event-free survival in patients who have acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lambert, Jerome', 'Chevret, Sylvie']","['Lambert J', 'Chevret S']","['INSERM, UMR 717, Paris, France jerome.lambert@univ-paris-diderot.fr.', 'INSERM, UMR 717, Paris, France Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France AP-HP, Hopital Saint Louis, Service de Biostatistique et Information Medicale, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140105,England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,,IM,"['Area Under Curve', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Fibrosis/diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', '*ROC Curve', 'Time Factors']",,2014/01/08 06:00,2018/04/26 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['0962280213515571 [pii]', '10.1177/0962280213515571 [doi]']",ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2016 Oct;25(5):2088-2102. doi: 10.1177/0962280213515571.

Here we present a computational approach for investigation of chromatin-state plasticity. We applied this approach to investigate an ENCODE ChIP-seq dataset profiling the genome-wide distributions of the H3K27me3 mark in 19 human cell lines. We found that the high plasticity regions (HPRs) can be divided into two functionally and mechanistically distinct subsets, which correspond to CpG island (CGI) proximal or distal regions, respectively. Although the CGI proximal HPRs are typically associated with continuous variation across different cell-types, the distal HPRs are associated with binary-like variations. We developed a computational approach to predict putative cell-type-specific modulators of H3K27me3 patterns and validated the predictions by comparing with public ChIP-seq data. Furthermore, we applied this approach to investigate mechanisms for poised enhancer establishment in primary human erythroid precursors. Importantly, we predicted and experimentally validated that the principal hematopoietic regulator T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (TAL1) is involved in regulating H3K27me3 variations in collaboration with the transcription factor growth factor independent 1B (GFI1B), providing fresh insights into the context-specific role of TAL1 in erythropoiesis. Our approach is generally applicable to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of epigenetic pathways in establishing cellular identity.","['Pinello, Luca', 'Xu, Jian', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Yuan, Guo-Cheng']","['Pinello L', 'Xu J', 'Orkin SH', 'Yuan GC']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Heath, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140106,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Area Under Curve', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'CpG Islands', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Histones/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors']",PMC3903219,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1322570111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1322570111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 21;111(3):E344-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1322570111.

Here we report that Bcl-2 binds dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), a protein kinase A (PKA)-activated and calcineurin (CaN)-deactivated inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Bcl-2 docks DARPP-32 and CaN in a complex on the InsP3R, creating a negative feedback loop that prevents exaggerated Ca(2+) release by decreasing PKA-mediated InsP3R phosphorylation. T-cell activation increases PKA activity, phosphorylating both the InsP3R and DARPP-32. Phosphorylated DARPP-32 inhibits PP1, enhancing InsP3R phosphorylation and Ca(2+) release. Elevated Ca(2+) activates CaN, which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 to dampen Ca(2+) release by eliminating PP1 inhibition to enable it to dephosphorylate the InsP3R. Knocking down either Bcl-2 or DARPP-32 abrogates this feedback mechanism, resulting in increased Ca(2+) elevation and apoptosis. This feedback mechanism appears to be exploited by high levels of Bcl-2 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, repressing B-cell receptor-induced Ca(2+) elevation and apoptosis.","['Chang, Ming-Jin', 'Zhong, Fei', 'Lavik, Andrew R', 'Parys, Jan B', 'Berridge, Michael J', 'Distelhorst, Clark W']","['Chang MJ', 'Zhong F', 'Lavik AR', 'Parys JB', 'Berridge MJ', 'Distelhorst CW']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140106,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (PPP1R1B protein, human)', '0 (Ppp1r1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3903247,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1323098111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1323098111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 21;111(3):1186-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1323098111.

Like the previous case, the transaminase elevation resolved within a week. LFT abnormalities induced by rATG during conditioning therapy for HSCT may be transient and have a rapid onset after the first dose, but quickly subside without any complications or sequelae.

To reduce SMN risk, 6MP starting doses were reduced to 50 mg/m(2)/day for patients with TPMT heterozygosity in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2000 protocol. PROCEDURE: We explored the pattern of SMN and relapse in the NOPHO ALL2000 protocol (n = 674) and NOPHO ALL92 protocol (n = 601) in relation to TPMT pheno- and/or genotype. RESULTS: The overall risk of any event did not differ significantly between the two protocols. However, in event pattern analyses considering only the patients with TPMT(LA) who experienced relapse or SMN, the risk of SMN versus leukemia relapse was significantly lower in the ALL2000 cohort for patients with a 6MP starting dose <75 mg/m(2)/day when compared to the patients in ALL92 (relapse (n = 11) and SMN (n = 0) in ALL2000 versus relapse (n = 5) and SMN (n = 4) in ALL92, P = 0.03). Furthermore, the 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse for patients with TPMT(LA) was significantly higher in the ALL2000 compared to the ALL92 cohort (19.7% (11.6-33.3%) vs. 6.7% (2.9-15.5%), P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that reducing 6MP starting dose for patients with TPMT(LA) may reduce SMN risk but lead to a relapse risk similar to that of patients with TPMT(WT).","['Levinsen, Mette', 'Rotevatn, Elisabeth Orskov', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Appell, Malin Lindqvist', 'Bergan, Stein', 'Bechensteen, Anne-Grete', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Maxild, Jakob Bernhard Cohn', 'Niemi, Mikko', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Levinsen M', 'Rotevatn EO', 'Rosthoj S', 'Nersting J', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Appell ML', 'Bergan S', 'Bechensteen AG', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Heyman M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Maxild JB', 'Niemi M', 'Soderhall S', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140103,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24921 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):797-802. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24921.

PROCEDURE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 275 participants (median age, 17 [9-36.1] years) with age- and gender-specific LS-BMD Z-scores <0 to receive nutritional counseling with supplementation of 1,000 mg/day calcium and 800 International Unit cholecalciferol or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome was change in LS-BMD assessed by quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) at 24 months. Linear regression models were employed to identify the baseline risk factors for low LS-BMD and to compare LS-BMD outcomes. RESULTS: Pre-randomization LS-BMD below the mean was associated with male gender (P = 0.0024), White race (P = 0.0003), lower body mass index (P < 0.0001), and cumulative glucocorticoid doses of >/= 5,000 mg (P = 0.0012). One hundred eighty-eight (68%) participants completed the study; 77% adhered to the intervention. Mean LS-BMD change did not differ between survivors randomized to supplements (0.33 +/- 0.57) or placebo (0.28 +/- 0.56). Participants aged 9-13 years and those 22-35 years had the greatest mean increases in LS-BMD (0.50 +/- 0.66 and 0.37 +/- 0.23, respectively). Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25[OH]D <30 ng/ml) found in 296 (75%), was not associated with LS-BMD outcomes (P = 0.78).

Remarkably, inducible Cre-mediated deletion of even a single Mcl-1 allele substantially impaired the growth of c-MYC-driven mouse lymphomas. Mutations in p53 could diminish but not obviate the dependency of c-MYC-driven mouse lymphomas on MCL-1. Importantly, targeting of MCL-1 killed c-MYC-driven human Burkitt lymphoma cells, even those bearing mutations in p53.

With the introduction of the first targeted CD20 antibody rituximab and its addition to chemotherapy came the first observation that minimal residual disease-negative (MRD-negative) complete responses (CRs) could be obtained with dramatically improved progression-free survival and overall survival. This advance was soon to be surpassed by the introduction of therapeutics that target B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. New data show that BCR-inhibiting agents are very active for the treatment of relapsed CLL, despite the lack of MRD-negative CR, with durability of response being considerably more impressive than previously observed with other agents not producing MRD-negative CRs. This perspective provides a view of where these agents may take us in the future as CLL therapy evolves with this exciting new class of drugs.","['Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Byrd, John C']","['Jones JA', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Remission Induction']",PMC3945859,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35917-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-09-453092 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 6;123(10):1455-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-09-453092.

Compared with normal stem/progenitor cells, BCR-ABL1(+) progenitors had similar expression of very late antigen-4 (VLA4), VLA5, leukocyte functional antigen-1, and CXCR4 but lower expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and of L-selectin. Whereas vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin were not required, deficiency of E-selectin in the recipient bone marrow endothelium significantly reduced engraftment by BCR-ABL1-expressing stem cells following intravenous injection, with leukemogenesis restored by direct intrafemoral injection. BCR-ABL1-expressing cells deficient for PSGL-1 or the selectin ligand-synthesizing enzymes core-2 beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase or fucosyltransferases IV/VII were impaired for engraftment, and destruction of selectin ligands on leukemic progenitors by neuraminidase reduced engraftment. BCR-ABL1-expressing L-selectin-deficient progenitors were also defective in homing and engraftment, with leukemogenesis rescued by coexpression of chimeric E/L-selectin. Antibody to L-selectin decreased the engraftment of BCR-ABL1-transduced stem cells. These results establish that BCR-ABL1(+) leukemic stem cells rely to a greater extent on selectins and their ligands for homing and engraftment than do normal stem cells. Selectin blockade is a novel strategy to exploit differences between normal and leukemic stem cells that may be beneficial in autologous transplantation for CML and perhaps other leukemias.","['Krause, Daniela S', 'Lazarides, Katherine', 'Lewis, Juliana B', 'von Andrian, Ulrich H', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Krause DS', 'Lazarides K', 'Lewis JB', 'von Andrian UH', 'Van Etten RA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Selectins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Selectins/*physiology', '*Stem Cell Niche']",PMC3938148,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35960-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-11-538694 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 27;123(9):1361-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-11-538694.

However, the exact mechanism of LEF-1 downregulation is unclear. CN patients are responsive to therapeutically high doses of G-CSF and are at increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia. The normal expression of LEF-1 in monocytes and lymphocytes, whose differentiation is unaffected in CN, suggests the presence of a granulopoiesis-specific mechanism downstream of G-CSF receptor signaling that leads to LEF-1 downregulation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is activated by G-CSF and is hyperactivated in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we investigated the effects of activated STAT5 on LEF-1 expression and functions in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We demonstrated that constitutively active STAT5a (caSTAT5a) inhibited LEF-1-dependent autoregulation of the LEF-1 gene promoter by binding to the LEF-1 protein, recruiting Nemo-like kinase and the E3 ubiquitin-ligase NARF to LEF-1, leading to LEF-1 ubiquitination and a reduction in LEF-1 protein levels. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib reversed the defective G-CSF-triggered granulocytic differentiation of CD34(+) cells from CN patients in vitro, an effect that was accompanied by restoration of LEF-1 protein levels and LEF-1 messenger RNA autoregulation. Taken together, our data define a novel mechanism of LEF-1 downregulation in CN patients via enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of LEF-1 protein by hyperactivated STAT5.","['Gupta, Kshama', 'Kuznetsova, Inna', 'Klimenkova, Olga', 'Klimiankou, Maksim', 'Meyer, Johann', 'Moore, Malcolm A S', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl', 'Skokowa, Julia']","['Gupta K', 'Kuznetsova I', 'Klimenkova O', 'Klimiankou M', 'Meyer J', 'Moore MA', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K', 'Skokowa J']","['Department of Molecular Hematopoiesis, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/physiology']",PMC4968380,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/06/06 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35751-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-09-456889 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Apr 17;123(16):2550-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-456889.

Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) are hypothesized to be resistant to chemotherapy and to mediate relapse. We and others have shown that Notch1 directly regulates c-Myc, a known regulator of quiescence in stem and progenitor populations, leading us to examine whether c-Myc inhibition results in efficient targeting of T-ALL-initiating cells. We demonstrate that c-Myc suppression by small hairpin RNA or pharmacologic approaches prevents leukemia initiation in mice by eliminating LIC activity. Consistent with its anti-LIC activity in mice, treatment with the BET bromodomain BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 reduces C-MYC expression and inhibits the growth of relapsed and IF pediatric T-ALL samples in vitro. These findings demonstrate a critical role for c-Myc in LIC maintenance and provide evidence that MYC inhibition may be an effective therapy for relapsed/IF T-ALL patients.","['Roderick, Justine E', 'Tesell, Jessica', 'Shultz, Leonard D', 'Brehm, Michael A', 'Greiner, Dale L', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Qi, Jun', 'Bradner, James E', 'Kelliher, Michelle A']","['Roderick JE', 'Tesell J', 'Shultz LD', 'Brehm MA', 'Greiner DL', 'Harris MH', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE', 'Gutierrez A', 'Look AT', 'Qi J', 'Bradner JE', 'Kelliher MA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure']",PMC3924926,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/04/22 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36021-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-08-522698 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 13;123(7):1040-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-08-522698.

Here we investigated the expression and function of these pathways in acute T lymphocytic leukemia cells (T-ALL). Profiling of Hh pathway members revealed common expression of key Hh signaling effectors in all T-ALL cells. We found that T-ALL cells were insensitive to specific Smoothened (SMO) inhibition following the use of low concentrations of the SMO antagonist cyclopamine. In contrast, treatment with the novel GLI antagonist GANT58 reduced expression of the target gene Patched 1 as well as GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1) and preferentially decreased the viability of T-ALL cells. We also found perifosine, a novel AKT inhibitor, down-regulated GLI1 protein by dephosphorylation of AKT and GSK3beta dose-dependently and that pre-treatment with PD98059, a MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor, enhanced this down-regulation by 20%-30%. Then we questioned whether use of both GANT58 and AKT inhibitor together could confer a synergistic effect to decrease T-ALL cell viability. By applying the Chou-Talalay method, low concentration of GANT58 induced T-ALL cell death in a synergism fashion with perifosine or GSK690693 when used simultaneously. These findings indicate that the combined use of GANT58 and AKT inhibitor could help treat a broad range of malignant tumors in conjunction with existing cancer treatments.","['Hou, Xiaoming', 'Chen, Xing', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Fan, Youfei', 'Ma, Aihua', 'Pang, Tingting', 'Song, Zhao', 'Jin, Youpeng', 'Hao, Wei', 'Liu, Fengqin', 'Wang, Wei', 'Wang, Yulin']","['Hou X', 'Chen X', 'Zhang P', 'Fan Y', 'Ma A', 'Pang T', 'Song Z', 'Jin Y', 'Hao W', 'Liu F', 'Wang W', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Shandong University, Jinan, PR China.

Since hyperosmotic stress (HOS) is a hallmark of diseases such as diabetes and asthma, we analysed the impact of HOS on cytokine-stimulated STAT3 signalling. In contrast to transient STAT3 Y705 and S727 phosphorylation in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stimulated by the interleukin-6 family cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), under non-stress conditions, HOS induced by sorbitol treatment increased STAT3 S727 but not Y705 phosphorylation. Strikingly, combined LIF+HOS treatment stimulated persistent STAT3 Y705 and S727 phosphorylation and nuclear localisation, but STAT3 nuclear accumulation was slowed during HOS, likely reflecting the mislocalisation of Ran and importin-alpha3 during HOS that also reduced the nuclear localisation of classical importin-alpha/beta-recognised nuclear import cargoes. Strikingly, combined LIF+HOS exposure, even though stimulating STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation did not elicit a transcriptional output, as demonstrated by qPCR analyses of its target genes SOCS3 and c-Fos. Our analysis thus shows for the first time that HOS can disconnect nuclear, phosphorylated STAT3 from transcriptional outcomes, and emphasizes the importance of assessing STAT3 target gene changes in addition to STAT3 phosphorylation status and localisation.","['Ng, Ivan H W', 'Jans, David A', 'Bogoyevitch, Marie A']","['Ng IH', 'Jans DA', 'Bogoyevitch MA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Victoria 3800, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Victoria 3800, Australia.

Repressed cation channel subunits and cAMP signaling activators and transducers are overrepresented, potentially indicating a reduced cellular potential to receive and propagate apoptotic signals. Furthermore, we report specific DNA methylation alterations with concurrent gene expression changes within individual ALL subtypes. The ETV6-RUNX1 translocation was associated with downregulation of ASNS and upregulation of the EPO-receptor, while Hyperdiploid patients (> 50 chr) displayed upregulation of B-cell lymphoma (BCL) members and repression of PTPRG and FHIT.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An online physician-administered medical chart review was used to retrospectively collect information from 108 US-based hematologists and oncologists on CML-CP patients who initiated imatinib as first-line therapy and failed to achieve CCyR at 12 months after imatinib initiation. Patients who switched to a second-generation TKI within 3 months after the CCyR failure were defined as timely switchers, and those who continued taking imatinib for at least 3 months after the CCyR failure were defined as nonswitchers. CCyR achievement was compared between timely switchers and nonswitchers using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Physicians provided information on 593 patients, with 306 defined as timely switchers and 287 defined as nonswitchers. Among the nonswitchers, 78 switched to a second-generation TKI at a later date. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, timely switchers had statistically significantly greater likelihood of achieving CCyR (hazard ratio, 1.80; P = .002) compared with nonswitchers. CONCLUSION: Timely switching from imatinib to a second-generation TKI after CCyR failure 1 year after imatinib initiation was associated with a greater likelihood of achieving CCyR compared with delaying the switch or not switching to a second-generation TKI.","['DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Chen, Lei', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Styles, Amy', 'Giguere-Duval, Philippe', 'Wu, Eric Q']","['DeAngelo DJ', 'Chen L', 'Guerin A', 'Styles A', 'Giguere-Duval P', 'Wu EQ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ.', 'Analysis Group, Inc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expressions of Bmi-1 in GC were increased compared with those of the non-cancerous gastric tissues (P = 0.012 and P = 0.000, respectively). Bmi-1 mRNA expression was positively correlated with tumor size, degree of tumor differentiation, invasion and lymph node metastasis. At both mRNA and protein levels, Bmi-1 was positively correlated with c-Myc and EZH2, but negatively correlated with PTEN and E-cadherin.

After more than a decade of legal battles surrounding its patentability, the Supreme Court of India gave its final decision on April 1st of 2013, rejecting the appeal of the Swiss giant drug manufacturer. In 2006, the Indian Patent Office first refused Glivec's patent under Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act arguing that it was only a modified version of an existing drug, Imatinib, and therefore that the drug was not innovative. Novartis replied filing legal challenges against the Indian government but the final verdict in April of 2013 ends the battle. Indeed, the Supreme Court stated that even if the bioavailability of the drug was improved, it did not demonstrate enhanced efficacy and that Glivec was not patentable. METHODS: The research primarily focused on journal, newspaper and magazine articles relevant to the time frame of the lawsuit (from 1994 to 2013) as well as news searches through Google, Factiva, ProQuest, PubMed, and YouTube where press articles from court verdicts were obtained by using the following keywords: ""India"", ""Novartis"", ""Glivec"", ""Patent"", ""Novartis Case"", and ""Supreme Court of India"". The data sources were interpreted and analyzed according to the authors' own prior knowledge and understanding of the exigencies of the TRIPS Agreement. RESULTS: This case illuminates how India is interpreting international law to fit domestic public health needs. CONCLUSIONS: The Novartis case arguably sets an important precedent for the global pharmaceutical industry and ideally will help improve access to lifesaving medicines in the developing world by demanding that patient health needs supersede commercial interests. The Supreme Court of India's decision may affect the interpretation of the article of the TRIPS Agreement, which states members shall be free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of this Agreement within their own legal system and practice.","['Gabble, Ravinder', 'Kohler, Jillian Clare']","['Gabble R', 'Kohler JC']","['Associate Professor and Director Global Health, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, & Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, 144 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3 M2, Canada.

Despite advances in treatment and outcomes for ALL patients, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Microarray analysis of samples from 100 Chinese children with ALL revealed the up-regulation of CTCF (CCCTC binding factor). CTCF is a highly conserved 11-zinc finger protein that is involved in many human cancers; however, the biological function of CTCF in pediatric ALL is unknown. METHODS: The expression patterns of CTCF were evaluated in matched newly diagnosed (ND), complete remission (CR), and relapsed (RE) bone marrow samples from 28 patients. The potential oncogenic mechanism of CTCF and related pathways in leukemogenesis were investigated in leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: We identified significant up-regulation of CTCF in the ND samples. Importantly, the expression of CTCF returned to normal levels after CR but rebounded in the RE samples. In the pre-B ALL cell line Nalm-6, siRNA-mediated silencing of CTCF expression promoted cell apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation; accordingly, over-expression of a cDNA encoding full-length CTCF protected cells from apoptosis and enhanced cell proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition or activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway resulted in marked variations in the levels of CTCF mRNA and protein in leukemic cells, indicating that CTCF may be involved downstream of the NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway increased cell apoptosis, which was partially rescued by ectopic over-expression of CTCF, suggesting that CTCF may play a significant role in the anti-apoptotic pathway mediated by NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CTCF serves as both an anti-apoptotic factor and a proliferative factor in leukemic cells. It potentially contributes to leukemogenesis through the NF-kappaB pathway in pediatric ALL patients.","['Zhang, Han', 'Zhu, Lin', 'He, Huacheng', 'Zhu, Shanshan', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Zhao, Xiaoxi', 'Gao, Chao', 'Mei, Mei', 'Bao, Shilai', 'Zheng, Huyong']","['Zhang H', 'Zhu L', 'He H', 'Zhu S', 'Zhang W', 'Liu X', 'Zhao X', 'Gao C', 'Mei M', 'Bao S', 'Zheng H']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045, China. slbao@genetics.ac.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140107,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3928924,2014/01/08 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/01/08 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-5 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Jan 7;13:5. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean HRQL scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a period of 5 years following diagnosis. Total costs of treatment were determined from variables in administrative databases in a universally accessible and publicly funded healthcare system. Valid HRQL assessments (n = 1200) were collected for 307 BFM and 317 DFCI patients, with costs measured for 66 BFM and 28 DFCI patients. QALYs per patient were <1.0% greater for BFM than DFCI. Median HRQL scores revealed no difference in QALYs. The difference in mean total costs for BFM (US$88 480) and DFCI (US$93 026) was not significant (P = 0.600).

Moreover, neither the presence of 13q deletion nor the percentage of cells carrying the deletion strictly correlated with miRNAs expression levels, although a significant number of patients with 13q deletion presented hsa-miR-16-1-3p levels below the median value in normal samples (P < 0.05). Finally, although no correlation was found between the expression of each miRNA and other clinicopathological features (Ki67, CD38, ZAP70, and IGVH@ hypermutations), the OS curves showed a positive trend in patients with miRNAs downregulation, though not statistically significant. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that all miRNAs can be successfully studied in FFPE CLL tissues and that del13q and PCs richness do not strictly correspond to miRNAs downregulation; therefore, a specific evaluation may be envisaged at least in patients enrolled in clinical trials.","['Rossi, Maura', 'Fuligni, Fabio', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Righi, Simona', 'Luciani, Marco', 'Laginestra, Maria Antonella', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Sapienza, Maria Rosaria', 'Gazzola, Anna', 'Mannu, Claudia', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo']","['Rossi M', 'Fuligni F', 'Ciccone M', 'Agostinelli C', 'Righi S', 'Luciani M', 'Laginestra MA', 'Rigolin GM', 'Sapienza MR', 'Gazzola A', 'Mannu C', 'Cuneo A', 'Pileri S', 'Piccaluga PP']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, Bologna University Medical School, Unit of Hematopathology, S.

In regular culture conditions, ESCs' self-renewal is maintained through molecules that inhibit spontaneous differentiation enabling long-term cellular expansion. This undifferentiating condition is characterized by multiple metastable states that fluctuate between self-renewal and differentiation balance. Here, we aim to characterize the high-pluripotent ESC metastate marked by the expression of Zscan4 through a supervised machine learning framework based on an ensemble of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Our study revealed a leukaemia inhibitor factor (Lif) dependent not-canonical pluripotency signature (AF067063, BC061212, Dub1, Eif1a, Gm12794, Gm13871, Gm4340, Gm4850, Tcstv1/3, and Zfp352), that specifically marks Zscan4 ESCs' fluctuation. This novel ESC metastate is enhanced by high-pluripotency culture conditions obtained through Extracellular signal Regulated-Kinase (ERK) and Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) signaling inhibition (2i). Significantly, we reported that the conditional ablation of the novel ESC metastate marked by the expression of Gm12794 is required for ESCs self-renewal maintenance. In conclusion, we extend the comprehension of ESCs biology through the identification of a novel molecular signature associated to pluripotency programming.","['Cerulo, Luigi', 'Tagliaferri, Daniela', 'Marotta, Pina', 'Zoppoli, Pietro', 'Russo, Filomena', 'Mazio, Claudia', 'DeFelice, Mario', 'Ceccarelli, Michele', 'Falco, Geppino']","['Cerulo L', 'Tagliaferri D', 'Marotta P', 'Zoppoli P', 'Russo F', 'Mazio C', 'DeFelice M', 'Ceccarelli M', 'Falco G']","['Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy ; Department of Science, Universita degli Studi del Sannio, Benevento, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy ; Department of Science, Universita degli Studi del Sannio, Benevento, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy ; Department of Medicina Molecolare e Biotecnologie mediche, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy ; Department of Science, Universita degli Studi del Sannio, Benevento, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Development, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche Gaetano Salvatore Biogem scarl, Ariano Irpino, Italy ; Department of Science, Universita degli Studi del Sannio, Benevento, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcriptome']",PMC3879232,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0083235 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-26834 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jan 2;9(1):e83235. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0083235. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mechanism can be exploited to make the reverse transcriptase switch template from the RNA molecule to a secondary oligonucleotide during first-strand cDNA synthesis, and thereby to introduce arbitrary barcode or adaptor sequences in the cDNA. Because the mechanism is relatively efficient and occurs in a single reaction, it has recently found use in several protocols for single-cell RNA sequencing. However, the base preference of the terminal transferase activity is not known in detail, which may lead to inefficiencies in template switching when starting from tiny amounts of mRNA. Here, we used fully degenerate oligos to determine the exact base preference at the template switching site up to a distance of ten nucleotides. We found a strong preference for guanosine at the first non-templated nucleotide, with a greatly reduced bias at progressively more distant positions. Based on this result, and a number of careful optimizations, we report conditions for efficient template switching for cDNA amplification from single cells.","['Zajac, Pawel', 'Islam, Saiful', 'Hochgerner, Hannah', 'Lonnerberg, Peter', 'Linnarsson, Sten']","['Zajac P', 'Islam S', 'Hochgerner H', 'Lonnerberg P', 'Linnarsson S']","['Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131231,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/*metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Regression Analysis', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Templates, Genetic']",PMC3877366,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085270 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-31287 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 31;8(12):e85270. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085270. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, many studies have examined the association between CYP1A1 MspI and Ile462Val polymorphisms and cancer risk in various populations, but their results have been conflicting rather than consistent. METHODS: To assess this relationship more precisely, a meta-analysis based on 198 publications was performed. Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association. The statistical heterogeneity across studies was examined with a chi-square-based Q-test. RESULTS: Overall, a significant elevated risk of cancer was associated with CYP1A1 MspI and Ile462Val polymorphisms for all genetic models studied. Further stratified analysis by cancer types revealed that the MspI polymorphism may increase the risk of lung cancer and cervical cancer whereas the Ile462Val polymorphism may contribute to a higher risk of lung cancer, leukemia, esophageal carcinoma, and prostate cancer. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, obvious associations were found in the Asian population for the MspI polymorphism while an increased risk of cancer was observed in Asians and Caucasians for the Ile462Val polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CYP1A1 MspI and Ile462Val polymorphisms contribute to increased cancer susceptibility among Asians. Additional comprehensive system analyses are required to validate this association and other related polymorphisms.","['Wu, Bin', 'Liu, Kang', 'Huang, Huaxing', 'Yuan, Jun', 'Yuan, Wanqing', 'Wang, Shangqian', 'Chen, Tingting', 'Zhao, Hu', 'Yin, Changjun']","['Wu B', 'Liu K', 'Huang H', 'Yuan J', 'Yuan W', 'Wang S', 'Chen T', 'Zhao H', 'Yin C']","['Department of Urology, The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, Wuxi, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, Wuxi, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, Wuxi, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20131231,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HpaII)']",IM,"['Asians/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease HpaII/metabolism', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",PMC3877352,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0085166 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-22189 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 31;8(12):e85166. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085166. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune related functions regulated by SP-D include agglutination of pathogens, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, antigen presentation, T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion, induction of apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells. The present study unravels a novel ability of SP-D to reduce the viability of leukemic cells (eosinophilic leukemic cell line, AML14.3D10; acute myeloid leukemia cell line, THP-1; acute lymphoid leukemia cell lines, Jurkat, Raji; and human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-7), and explains the underlying mechanisms. SP-D and a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rhSP-D) induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and dose and time-dependent apoptosis in the AML14.3D10 eosinophilic leukemia cell line. Levels of various apoptotic markers viz. activated p53, cleaved caspase-9 and PARP, along with G2/M checkpoints (p21 and Tyr15 phosphorylation of cdc2) showed significant increase in these cells. We further attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of rhSP-D induced apoptosis using proteomic analysis. This approach identified large scale molecular changes initiated by SP-D in a human cell for the first time. Among others, the proteomics analysis highlighted a decreased expression of survival related proteins such as HMGA1, overexpression of proteins to protect the cells from oxidative burst, while a drastic decrease in mitochondrial antioxidant defense system. rhSP-D mediated enhanced oxidative burst in AML14.3D10 cells was confirmed, while antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, abrogated the rhSP-D induced apoptosis. The rhSP-D mediated reduced viability was specific to the cancer cell lines and viability of human PBMCs from healthy controls was not affected. The study suggests involvement of SP-D in host's immunosurveillance and therapeutic potential of rhSP-D in the eosinophilic leukemia and cancers of other origins.","['Mahajan, Lakshna', 'Pandit, Hrishikesh', 'Madan, Taruna', 'Gautam, Poonam', 'Yadav, Ajit K', 'Warke, Himangi', 'Sundaram, Curam S', 'Sirdeshmukh, Ravi', 'Sarma, P Usha', 'Kishore, Uday', 'Surolia, Avadhesha']","['Mahajan L', 'Pandit H', 'Madan T', 'Gautam P', 'Yadav AK', 'Warke H', 'Sundaram CS', 'Sirdeshmukh R', 'Sarma PU', 'Kishore U', 'Surolia A']","['Molecular Biochemistry and Diagnostics, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, Delhi, India ; Centre for Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Immunology (NII), New Delhi, India.', 'Innate Immunity, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Molecular Biochemistry and Diagnostics, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, Delhi, India ; Innate Immunity, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Molecular Biochemistry and Diagnostics, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, Delhi, India ; Proteomics Research Facility, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Innate Immunity, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, K E M Hospital and Seth G.

Here we analyzed the expressions of mitochondrial ATPsyn-beta in adriamycin-resistant cell line HL-60/ADM and its parental cell line HL-60. Meanwhile we compared the differences of mitochondrial ATPsyn-beta expression and ATP synthase activity in 110 acute myeloid leukemia (AML, non-M3) patients between relapsed/refractory and those in remission. Our results showed that down-regulation of ATPsyn-beta expression by siRNA in HL-60 cells increased cell viability and apoptotic resistance to adriamycin, while up-regulation of mitochondrial ATPsyn-beta in HL-60/ADM cells enhanced cell sensitivity to adriamycin and promoted apoptosis. Mitochondrial ATPsyn-beta expression and ATP synthase activity in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients were downregulated. This downregulated ATPsyn-beta expression exhibited a positive correlation with the response to adriamycin of primary cells. A lower expression of ATPsyn-beta in newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory patients was associated with a shorter first remission duration or overall survival. Our findings show mitochondrial ATPsyn-beta plays an important role in the mechanism of multidrug resistance in AML thus may present both a new marker for prognosis assessment and a new target for reversing drug resistance.","['Xiao, Xiang', 'Yang, Jingke', 'Li, Ruijuan', 'Liu, Sufang', 'Xu, Yunxiao', 'Zheng, Wenli', 'Yi, Yan', 'Luo, Yunya', 'Gong, Fanjie', 'Peng, Honglin', 'Pei, Minfei', 'Deng, Mingyang', 'Zhang, Guangsen']","['Xiao X', 'Yang J', 'Li R', 'Liu S', 'Xu Y', 'Zheng W', 'Yi Y', 'Luo Y', 'Gong F', 'Peng H', 'Pei M', 'Deng M', 'Zhang G']","['Division of Hematology, Institution of Molecular Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.

To date, the potential miRNAs regulating osteosarcoma growth and progression are not fully identified yet. In this study, the miRNA microarray assay and hierarchical clustering analysis were performed in human osteosarcoma samples. In comparison with normal human skeletal muscle, 43 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in human osteosarcomas (fold change >/=2 and p</=0.05). Among these miRNAs, miR-133a and miR-133b expression was decreased by 135 folds and 47 folds respectively and the decreased expression was confirmed in both frozen and paraffin-embedded osteosarcoma samples. The miR-133b precursor expression vector was then transfected into osteosarcoma cell lines U2-OS and MG-63, and the stable transfectants were selected by puromycin. We found that stable over-expression of miR-133b in osteosarcoma cell lines U2-OS and MG-63 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and induced apoptosis. Further, over-expression of miR-133b decreased the expression of predicted target genes BCL2L2, MCL-1, IGF1R and MET, as well as the expression of phospho-Akt and FAK. This study provides a new insight into miRNAs dysregulation in osteosarcoma, and indicates that miR-133b may play as a tumor suppressor gene in osteosarcoma.","['Zhao, Huafu', 'Li, Mei', 'Li, Lihua', 'Yang, Xiaoming', 'Lan, Guobo', 'Zhang, Yu']","['Zhao H', 'Li M', 'Li L', 'Yang X', 'Lan G', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Medical Research, Liu Hua Qiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Liu Hua Qiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Liu Hua Qiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Liu Hua Qiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Liu Hua Qiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Liu Hua Qiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131231,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN133 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC3877051,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/08/26 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0083571 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30938 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 31;8(12):e83571. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0083571. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cells are thought to contribute to the process of tumor killing by certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) by directing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through FcgammaRIIIA (CD16). Numerous therapeutic mAb have been developed that target distinct cancer-specific cell markers and may direct NK cell-mediated ADCC. Recent therapeutic approaches have combined some of these cancer-specific mAb with additional strategies to optimize NK cell cytotoxicity. These include agonistic mAb targeting NK cell activating receptors and mAbs blocking NK cell inhibitory receptors to enhance NK cell functions. Furthermore, several drugs that can potentiate NK cell cytotoxicity through other mechanisms are being used in combination with therapeutic mAb. In this review, we examine the mechanisms employed by several promising agents used in combination therapies that enhance natural or Ab-dependent cytotoxicity of cancer cells by NK cells, with a focus on treatments for leukemia and multiple myeloma.","['Mentlik James, Ashley', 'Cohen, Adam D', 'Campbell, Kerry S']","['Mentlik James A', 'Cohen AD', 'Campbell KS']","['Immune Cell Development and Host Defense Program, The Research Institute at Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia, PA , USA.', 'Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, PA , USA.', 'Immune Cell Development and Host Defense Program, The Research Institute at Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia, PA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131223,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC3870292,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/01/07 06:01,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2013.00481 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2013 Dec 23;4:481. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00481.,,,,"['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'NK cells', 'antibodies', 'immunotherapy of cancer', 'monoclonal', 'multiple myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we report that Abs against (1-->6)-beta-d-glucan, a typical microbial PAMP and a major target for high titer circulating natural Abs in healthy human subjects, cross-recognize a novel tumor-associated carbohydrate Ag on cancer cells. The (1-->6)-beta-glucan cross-reactive moiety is immunologically dominant in tumor cells, as C57BL/6 mice harboring EL-4 solid tumors produced anti-(1-->6)-beta-glucan Abs and the titer of which significantly correlated with enhanced survival and smaller tumor burden. Moreover, the (1-->6)-beta-glucan-specific Abs exhibited potent tumoricidal activities in vitro. C57BL/6 mice immunized with Candida albicans produced protective immunity against inoculated EL-4 tumors, which was attributed to the formation of (1-->6)-beta-glucan-specific Abs. Importantly, (1-->6)-beta-glucan-specific Abs significantly prolonged the survival and reduced the tumor size in mice inoculated with EL-4 tumors. Our results demonstrate that the (1-->6)-beta-glucan cross-reactive moiety represents a focal point between infection immunity and cancer surveillance, and natural Abs against this epitope may contribute to the first-line antitumor surveillance in humans.

The transcription factor MEF2D promotes survival in various cell types and it seems to function as an oncogene in leukemia. However, its potential contributions to solid cancers have not been explored. In this study, we investigated MEF2D expression and function in hepatocellular carcinoma, finding that MEF2D elevation in hepatocellular carcinoma clinical specimens was associated with poor prognosis. MEF2D-positive primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells displayed a faster proliferation rate compared with MEF2D-negative cells, and silencing or promoting MEF2D expression in these settings limited or accelerated cell proliferation, respectively. Notably, MEF2D-silencing abolished hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenicity in mouse xenograft models. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MEF2D-silencing triggered G2-M arrest in a manner associated with direct downregulation of the cell-cycle regulatory genes RPRM, GADD45A, GADD45B, and CDKN1A. Furthermore, we identified MEF2D as an authentic target of miR-122, the reduced expression of which in hepatocellular carcinoma may be responsible for MEF2D upregulation.

Idelalisib (CAL-101, GS-1101) and IPI-145 (INK-1147) are novel oral PI3K-delta inhibitors in development, with rates of objective response of 40-60 % and nodal responses exceeding 70 % in relapsed and refractory CLL. High rates of response have been seen in high-risk CLL (i.e., 17p and 11q deletions), and may allow for more effective therapy in inherently chemotherapy-resistant disease. Combination chemotherapy regimens with idelalisib have similarly demonstrated favorable tolerability and activity.

Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the BCR-ABL1 oncokinase, patients are not considered to be cured with the current therapy modalities. However, there have been recent advancements in understanding the immunobiology of the disease (such as tumor specific antigens and immunostimulatory agents), and this may lead to the development of novel, curative treatment strategies. Already there are promising results showing that a small proportion of CML patients are able to discontinue the therapy although they have a minimal amount of residual leukemia cells left. This implies that the immune system is able to restrain the tumor cell expansion. In this review, we aim to give a brief update of the novel aspects of the immune system in CML patients and of the developing strategies for controlling CML by the means of immunotherapy.","['Ilander, Mette', 'Hekim, Can', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Ilander M', 'Hekim C', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, mette.ilander@helsinki.fi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/immunology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-013-0190-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2014 Mar;9(1):17-23. doi: 10.1007/s11899-013-0190-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells show metabolic characteristics resembling deviations observed in TKTL1 overexpressing solid tumour cells. We therefore sought to evaluate TKTL1 gene expression in different phases of CML. METHODS: A total of 120 peripheral blood samples from 69 patients in various phases of CML and 21 healthy individuals were investigated. TKTL1 expression levels were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction using LightCycler technology and normalised against beta-glucuronidase expression. RESULTS: A significantly lower TKTL1 expression was found in chronic phase (CP) CML patients compared to healthy controls. Lowest expression levels were observed in patients during blast crisis (BC). Baseline TKTL1 expression in CP patients did not have value in prognostication of subsequent favourable or dismal outcome. Further, more mature granulocytes showed significantly higher TKTL1 expression compared to immature CD34+ and CD34-/CD33+ cells both in healthy controls and in CML patients. CONCLUSION: TKTL1 expression levels appear to decline in the course of CML with lowest levels during BC. A potential reason is a shift of TKTL1-high-expressing mature granulocytes towards TKTL1-low-expressing immature cells and blasts.","['Philipp, M', 'Schwaab, J', 'Dietz, C T', 'Hanfstein, B', 'Kalmanti, L', 'Munjal, U', 'Mossner, M', 'Nowak, D', 'Seifarth, W', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Muller, M C', 'Erben, P']","['Philipp M', 'Schwaab J', 'Dietz CT', 'Hanfstein B', 'Kalmanti L', 'Munjal U', 'Mossner M', 'Nowak D', 'Seifarth W', 'Hofmann WK', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller MC', 'Erben P']","['III.

Three new research markers, myxovirus A (MxA), CLA/CD162, and CD303/BDCA-2, have been reported to be positive in BPDCN, but their clinical utility has never been tested. We compared these markers to other antibodies that have been used traditionally to distinguish MS from BPDCN to assess the utility of these newer antibodies in differential diagnosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 23 MS and 17 BPDCN cases were assessed using immunohistochemical analysis for CD4, CD14, CD33, CD43, CD56, CD68, CD123, CD163, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL-1), MxA, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA)/CD162, and blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2)/CD303. We identified antibodies with a high predictive value of >/= 90% and used these markers to develop an approach to classification using specific staining criteria. Diagnostic classification criteria were based on staining patterns of one or more of the seven markers. BPDCN was associated with positive staining for CD56, TdT, or TCL1, or negative staining for lysozyme. MS was associated with positive staining for lysozyme or myeloperoxidase, or negative staining for CD56, CD123, myxovirus, or TCL1. The immunohistochemical staining patterns observed using a panel that includes MPO, CD56, CD123, TCL1, TdT, and MxA, are predictive of MS or BPDCN. In this study, neither CD162 nor CD303 had good predictive value in distinguishing MS from BPDCN.","['Sangle, Nikhil A', 'Schmidt, Robert L', 'Patel, Jay L', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Agarwal, Archana M', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Salama, Mohamed E']","['Sangle NA', 'Schmidt RL', 'Patel JL', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Agarwal AM', 'Perkins SL', 'Salama ME']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140103,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2013238 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2013.238 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2014 Aug;27(8):1137-43. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2013.238.

Crew members are also exposed to other physical risk factors and subject to potential disruption of circadian rhythms. METHODS: This study analyses mortality in a pooled cohort of 93 771 crew members from 10 countries. The cohort was followed for a mean of 21.7 years (2.0 million person-years), during which 5508 deaths occurred. RESULTS: The overall mortality was strongly reduced in male cockpit (SMR 0.56) and female cabin crews (SMR 0.73). The mortality from radiation-related cancers was also reduced in male cockpit crew (SMR 0.73), but not in female or male cabin crews (SMR 1.01 and 1.00, respectively). The mortality from female breast cancer (SMR 1.06), leukaemia and brain cancer was similar to that of the general population. The mortality from malignant melanoma was elevated, and significantly so in male cockpit crew (SMR 1.57). The mortality from cardiovascular diseases was strongly reduced (SMR 0.46). On the other hand, the mortality from aircraft accidents was exceedingly high (SMR 33.9), as was that from AIDS in male cabin crew (SMR 14.0). CONCLUSIONS: This large study with highly complete follow-up shows a reduced overall mortality in male cockpit and female cabin crews, an increased mortality of aircraft accidents and an increased mortality in malignant skin melanoma in cockpit crew.

However, difficulty in conducting high-throughput NAMPT assay with good sensitivity has hampered the discovery of novel anti-NAMPT drugs with improved profiles. We combined an in silico screening strategy with a radioisotope (RI)-based enzyme assay and rationally identified promising NAMPT inhibitors with novel structures. AS1604498 was the most potent inhibitor, with an IC50 of 44 nM, and inhibited THP-1 and K562 cell line growth with the IC50 of 198 nM and 673 nM, respectively. The mode of action was found to reduce intracellular NAD following apoptosis, suggesting that these compounds inhibit NAMPT in cell-based assay.

Results from differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies indicated that within the terpolymer structure, the PCL segments are in the crystalline state, while fluorocarbon segments belong to the amorphous domains. Due to the thermodynamic incompatibility of PCL and PPFEMA, MCMs could be obtained upon aqueous self-assembly of the terpolymer. The well-segregated Janus-cores with adjustable compartment balance were revealed by transmission electron microscopy. In vitro cell viability assays further demonstrated an excellent cytocompatibility of the MCMs both in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (3T3) and human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells.","['Wang, Weiwei', 'Zhang, Ju', 'Li, Chen', 'Huang, Pingsheng', 'Gao, Shan', 'Han, Shangcong', 'Dong, Anjie', 'Kong, Deling']","['Wang W', 'Zhang J', 'Li C', 'Huang P', 'Gao S', 'Han S', 'Dong A', 'Kong D']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin 300192, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin 300192, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin 300192, China.', 'School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin 300192, China.', 'School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.', 'School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently the only potentially curative treatment for advanced polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. We analyzed 250 consecutive patients with an initial diagnosis of polycythemia vera (n=120) or essential thrombocythemia (n=130), who underwent transplantation due to progression to myelofibrosis (n=193) or acute myeloid leukemia (n=57) and who were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry between 1994 and 2010. Their median age was 56 years (range, 22-75) and in 52% of cases the interval between diagnosis and transplantation was 10 years or more. With a median follow-up from transplantation of 13 months, the 3-year overall survival rate and relapse incidence were 55% and 32%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the main parameters that negatively affected post-transplantation outcomes were older age (>55 years), a diagnosis at transplant of acute myeloid leukemia and the use of an unrelated donor. The overall 3-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 28%, but was significantly higher in older patients than in younger ones (>55 years, 35% versus 20%, P=0.032), in those transplanted from an unrelated donor rather than a related donor (34% versus 18%, P=0.034) and in patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia compared to myelofibrosis (29% versus 27%, P=0.045). This large retrospective study confirms that transplantation is potentially curative for patients with end-stage polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia progressing to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia. Relapse and non-relapse mortality remain unsolved problems for which innovative treatment approaches need to be assessed.","['Lussana, Federico', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Finazzi, Maria Chiara', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Scholten, Marijke', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Carobbio, Alessandra', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Lussana F', 'Rambaldi A', 'Finazzi MC', 'van Biezen A', 'Scholten M', 'Oldani E', 'Carobbio A', 'Iacobelli S', 'Finke J', 'Nagler A', 'Volin L', 'Lamy T', 'Arnold R', 'Mohty M', 'Michallet M', 'de Witte T', 'Olavarria E', 'Kroger N']",['arambaldi@hpg23.it.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140103,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4008110,2014/01/07 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.094284 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.094284 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 May;99(5):916-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.094284.

Asparaginases are a class of enzymatic anti-leukemia agents that induce apoptosis in leukemia cell lines; however, the role of L-asparaginase in the induction of apoptosis in AML cells has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the apoptosis-inducing effect of L-asparaginase and its underlying mechanism in AML U937 cells. The results showed that L-asparaginase significantly inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the low baseline expression level of asparaginase synthase (ASNS) demonstrated the sensitivity of U937 cells and AML M5, a rare subtype of AML, to L-asparaginase. Apoptosis induced by L-asparaginase is mediated by apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Our findings show the potential of L-asparaginase as an effective approach in treating AML via the induction of apoptosis mediated by AIF.","['He, Yingyi', 'Li, Benshang', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Luo, Changying', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Chen, Jing', 'Gu, Longjun']","['He Y', 'Li B', 'Zhang H', 'Luo C', 'Shen S', 'Tang J', 'Chen J', 'Gu L']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical College,Guangzhou, 510623, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of , Children's Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200040, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*physiology', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'U937 Cells']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['4222 [pii]', '10.2741/4222 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2014 Jan 1;19:515-27. doi: 10.2741/4222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic abnormalities in a progenitor cells is thought to lead to uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells. In addition, in the last years, it has been clearly recognized that the hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AML. The HM can regulate hematopoiesis by interacting directly with HC and/or by secreting regulatory molecules that exert a positive or negative influence on the growth of HC. Stromal elements are important in the homing of immature HC or hematopoietic stem cells. Several studies propose that important quantitative and functional alterations are present in the BMSC of AML patients. AML may arise in the setting of an abnormal HM, resulting in the generation of multiple populations with varying initiation event. Dysfunction of HM may contribute to leukemia by supplying abundant growth factors that promote proliferation and/or inhibit apoptosis. Recent discoveries utilizing mouse models showed that genetic alteration in cells of HM can induce AML.","['Blau, Olga']",['Blau O'],"['Charite University School of Medicine, Labor Berlin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,,IM,"['Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['4203 [pii]', '10.2741/4203 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2014 Jan 1;19:171-80. doi: 10.2741/4203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease models considered were myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CD38 has been analyzed considering its twin function as receptor and enzyme, roles usually not considered in clinics, where it is used as a routine marker. Another aspect pertaining basic science concerns the role of the molecule as a member of an ectoenzyme network, potentially metabolizing soluble factors not yet analyzed (e.g., NAD+, ATP, NAM) or influencing hormone secretion (e.g., oxytocin). The last point is focused on the use of CD38 as a target of an antibody-mediated therapeutic approach in myeloma and CLL. A recent observation is that CD38 may run an escape circuit leading to the production of adenosine. The generation of local anergy may be blocked by using anti-CD38 antibodies. Consequently, not only might CD38 be a prime target for mAb-mediated therapy, but its functional block may contribute to general improvement in cancer immunotherapy and outcomes.","['Chillemi, Antonella', 'Zaccarello, Gianluca', 'Quarona, Valeria', 'Lazzaretti, Mirca', 'Martella, Eugenia', 'Giuliani, Nicola', 'Ferracini, Riccardo', 'Pistoia, Vito', 'Horenstein, Alberto L', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Chillemi A', 'Zaccarello G', 'Quarona V', 'Lazzaretti M', 'Martella E', 'Giuliani N', 'Ferracini R', 'Pistoia V', 'Horenstein AL', 'Malavasi F']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino Medical School, Via Santena 19, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino Medical School, Via Santena 19, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino Medical School, Via Santena 19, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Bioscences, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Anatomia e Istologia patologica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Center, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Citta della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Torino, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, Department of Experimental and Laboratory Medicine, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino Medical School, Via Santena 19, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino Medical School, Via Santena 19, 10126 Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,['EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)'],IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['4201 [pii]', '10.2741/4201 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2014 Jan 1;19:152-62. doi: 10.2741/4201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This targeting strategy does not affect other mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family histone methyltransferases (HMTs), revealing a unique regulatory feature for the MLL1 complex. Using MM-401 and its enantiomer control MM-NC-401, we show that inhibiting MLL1 methyltransferase activity specifically blocks proliferation of MLL cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and myeloid differentiation without general toxicity to normal bone marrow cells or non-MLL cells. More importantly, transcriptome analyses show that MM-401 induces changes in gene expression similar to those of MLL1 deletion, supporting a predominant role of MLL1 activity in regulating MLL1-dependent leukemia transcription program.

The HTLV-1 regulatory protein Tax aggressively accelerates the proliferation of host cells and is also an important target antigen for CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). We previously reported that several predominant HLA-A*24:02-restricted HTLV-1 Tax301-309-specific CTL clones commonly expressed a particular amino acid sequence motif (P-D-R) in complementarity-determining region 3 of T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain among unrelated ATL patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Furthermore, a PDR-motif(+) CTL clone persistently existed in a long-term survivor as a central CTL clone with strong CTL activities after HSCT. Although a larger analysis of the relationship between PDR-motif(+) CTLs and the clinical course is required, the expression of PDR-motif(+) TCR on CD8(+) T cells may play a critical role in the management of anti-HTLV-1 activities for HLA-A24:02(+) ATL patients. Therefore, in this study, we prepared an HTLV-1 Tax301-309 peptide-specific CTL clone (HT-9) expressing PDR-motif(+) TCR isolated from a long-term survivor after HSCT, and evaluated its CTL activity against a variety of HTLV-1-infected T-cells from HLA-A*24:02(+) ATL patients. Before the assay of CTL function, we confirmed that HT-9 expressed less-differentiated effector-memory phenotypes (CD45RA(-)CCR7(-)CD27(+)CD28(+/-)CD57(+/-)) and T-cell exhaustion marker PD-1(+). In assays of CTL function, HT-9 recognized HTLV-1 Tax in an HLA-restricted fashion and demonstrated strong CTL activities against a variety of HTLV-1-infected T-cells from HLA-A*24:02(+) ATL patients regardless of whether the sources were autologous or allogeneic, but not normal cells. These data indicate that PDR-motif(+) TCR could be an important TCR candidate for TCR-gene immunotherapy for HLA-A24:02(+) ATL patients, provided that the CTL activities against HTLV-1 are reproduced in in vivo experiments using mouse models.","['Tanaka, Yukie', 'Yamazaki, Rie', 'Terasako-Saito, Kiriko', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Akahoshi, Yu', 'Nakano, Hirofumi', 'Ugai, Tomotaka', 'Wada, Hidenori', 'Yamasaki, Ryoko', 'Ishihara, Yuko', 'Kawamura, Koji', 'Sakamoto, Kana', 'Ashizawa, Masahiro', 'Sato, Miki', 'Kimura, Shun-ichi', 'Kikuchi, Misato', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Tanihara, Aki', 'Nishida, Junji', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Tanaka Y', 'Yamazaki R', 'Terasako-Saito K', 'Nakasone H', 'Akahoshi Y', 'Nakano H', 'Ugai T', 'Wada H', 'Yamasaki R', 'Ishihara Y', 'Kawamura K', 'Sakamoto K', 'Ashizawa M', 'Sato M', 'Kimura S', 'Kikuchi M', 'Kako S', 'Kanda J', 'Tanihara A', 'Nishida J', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.

METHODS: The literature was searched by PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science (SCI) and Medline databases during 1997-2013. Heterogeneity in several studies was weighted by I-squared value. Publication bias was tested by funnel plot and Egger's test. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were used to evaluate the association strength. The statistical analyses in present study were carried out by STATA software package (version 12.0, College Station, TX). RESULTS: A total of 11,699 cases and 13,194 controls in 9 studies were stratified by different exposure cut-off points. On condition of the reference <0.1 muT, statistical association between magnetic field intensity >/=0.4 muT and childhood leukemia was exhibited (for total leukemia: OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.03-2.40; for acute lymphocytic leukemia: OR=2.43, 95% CI = 1.30-4.55). On condition of the reference level of <0.2 muT, the positive association between magnetic field intensity >/=0.2 muT and childhood leukemia was found (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06-1.61). CONCLUSIONS: The result in this meta-analysis indicated that magnetic field exposure level may be associated with childhood leukemia.","['Zhao, Longyu', 'Liu, Xiaodong', 'Wang, Chunpeng', 'Yan, Kangkang', 'Lin, Xuejun', 'Li, Shuang', 'Bao, Honghong', 'Liu, Xin']","['Zhao L', 'Liu X', 'Wang C', 'Yan K', 'Lin X', 'Li S', 'Bao H', 'Liu X']","['Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Radiobiology (Ministry of Health), School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Mathematics and Statistics, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.

However, the mechanism remains largely unclear. METHODS: Lung cancer cells were treated with parthenolide and the cell lysates were prepared to detect the given proteins by Western Blot analysis, and the cell survival was assayed by SRB and MTT assay. Cell cycle was evaluated by DNA flow cytometry analysis. TNFRSF10B, PMAIP1, ATF4 and DDIT3 genes were knocked down by siRNA technique. Apoptosis was evaluated by using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Parthenolide (PTL) induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human lung cancer cells. Moreover, PTL treatment in NSCLC cells increases expression of TNFRSF10B/DR5 and PMAIP1/NOXA. Silencing of TNFRSF10B or PMAIP1 or overexpression of CFLAR /c-FLIP (long form) could protect cells from PTL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PTL could increase the levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress hallmarks such as ERN1, HSPA5, p-EIF2A, ATF4 and DDIT3. Knockdown of ATF4 and DDIT3 abrogated PTL-induced apoptosis, which suggested that PTL induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells through activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. More importantly, we found that ATF4, DDIT3, TNFRSF10B and PMAIP1 were up-regulated more intensively, while CFLAR and MCL1 were down-regulated more dramatically by PTL in A549/shCDH1 cells than that in control cells, suggesting that PTL preferred to kill cancer stem cell-like cells by activating more intensive ER stress response in cancer stem cell-like cells. CONCLUSION: We showed that parthenolide not only triggered extrinsic apoptosis by up-regulating TNFRSF10B and down-regulating CFLAR, but also induced intrinsic apoptosis through increasing the expression of PMAIP1 and decreasing the level of MCL1 in NSCLC cells. In addition, parthenolide triggered stronger ER stress response in cancer stem cell-like cells which leads to its preference in apoptotic induction. In summary, PTL induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress response.","['Zhao, Xiaofei', 'Liu, Xiangguo', 'Su, Ling']","['Zhao X', 'Liu X', 'Su L']","['Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Cells and Developmental Biology, School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Room 103, South Building, 27 Shanda South RD, Jinan 250100, P,R, China. suling@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140106,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC3892099,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-33-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-33-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Jan 6;33:3. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-33-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically revolutionized and improved CML therapy. However, TKI-based therapy faces a major challenge: the insensitivity of CML leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to TKIs. In particular, while CML progenitor cells and differentiated cells are oncogene addicted, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is dispensable for CML LSC survival and maintenance. Notably, in CML, additional cellular mechanisms promote LSC survival and maintenance, rendering these cells able to survive even in the presence of TKI and to eventually promote relapse. AREAS COVERED: This review will focus on the mechanisms of LSC insensitivity to TKI and on the strategies to obtain synthetic lethality with combination therapies. EXPERT OPINION: Several pathways have been proposed to promote LSC maintenance and described as ideal targets to induce CML LSC exhaustion in combination with TKI. Ongoing clinical trials designed to target some of these pathways will assess which molecular target is relevant for in vivo human LSC survival in a new 'stem-cell targeting' perspective.","['Morotti, Alessandro', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Morotti A', 'Panuzzo C', 'Fava C', 'Saglio G']","['University Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Oncology , Orbassano - Turin , Italy giuseppe.saglio@unito.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140103,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.867323 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Mar;14(3):287-99. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.867323.

Synovial fluids from RA were used to measure the LIF concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistory and RT-PCR were used to examine the expression of LIF by synovial cells. LIF mRNA was detected in all cases in RA synovial cells. Although LIF protein was detected only in 20 cases (19%) in RA synovial fluids, LIF concentration in the synovial fluids significantly correlated with the peripheral leukocyte count (P < 0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.01). Moreover, levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8, but not TNF-alpha, were significantly correlated with LIF in the RA synovial fluids. LIF production was promoted by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha stimulation; in contrast, IL-1 ra and IL-4 were found to markedly decrease LIF production by cultured synovial cells. LIF appeared to be a cytokine produced by RA synovium leading to a proinflammatory secretion profile. Moreover, IL-4 and IL-1 ra may represent attenuated activity for reducing the effect of the destruction of joints by LIF.","['Enomoto, Hiroyuki', 'Saito, Seiji', 'Yabe, Hiroshi', 'Toyama, Yoshiaki', 'Tomatu, Taisuke']","['Enomoto H', 'Saito S', 'Yabe H', 'Toyama Y', 'Tomatu T']","[""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University , 10-22 Wakamatsu-cho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-0054 , Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mod Rheumatol,Modern rheumatology,100959226,,,,,2003/06/01 00:00,2003/06/01 00:01,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2003/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/s10165-002-0210-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Rheumatol. 2003 Jun;13(2):121-8. doi: 10.3109/s10165-002-0210-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to study the association of bloodstream signatures to early neurological outcome after stroke, by combining a subpooling of samples strategy with protein array discovery approach. Plasma samples from 36 acute stroke patients (< 4.5 h from onset) were equally pooled within outcome groups: worsening, stability, and improvement (n = 3 pools of four patients each, for each outcome group). These nine pools were screened using a 177 antibodies library, and 35 proteins were found altered regarding outcome classification (p < 0.1). Processes of inflammation, immune response, coagulation, and apoptosis were regulated by these proteins. Ten representative candidates, mainly cytokines and chemokines, were assayed for replication in individual baseline plasma samples from 80 new stroke patients: beta-defensin2, MIP-3b, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 active, beta-cell-attracting chemokine 1, Exodus-2, interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R), IL-12p40, leukemia inhibitor factor, MIP-1b, and tumor necrosis factor-related weak inducer of apoptosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed beta-defensin 2 (ORadj 4.87 [1.13-20.91] p = 0.033) and IL-4R (ORadj 3.52 [1.03-12.08] p = 0.045) as independent predictors of worsening at 24 h after adjustment by clinical variables. Both biomarkers improve the prediction by 19% as compared to clinical information, suggesting a potential role for risk stratification in acute thrombolyzed stroke patients. Early neurological deterioration after stroke is not easily predictable. The use of blood biomarkers might help in decision-making processes regarding this complication. By combining a sub-pooling of samples strategy with protein array discovery approach, we have found two new biomarkers: beta-defensin-2 and interleukin-4 receptor. Both biomarkers improve the prediction of poor-outcome over clinical variables in the acute phase of stroke.","['Garcia-Berrocoso, Teresa', 'Giralt, Dolors', 'Bustamante, Alejandro', 'Llombart, Victor', 'Rubiera, Marta', 'Penalba, Anna', 'Boada, Cristina', 'Espadaler, Marc', 'Molina, Carlos', 'Montaner, Joan']","['Garcia-Berrocoso T', 'Giralt D', 'Bustamante A', 'Llombart V', 'Rubiera M', 'Penalba A', 'Boada C', 'Espadaler M', 'Molina C', 'Montaner J']","[""Neurovascular Research Laboratory, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Research (VHIR), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140211,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DEFB4A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (beta-Defensins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'ROC Curve', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/*blood', 'Recovery of Function', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke/*blood', 'beta-Defensins/*blood']",,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jnc.12649 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2014 May;129(3):463-72. doi: 10.1111/jnc.12649.

In a genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1 (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1. METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. RESULTS: Here we show that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell type associated with benzene-associated leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. We note that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given our findings.","['North, Matthew', 'Shuga, Joe', 'Fromowitz, Michele', 'Loguinov, Alexandre', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Vulpe, Chris D']","['North M', 'Shuga J', 'Fromowitz M', 'Loguinov A', 'Shannon K', 'Zhang L', 'Smith MT', 'Vulpe CD']","['Department of Nutritional Science and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. vulpe@berkeley.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140105,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (IRA2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Smoke)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RAS1 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/chemically induced', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/enzymology/genetics/growth & development', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Smoke/*adverse effects', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3898384,2014/01/07 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/01/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-6 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-6 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jan 5;14:6. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-6.,,,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphisms of SLCO1B1 (rs11045879 and rs4149056) were not correlated with MTX concentrations, adverse events, or disease outcome. Conclusions. Polymorphisms of MTHFR (rs1801131) could be the plausive candidate for prognostic predictor in childhood lymphoid malignancies.","['Fukushima, Hiroko', 'Fukushima, Takashi', 'Sakai, Aiko', 'Suzuki, Ryoko', 'Nakajima-Yamaguchi, Ryoko', 'Kobayashi, Chie', 'Iwabuchi, Atsushi', 'Saito, Makoto', 'Yoshimi, Ai', 'Nakao, Tomohei', 'Kato, Keisuke', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro', 'Takahashi, Hideto', 'Koike, Kazutoshi', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Noguchi, Emiko', 'Sumazaki, Ryo']","['Fukushima H', 'Fukushima T', 'Sakai A', 'Suzuki R', 'Nakajima-Yamaguchi R', 'Kobayashi C', 'Iwabuchi A', 'Saito M', 'Yoshimi A', 'Nakao T', 'Kato K', 'Tsuchida M', 'Takahashi H', 'Koike K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Noguchi E', 'Sumazaki R']","['Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Japan."", 'Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Japan.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131210,United States,Leuk Res Treatment,Leukemia research and treatment,101591812,,,,PMC3872414,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/01/05 06:01,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/238528 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res Treatment. 2013;2013:238528. doi: 10.1155/2013/238528.

Evaluation of cell surface markers using multiparametric flow cytometry is a well adapted qualitative measure of cells in question for many years. An artillery of these markers has been studied in hematological malignancies and related disorders. However, their role and differential expression on normal hematopoietic stem cells from clinically available sources is not always described carefully. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate expression of CD44, CD90, CD96 and CD123 in three clinically available sources of normal HSCs (Hematopoietic stem cells). Sources of HSCs in the present study involved umbilical cord blood (UCB), normal bone marrow (NBM) and bone marrow from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients (IBM). CD44 is an important homing receptor while CD90 is involved in maintaining stem cell quiescent. CD96 is known to be leukemia specific marker and CD123 is involved in stem cell differentiation and survival. We observed a significant difference in expression CD44, CD90 and CD123 on normal HSCs derived from umbilical cord and ITP marrow. CD96 was highly expressed on HSCs obtained from ITP marrow. Investigating expression of these markers on normal HSCs in different niches will be helpful in correlating their function with niche condition and delineating their 'abnormal' expression from the normal.","['Garg, Swati', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha']","['Garg S', 'Madkaikar M', 'Ghosh K']","['National Institute of Immunohaemtology, Mumbai, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohaemtology, Mumbai, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohaemtology, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Int J Stem Cells,International journal of stem cells,101497587,,,,PMC3878206,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/01/05 06:01,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15283/ijsc.2013.6.2.129 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Stem Cells. 2013 Nov;6(2):129-33. doi: 10.15283/ijsc.2013.6.2.129.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD123', 'CD44', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Niche', 'TACTILE', 'Thy-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approaches to remove hypercalcemia and development of nonhypercalcemic agents can lead to the development of vitamin D-based therapies for treatment of various cancers. In this report, in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacy, safety, and details of vitamin D receptor (VDR) interactions of PT19c, a novel nonhypercalcemic vitamin D derived anticancer agent, are described. PT19c was synthesized by bromoacetylation of PTAD-ergocalciferol adduct. Broader growth inhibitory potential of PT19c was evaluated in a panel of chemoresistant breast, renal, ovarian, lung, colon, leukemia, prostate, melanoma, and central nervous system cancers cell line types of NCI60 cell line panel. Interactions of PT19c with VDR were determined by a VDR transactivation assay in a VDR overexpressing VDR-UAS-bla-HEK293 cells, in vitro VDR-coregulator binding, and molecular docking with VDR-ligand binding domain (VDR-LBD) in comparison with calcitriol. Acute toxicity of PT19c was determined in nontumored mice. In vivo antitumor efficacy of PT19c was determined via ovarian and endometrial cancer xenograft experiments. Effect of PT19c on actin filament organization and focal adhesion formation was examined by microscopy. PT19c treatment inhibited growth of chemoresistant NCI60 cell lines (log10GI50 ~ -4.05 to -6.73). PT19c (10 mg/kg, 35 days) reduced growth of ovarian and endometrial xenograft tumor without hypercalcemia. PT19c exerted no acute toxicity up to 400 mg/kg (QDx1) in animals. PT19c showed weak VDR antagonism, lack of VDR binding, and inverted spatial accommodation in VDR-LBD. PT19c caused actin filament dysfunction and inhibited focal adhesion in SKOV-3 cells. PT19c is a VDR independent nonhypercalcemic vitamin D-derived agent that showed noteworthy safety and efficacy in ovarian and endometrial cancer animal models and inhibited actin organization and focal adhesion in ovarian cancer cells.","['Kawar, Nada', 'Maclaughlan, Shannon', 'Horan, Timothy C', 'Uzun, Alper', 'Lange, Thilo S', 'Kim, Kyu K', 'Hopson, Russell', 'Singh, Ajay P', 'Sidhu, Preetpal S', 'Glass, Kyle A', 'Shaw, Sunil', 'Padbury, James F', 'Vorsa, Nicholi', 'Arnold, Leggy A', 'Moore, Richard G', 'Brard, Laurent', 'Singh, Rakesh K']","['Kawar N', 'Maclaughlan S', 'Horan TC', 'Uzun A', 'Lange TS', 'Kim KK', 'Hopson R', 'Singh AP', 'Sidhu PS', 'Glass KA', 'Shaw S', 'Padbury JF', 'Vorsa N', 'Arnold LA', 'Moore RG', 'Brard L', 'Singh RK']","[""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Stanford Women's Cancer Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."", ""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", 'Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Plant Biology and Pathology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", 'Department of Plant Biology and Pathology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', ""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Southern Illinois University, Springfield, IL, USA.', ""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC3877664,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/01/05 06:01,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601913507575 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601913507575 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2013 Nov;4(11-12):524-34. doi: 10.1177/1947601913507575.,,,,['R01 CA136491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['NOTNLM'],"['antitumor efficacy', 'endometrial cancer', 'hypercalcemia', 'ovarian cancer', 'vitamin D']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hERG potassium channel blockage by a new 36-residue scorpion toxin BmKKx2, a potent hERG channel blocker with IC50 of 6.7 +/- 1.7 nM, enhanced the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. The mean values of GPA (CD235a) fluorescence intensity in the group of K562 cells pretreated by the toxin for 24 h and followed by cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) treatment for 72 h were about 2-fold stronger than those of K562 cells induced by Ara-C alone. Such unique role of hERG potassium channel was also supported by the evidence that the effect of the toxin BmKKx2 on cell differentiation was nullified in hERG-deficient cell lines. During the K562 cell differentiation, BmKKx2 could also suppress the expression of hERG channels at both mRNA and protein levels. Besides the function of differentiation enhancement, BmKKx2 was also found to promote the differentiation-dependent apoptosis during the differentiation process of K562 cells. In addition, the blockage of hERG potassium channel by toxin BmKKx2 was able to decrease the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration during the K562 cell differentiation, providing an insight into the mechanism of hERG potassium channel regulating this cellular process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results revealed scorpion toxin BmKKx2 could enhance the erythroid differentiation of leukemic K562 cells via inhibiting hERG potassium channel currents. These findings would not only accelerate the functional research of hERG channel in different leukemic cells, but also present the prospects of natural scorpion toxins as anti-leukemic drugs.","['Ma, Jian', 'Hu, Youtian', 'Guo, Mingxiong', 'Huang, Zan', 'Li, Wenxin', 'Wu, Yingliang']","['Ma J', 'Hu Y', 'Guo M', 'Huang Z', 'Li W', 'Wu Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131226,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (KK toxin, Buthus martensi)', '0 (Scorpion Venoms)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Scorpion Venoms/*pharmacology']",PMC3873423,2014/01/05 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084903 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-35500 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 26;8(12):e84903. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084903. eCollection 2013.,,,,['R21 AA020304/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch signaling is quickly shut down once the cells pass beta-selection, and CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) cells are unresponsive to Notch. Over the past two decades a number of papers reported that over-activation of Notch signaling causes T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a cancer that prominently features circulating monoclonal CD4/CD8 double positive T cells in different mouse models. However, the possible outcomes of Notch over-activation at different stages of T cell development are unknown, and the fine timing of Notch signaling that results in T-ALL is poorly understood. Here we report, by using a murine model that ectopically expresses DLL4 on developing T cells, that the T-ALL onset is highly dependent on a sustained Notch activity throughout the DP stage, which induces additional mutations to further boost the signaling. In contrast, a shorter period of Notch activation that terminates at the DP stage causes a polyclonal, non-transmissible lymphoproliferative disorder that is also lethal. These observations resolved the discrepancy of previous papers on DLL4 driven hematological diseases in mice, and show the critical importance of the timing and duration of Notch activity.","['Xiong, Huizhong', 'Maraver, Antonio', 'Latkowski, Jo-Ann', 'Henderson, Tanya', 'Schlessinger, Karni', 'Ding, Yi', 'Shen, Jie', 'Tadokoro, Carlos E', 'Lafaille, Juan J']","['Xiong H', 'Maraver A', 'Latkowski JA', 'Henderson T', 'Schlessinger K', 'Ding Y', 'Shen J', 'Tadokoro CE', 'Lafaille JJ']","['Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America ; The Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America ; Department of Dermatology, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America ; Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America ; Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131227,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLL4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC3874025,2014/01/05 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084841 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-34164 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 27;8(12):e84841. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084841. eCollection 2013.,,,,"['P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30CA16087-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these individuals, between 0.2% and 1% of them carry chromosomally-integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6). The biological consequences of chromosomal integration by HHV-6 remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the frequency of ciHHV-6 in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to healthy blood donors. METHODOLOGY: A total of 293 DNA samples from children with pre-B (n=255), pre-pre-B (n=4), pre-T (n=26) and undetermined (n=8) leukemia were analyzed for ciHHV-6 by quantitative TaqMan PCR (QPCR) using HHV-6 specific primers and probe. As control, DNA samples from 288 healthy individuals were used. Primers and probe specific to the cellular GAPDH gene were used to estimate integrity and DNA content. RESULTS: Out of 293 DNA samples from the leukemic cohort, 287 contained amplifiable DNA. Of these, only 1 (0.35%) contained ciHHV-6. Variant typing indicates that the ci-HHV-6 corresponds to variant A. None of the 288 DNA samples from healthy individuals contained ciHHV-6. CONCLUSION: The frequency of ciHHV-6 in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is similar (p=0.5) to that of healthy individuals. These results suggest that acute lymphoblastic leukemia does not originate as a consequence to integration of HHV-6 within the chromosomes.","['Gravel, Annie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Flamand, Louis']","['Gravel A', 'Sinnett D', 'Flamand L']","['Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, CHU de Quebec Research Center, Quebec, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie-oncologie, CHU Sainte-Justine, Departement de pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, CHU de Quebec Research Center, Quebec, Canada ; Department of Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Laval University, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131226,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/*virology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*virology', 'Risk Factors', '*Virus Integration']",PMC3873412,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/09/01 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084322 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-37476 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 26;8(12):e84322. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084322. eCollection 2013.,,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cluster analysis is widely used to analyze DNA microarray data to make classification and diagnosis of disease. Because there are so many irrelevant and insignificant genes in a dataset, a feature selection approach must be employed in data analysis. The performance of cluster analysis of this high-throughput data depends on whether the feature selection approach chooses the most relevant genes associated with disease classes. RESULTS: Here we proposed a new method using multiple Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (mOPLS-DA) models and S-plots to select the most relevant genes to conduct three-class disease classification and prediction. We tested our method using Golub's leukemia microarray data. For three classes with subtypes, we proposed hierarchical orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models and S-plots to select features for two main classes and their subtypes. For three classes in parallel, we employed three OPLS-DA models and S-plots to choose marker genes for each class. The power of feature selection to classify and predict three-class disease was evaluated using cluster analysis. Further, the general performance of our method was tested using four public datasets and compared with those of four other feature selection methods.

The objectives of this study are to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of early onset hypertension during the engraftment period after HSCT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 157 consecutive patients (mean age at HSCT: 9.1+/-5.1 years) who underwent HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (n=47), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=43), severe aplastic anemia (n=41), and other reasons (n=26). Blood pressure data were collected at five time points: 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after HSCT. Hypertension was defined as having systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >/=95th percentile according to age, gender, and height. To analyze the risk factors related to hypertension, data, including patients' demographic and transplant characteristics, were reviewed. RESULTS: Hypertension developed in 59 patients (38%), among whom 12 (7.6%) required long term therapy. Thirty-two (54%) patients had systolic and diastolic, 8 (14%) had only systolic, and 19 (32%) had only diastolic hypertension. Younger age, acute graft-versus-host disease, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, treatment with antifungal agent, and greater increase in serum creatinine (Cr) levels were associated with hypertension. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age at HSCT and greater increase in serum Cr level were independent risk factors for hypertension. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of hypertension during immediate post-HSCT period is high, especially in younger children. A greater increase in Cr after HSCT was significantly associated with hypertension. Further study is needed to elucidate long-term cardiovascular complications in pediatric HSCT survivors.","['Kwon, Dae Hyun', 'Jung, Seungwon', 'Lee, Eun-Jung', 'Lee, Jae Young', 'Moon, Sena', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nack Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack Ki']","['Kwon DH', 'Jung S', 'Lee EJ', 'Lee JY', 'Moon S', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131220,Korea (South),Korean Circ J,Korean circulation journal,101247141,,,,PMC3875696,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/01/05 06:01,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4070/kcj.2013.43.12.804 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean Circ J. 2013 Dec;43(12):804-10. doi: 10.4070/kcj.2013.43.12.804.

Favorable chromosomal changes such as t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17) are associated with higher rates of complete remission and event-free survival. Translocation (15;17) characterizes acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (French-American-British class M3) in almost all patients. Secondary chromosomal abnormalities are also present in approximately 23%-29% of patients with newly diagnosed APL. The prognostic implications of t(8;21) and other secondary cytogenetic aberrations in APL are reviewed here. We present a 47-year-old woman diagnosed with APL whose initial cytogenetic analysis included both t(8;21) and t(15;17). The initial induction chemotherapy included 3 days of idarubicin (12 mg/m2/day) and daily all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; 45 mg/m2/day). At the sixth week of treatment, a control bone marrow biopsy was found to be normocellular, t(15;17) bcr3 and t(8;21) were negative, and t(15;17) bcr1 fusion transcripts were reduced from 5007 (1.78525699%) copies per 1 microg RNA to 40 (0.00062020%) with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Consolidation with 4 days of idarubicin (5 mg/m2/day), ATRA (45 mg/m2/day for 15 days), and cytarabine (1 g/m2/day for 4 days) was then started. However, the patient became pancytopenic and had neutropenic fever after consolidation treatment. Unfortunately, she died 3 months after the time of APL diagnosis, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome-like respiratory problems and multiorgan dysfunction requiring respiratory support and hemodialysis.

During therapy, a few patients may develop hematological and non-hematological adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of imatinib therapy in patients with CML. Between December 2007 and October 2009 two hundred patients with CML in chronic phase were included in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to the start of the study. Imatinib was started at 400 mg orally daily. Patients were monitored carefully for any adverse effects. Complete blood count, liver, and renal function tests were done once in 2 weeks during the first month and on a monthly basis during follow-up. Toxicities that encountered were graded as per the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria version 2. Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were managed with short interruptions of treatment and supportive measures, but the daily dose of imatinib was not reduced below 300 mg/day. RESULTS: Two hundred CML patients in chronic phase were included in this study; the male:female ratio was 0.7:1 with mean age 39.06+/-13.21 years (ranged from 15-81 years). The study showed that the commonest hematological side effects were grade 2 anemia (12.5%) followed by leukopenia (8%) and thrombocytopenia (4%), while the most common non-hematological adverse effects were superficial edema and weight gain (51.5%), followed by musculoskeletal pain (35.5%), then gastro-intestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) (19%). Fluid retention was the commonest side effect, which responded to low-dose diuretics. The drug was safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths due to toxicity. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate a well-tolerated drug, and all undesirable effects could be ameliorated easily. The most common hematological and non-hematological side effects were anemia and fluid retention, respectively Conflict of interest:None declared.","['Matti, Bassam Francis', 'Alwan, Alaa Fadhil', 'Alwan, Alaa Fadhil']","['Matti BF', 'Alwan AF', 'Alwan AF']","['Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Clinical Hematology Department, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Clinical Hematology Department, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'National Center of Hematology, Clinical Hematology Department, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131205,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,PMC3874977,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/01/05 06:01,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4274/Tjh.2012.0135 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2013 Dec;30(4):387-93. doi: 10.4274/Tjh.2012.0135.

A Retrospective Cohort Study.,359-65,10.4274/Tjh.2012.0083 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal stem cell disease and is consistently associated with the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The chronic phase of the disease tends to pass into an accelerated phase and eventually leads to acute leukemia if left untreated. Oncoproteins necessary for leukemic transformation are both fundamentally and clinically relevant to identify as they might be new molecular targets for the development of specific anti-leukemic drugs. This study is an initial step to define the proportion of HOXA9 gene expression in some Egyptians with chronic-phase CML at diagnosis and to evaluate its relation with BCR-ABL expression and its clinical significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two newly diagnosed CML patients (56 in chronic phase, 1 in accelerated phase, and 5 in blastic crises) were enrolled in the study. HOXA9 and BCR-ABL gene expressions were detected by one-step RT-PCR. ABL was chosen as a control gene to calculate HOXA9/ABL and BCR-ABL/ABL ratios from densitometric values of PCR product intensities. RESULTS: HOXA9 expression was encountered in 25/56 (44.6%) of newly diagnosed CML patients in the chronic phase. The median expression was 0.31 (range: 0.08-1.37) in relation to the ABL gene, with a higher frequency of expression in CML patients presenting with splenomegaly (p<0.001), high Sokal score (p<0.001), and BCR-ABL expression from the first round (p=0.004). No association could be detected with other clinical parameters, overall survival, or disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: HOXA9 expression is closely related to poor prognostic factors, but we could not demonstrate its relationship to patient survival.

Especially, regular publication and updating of NCCN and ELN guidelines have provided enermous rationale and base for close monitorization of patients with CML. But, it is stil needed to have registry results retrospectively to evaluate daily CML practices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article, we have evaluated 1133 patients' results with CML in terms of demographical features, disease status, response, resistance and use of second-generation TKIs. RESULTS: The response rate has been found relatively high in comparison with previously published articles, and we detected that there was a lack of appropriate and adequate molecular response assessment. CONCLUSION: We concluded that we need to improve registry systems and increase the availability of molecular response assessment to provide high-quality patient care.

Its importance in hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of neuropilin-1 expression in AML patients by both flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in regard to its diagnostic and prognostic values. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates of 44 patients with de novo AML and 12 relapsed AML patients were examined in this study. Ten subjects with nonhematological malignancy serving as the control group were also included. RESULTS: Neuropilin-1 expression by flow cytometry showed a highly significant increase in de novo and relapsed AML patients with a mean of 27.1+/-17.5% and 21.5+/-16.6%, respectively, compared to control group's mean of 3.4+/-1.9%. A cut-off value of 6% was established as differentiating patients from the control group. By real-time PCR, no statistical significance was found in de novo and relapsed AML patients with a mean of 1.9+/-3.6 IU/L and 0.3+/-0.2 IU/L, respectively, compared to the control group's mean of 0.3+/-0.1 IU/L. Neuropilin-1 surface expression by flow cytometry showed a significant correlation with total leukocyte count and a negative correlation with hemoglobin level in de novo AML patients. In relapsed AML patients, positive significant correlations were found with age, bone marrow blast percentage, and CD14. Neuropilin-1 mRNA level by real-time PCR showed a positive significant correlation with peripheral blood blast percentage and CD117 and a negative correlation with hemoglobin level in de novo AML patients. In relapsed patients, a positive correlation was found with lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSION: Neuropilin-1 can be used as a tool for diagnosis and prognosis in AML patients.

The objective of this study is to identify the endocrinological and cardiological late effects of ALL patients treated in our pediatric hematology unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients treated for ALL with BFM protocols after at least 5 years of diagnosis and not relapsed were included in the study. Endocrinological late effects (growth failure, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, thyroid gland disorders, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and pubertal disorders) and cardiological late effects were evaluated. The study group was evaluated with anthropometric measurements, body mass index, and laboratory testing of fasting glucose, insulin, serum lipids, thyroid functions, and bone mineral densities. Echocardiography and pulsed wave Doppler imaging were performed for analysis of cardiac functions. RESULTS: Of the 38 ALL survivors, at least 1 adverse event occurred in 23 (60%), with 8 of them (21%) having multiple problems. Six (16%) of the survivors were obese and 8 (21%) of them were overweight. Subjects who were overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis were more likely to be overweight or obese at last follow-up. Obesity was more frequently determined in patients who were younger than 6 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Insulin resistance was observed in 8 (21%) subjects. Insulin resistance was more frequently seen in subjects who had family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hyperlipidemia was detected in 8 (21%) patients. Hypothyroidism or premature thelarche were detected in 2 children. Two survivors had osteopenia. Cardiovascular abnormalities occurred in one of the subjects with hypertension and cardiac diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: We point out the necessity of follow-up of these patients for endocrinological and cardiological late effects, since at least one adverse event occurred in most of our cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 16 patients with acute leukemia on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 of chemotherapy. The mononuclear cells were separated from the peripheral blood, and TRAIL expression was assessed by flow cytometry. The bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with acute leukemia were separated before chemotherapy and cultured in vitro with VP-16 and/or interferon (IFN). The TRAIL expression level was detected after the cell culture. RESULTS: TRAIL expression in the mononuclear cells of peripheral blood was significantly upregulated on day 1 (p<0.05) and then significantly decreased on day 5 after chemotherapy (p<0.05). RESULTS from the in vitro culture revealed that VP-16 upregulated TRAIL expression in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with acute leukemia, but the binding of VP-16 to IFN did not enhance TRAIL expression as compared with VP-16 alone (p>0.05). onclusion: OA single chemotherapy mechanism for leukemia may suffice to induce TRAIL expression and promote the apoptosis of leukemic cells.

During the pre-transplant period complete blood count (CBC), liver and renal function tests, coagulation tests, and other parameters were normal. On the first day of transplantation teicoplanin (400 mg d-1 for the first 3 d, and then 400 mg d-1) and caspofungin (first dose was 1x70 mg d-1, followed by 1x50 mg d-1) were started intravenously due to white plaques and oropharyngeal candidiasis in the patient's mouth and perianal erythema. On the 14th d of transplantation watery diarrhea occurred, along with abdominal discomfort, nausea, and fatigue. Stool examination was negative for findings of bleeding. Investigation of Microsporidia confirmed a rare pathogen Encephalitozoon intestinalis in the patient's stool sample via species-specific immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay and albendazole treatment was started at a dose of 2x400 mg d-1. On the 5th d of albendazole treatment (d 18 of treatment) liver function test (LFT) results began to deteriorate. As LFT results continued to deteriorate, albendazole was withdrawn on the 7th d of treatment. Biopsy was performed on the 22nd d of transplantation and histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis. LFT results began to decrease after withdrawal of albendazole treatment. On the 13th d of albendazole treatment all LFT values returned to normal. The presented allo-HSCT case had a rare pathogenic agent (E. intestinalis) that caused diarrhea, as well as hepatotoxicity due to albendazole treatment. This is the first reported case of E. intestinalis diagnosed via IFA in Turkey.

One of the key regulators of angiogenesis is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Among the VEGF family, it has been observed that VEGF-A and VEGF-C are expressed by AML cells and mediate leukemic cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that elevated levels of VEGF or a proangiogenic phenotype may impede, rather than promote, early tumor development and progression. As the significance of VEGF-A and VEGF-C levels in the pathogenesis of AML has not been clarified well, the aim of this study is to evaluate gene expression of these angiogenesis promoters and its possible prognostic value in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Iranian patients with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mRNA expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 27 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 28 healthy controls by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Expression of VEGF-C mRNA was significantly lower in AML patients than in healthy controls (p<0.001). However, there was no significant decrement in expression of VEGF-A mRNA of AML patients compared to the control group (p=0.861). VEGF-A and VEGF-C expression were not able to predict clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that AML is associated with a decreased expression of VEGF-C mRNA. However, expression levels did not influence the clinical outcome in our study. It seems that angiogenesis is affected by different cytokines other than VEGF-C or VEGF-A, and VEGF is also affected by different cytokines. Taken together, these findings help to provide new insights into the investigation of other angiogenic factors and cytokines that may play roles in the pathogenesis of AML.

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and prognostic impact of NPM1 gene mutations in adult AML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) were used to screen 55 AML patients for mutations of NPM1 gene. RESULTS: NPM1 mutations were found in 12 (21.8%) of 55 patients, significantly associated with higher total leukocytie count, marrow blast percentage (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively), and M5 subtype (p<0.001). Patients with NPM1 mutations had significantly higher complete remission rates (p=0.003) and a trend to lower rates of mortality, relapse and refractory disease (p=0.28, p=0.45 and p=0.08, respectively). Survival analysis showed significantly longer disease-free survival (mean 18.635+/-1.229 versus 11.041+/-1.250 months, p=0.044) and overall survival (mean 19.810+/-1.624 versus 12.063+/-1.244 months, p=0.041) in patients with NPM1 mutations compared with those without. Multivariate analyses confirmed NPM1 mutation as a significant independent predictor for disease-free survival (HR=0.066, p=0.001) and overall survival (HR=0.125, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: NPM1 mutation is a prognostic factor for a favorable outcome in Egyptian population. This finding is of major clinical importance since it strongly suggests that NPM1 mutations may allow one to divide the heterogeneous patient group of AML into prognostically different subgroups.

Although rituximab therapy seems to be promising in these cases, persistent hypogammaglobulinemia may appear after treatment due to complete depletion of normal B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Here we report isolated CNS involvement of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in a 4-year-old boy with acute leukemia.

As overall survival has improved, the number of women with CML that wish to become pregnant has increased. As such, attending physicians are faced with a dilemma - continue life-prolonging medication to treat the cancer, or interrupt its use due to its potential teratogenicity. Herein we describe 2 CML patients that gave birth. Case 1 was managed via substitution of imatinib with interferon. The patient's child underwent genetic evaluation at age 3 years, achieved normal developmental milestones, and despite being shorter than his peers was proportional. In terms of morphology, the child had clinodactyly, short fifth fingers, and slightly downward slanting palpebral fissures, but otherwise appeared normal. In case 2 imatinib was continued throughout the pregnancy. This patient's child underwent postpartum evaluation by a geneticist and was observed to be morphologically normal, except for clinodactyly and low-set ears.

RESULTS: A high level of expression of LMO2, LYL1, TAL1, and BMI1 genes was observed in a large group of T-ALL.Several gene expression signatures indicative of leukemic arrest at specific stages of normal thymocyte development(LYL1 and LMO2) were highly expressed during the cortical and mature stages of T-cell development. Furthermore,upregulated TAL1 and BMI1 expression was observed in all phenotypic subgroups. In all, 6 of the patients had TLX1and TLX3 proto-oncogene expression, which does not occur in normal cells, and none of the patients had CALM-AF10fusion gene transcription. Expression of LYL1 alone and LMO2-LYL1 co-expression were associated with mediastinalinvolvement; however, high-level oncogene expression was not predictive of outcome in the present pediatric T-ALLpatient group, but there was a trend towards a poor prognostic impact of TAL1 and/or LMO2 and/or LYL1 protooncogeneexpression. CONCLUSION: Poor prognostic impact of TAL1 and/or LMO2 and/or LYL1 proto-oncogene expression indicate the needfor extensive study on oncogenic rearrangement and immunophenotypic markers in T-ALL, and their relationship totreatment outcome.

This study aimed to investigate the best nutritional assessment method for leukemia patients after HSCT, and find the possible nutritional risk of the patients during the transplantation process in order to intervene in the patients with nutritional risks and undernourished patients timely, so that the entire transplantation process could be successfully completed. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 108 leukemia patients after HSCT, and different nutritional assessment methods, including nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002), mini nutritional assessment (MNA), subjective globe assessment (SGA) and malnutritional universal screening tools (MUST), were used. The associations between nutritional status of these patients and nutritional assessment methods were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients completed SGA, and 99 patients completed NRS2002, MNA and MUST. During the treatment process, 85.2% of the patients lost weight, wherein, 50% lost weight greater than 5%, and 42.6% had significantly reduced food intake. For nutritional risk assessment, the positive rates of NRS2002, MNA and MUST were 100%, 74.7% and 63.6%, respectively. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) among the positive rates of NRS2002, MNA and MUST. In undernutrition assessment, the positive rate of SGA (83.3%) was significantly higher than that of MNA (17.2%) (P<0.05), and the incidence rate of nutritional risk among leukemia patients </=30 years old was greater than that of patients >30 years old (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leukemia were in poor nutritional status during and after HSCT. The leukemia patients </=30 years old had a greater incidence rate of nutritional risk. As nutritional risk screening tool, the specificity of NRS2002 is not high, but it can be used for evaluating nutritional deficiencies. MNA is a good nutritional risk screening tool, but not an adequate tool for nutritional assessment. If assessment of undernutrition is necessary, the combination of all these screening tools and clinical laboratory indicators should be applied to improve accuracy.","['Wang, Boshi', 'Yan, Xia', 'Cai, Jingjing', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Peng']","['Wang B', 'Yan X', 'Cai J', 'Wang Y', 'Liu P']","[""Department of Clinical Nutrition, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Clinical Nutrition, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Clinical Nutrition, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Clinical Nutrition, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,PMC3872547,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/01/05 06:01,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2013.12.09 [doi]', 'cjcr-25-06-762 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2013 Dec;25(6):762-9. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2013.12.09.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Nutritional screening', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)', 'leukemia', 'malnutritional universal screening tools (MUST)', 'mini nutritional assessment (MNA)', 'nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002)', 'subjective globe assessment (SGA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personalized oncology is based on pharmacogenomics and the effect of genetic differences in individuals (germline and somatic) on the way cancer patients respond to chemotherapeutics. Biomarkers detected using molecular biology tools allow the molecular characterization of cancer signatures and provide information relevant for personalized treatment. Biomarkers can be divided into two main subgroups: prognostic and predictive. The aim of the application of prognostic biomarkers, which provide information on the overall cancer outcome in patients, is to facilitate cancer diagnosis, usually with no need for putting invasive methods into use. Predictive biomarkers help to optimize therapy decisions, as they provide information on the likelihood of response to a given chemotherapeutic. Among the prognostic factors that identify patients with different outcome risks (e.g., recurrence of the disease), the following factors can be distinguished: somatic and germline mutations, changes in DNA methylation that lead to the enhancement or suppression of gene expression, the occurrence of elevated levels of microRNA (miRNA) capable of binding specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which affects gene expression, as well as the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood, which leads to a poor prognosis for the patient. Biomarkers for personalized oncology are used mainly in molecular diagnostics of chronic myeloid leukemia, colon, breast and lung cancer, and recently in melanoma. They are successfully used in the evaluation of the benefits that can be achieved through targeted therapy or in the evaluation of toxic effects of the chemotherapeutic used in the therapy.","['Nalejska, Ewelina', 'Maczynska, Ewa', 'Lewandowska, Marzena Anna']","['Nalejska E', 'Maczynska E', 'Lewandowska MA']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery and Tumors, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum, Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Precision Medicine']",PMC4031398,2014/01/05 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40291-013-0077-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2014 Jun;18(3):273-84. doi: 10.1007/s40291-013-0077-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decision-analytic modeling can help to extrapolate data from short-term clinical trials and also consider quality of life when evaluating different treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe and analyze the structural and methodological approaches of published decision-analytic models for various treatment strategies in CML and to derive recommendations for the development of future CML models. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (MEDLINE/PreMEDLINE, EconLit, EMBASE, NHS EED, and Tuft's CEA Registry) to identify published studies evaluating CML treatment strategies using mathematical models. The search was updated in August 2013. STUDY SELECTION: The models were required to compare different treatment strategies in relation to relevant clinical and patient-relevant health outcomes [e.g., life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years] over a defined time horizon and population. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used standardized forms for data extraction, description of study design, methodological framework, and data sources for each model. RESULTS: We identified 18 different decision-analytic modeling studies. Of these, 17 included economic evaluations. Modeling approaches included decision trees, Markov cohort models, state-transition models with individual (Monte Carlo) simulations, and mathematical equations. Analytic time horizons ranged from 2 years to a lifetime. Treatment strategies compared included bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, conventional chemotherapy, interferon-alpha, and TKIs. Only one model evaluated a second-generation TKI. Most models did not report a model validation. All models conducted deterministic sensitivity analyses and four reported a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. LIMITATIONS: Articles that were not published in English or German were not included in this review. Our literature search was restricted to published full-text articles in certain databases.

CONCLUSIONS: While several well-designed models of CML treatment strategies exist, there remains a need for the assessment of the long-term efficacy and cost effectiveness of novel treatment options such as second-generation TKIs.

Aminopeptidases operate downstream of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and are implicated in the final step of intracellular protein degradation either by trimming proteasome-generated peptides for antigen presentation or full hydrolysis into free amino acids for recycling in renewed protein synthesis. This review focuses on the function and subcellular location of five key aminopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, leucine aminopeptidase, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, leukotriene A4 hydrolase and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1/2) and their association with different diseases, in particular cancer and their current position as target for therapeutic intervention by aminopeptidase inhibitors. Historically, bestatin was the first prototypical aminopeptidase inhibitor that entered the clinic 35 years ago and is still used for the treatment of lung cancer. More recently, new generation aminopeptidase inhibitors became available, including the aminopeptidase inhibitor prodrug tosedostat, which is currently tested in phase II clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia. Beyond bestatin and tosedostat, medicinal chemistry has emerged with additional series of potential aminopeptidases inhibitors which are still in an early phase of (pre)clinical investigations. The expanded knowledge of the unique mechanism of action of aminopeptidases has revived interest in aminopeptidase inhibitors for drug combination regimens in anti-cancer treatment. In this context, this review will discuss relevant features and mechanisms of action of aminopeptidases and will also elaborate on factors contributing to aminopeptidase inhibitor efficacy and/or loss of efficacy due to drug resistance-related phenomena. Together, a growing body of data point to aminopeptidase inhibitors as attractive tools for combination chemotherapy, hence their implementation may be a step forward in a new era of personalized treatment of cancer patients.","['Hitzerd, Sarina M', 'Verbrugge, Sue Ellen', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Peters, Godefridus J']","['Hitzerd SM', 'Verbrugge SE', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Jansen G', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Rm 1.42, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140103,Austria,Amino Acids,Amino acids,9200312,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics']",,2014/01/05 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00726-013-1648-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Amino Acids. 2014 Apr;46(4):793-808. doi: 10.1007/s00726-013-1648-0.

We aim to detect the miRNAs that are correlated with the cancer stem cells in CML to provide theoretical basis for clinical application. We first analyzed microRNA expression profiles of CML leukemia patients compared with normal controls by microarray analysis and validated the results by real-time PCR. A single microRNA signature classified CML from normal was detected. We also determined the absolute copy numbers of these three microRNAs in normal adults. The results showed that three microRNAs (miR-150, miR-23a, and miR-130a) were identified to significantly decrease in expanded 38 CML patients compared with 90 normal controls. Molecular and statistical analysis showed that the decreased microRNAs were significant in clinical analysis. All these results indicated that those three microRNAs could act as a tumor suppressor and their decreased expression might be one of the causes of leukemia. Accordingly, clarifying their regulatory mechanisms might delineate their potentials as drug targets of gene therapy for CML.","['Zhu, Xishan', 'Lin, Ziying', 'Du, Jing', 'Zhou, Xu', 'Yang, Lawei', 'Liu, Gang']","['Zhu X', 'Lin Z', 'Du J', 'Zhou X', 'Yang L', 'Liu G']","['Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, Zhanjiang, 524001, China, zhuxishan@tsinghua.org.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140103,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-013-1958-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2014 May;390(1-2):75-84. doi: 10.1007/s11010-013-1958-2.

However, loading DC with apoptotic tumor cells may interfere with DC function. Previously, it was shown in mice that apoptotic blebs induce DC maturation, whereas apoptotic cell remnants (ACR) do not. Here, we analyzed human monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) functionality in vitro, after ingesting either allogeneic AML-derived ACR or blebs. We show that MoDC ingest blebs to a higher extent and are superior in migrating toward CCL19, as compared to ACR-loaded MoDC. Although MoDC cytokine production was unaffected, co-culturing bleb-loaded MoDC with T cells led to an increased T cell proliferation and IFNgamma production. Moreover, antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells frequencies increased to 0.63 % by priming with bleb-loaded MoDC, compared to 0.16 % when primed with ACR-loaded MoDC. Importantly, CD8(+) T cells primed by bleb-loaded MoDC recognized their specific epitope at one to two orders of magnitude lower concentrations compared to ACR-loaded MoDC. In conclusion, superior ingestion efficiency and migration, combined with favorable T cell cytokine release and CD8(+) T cell priming ability and avidity, point to blebs as the preferred component of apoptotic leukemic cells for LAA loading of DC for the immunotherapy of AML.","['Ruben, Jurjen M', 'van den Ancker, Willemijn', 'Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Hooijberg, Erik', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Ruben JM', 'van den Ancker W', 'Bontkes HJ', 'Westers TM', 'Hooijberg E', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'de Gruijl TD', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140103,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma Release Tests', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-013-1515-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2014 Apr;63(4):335-45. doi: 10.1007/s00262-013-1515-6.

Cutaneous involvement is the most common presentation in BPDCN. At present, the diagnosis and management of BPDCN are still challenging. Due to its rarity, the pediatric experience with BPDCN is especially limited. Herein, we report a special case of BPDCN with diffuse nodular lung metastases and a cutaneous lesion, which achieved a dramatic response to non-Hodgkin lymphoma regimen and remained with complete remission for 2 years. To date, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is commonly thought to be related to a favorable outcome in adults with BPDCN. In contrast to it, ALL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma-type therapy alone seems enough in children with BPDCN with or without cutaneous lesions. SCT should only be performed for children who relapse and achieve a second remission. For pediatric BPDCN, further study of larger numbers of cases is needed to better define prognostic factors and optimal treatment strategy, and understand the underling differences in pathogenesis between children and adults.","['Zhong, Xiao-dan', 'Wang, Li-zhe', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Chang, Jian']","['Zhong XD', 'Wang LZ', 'Wang X', 'Chang J']","['The Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, the First Hospital of Jilin University, MD 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20140103,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/*secondary/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2014/01/05 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-013-2248-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2014 Dec;173(12):1667-70. doi: 10.1007/s00431-013-2248-4.

However, controversy surrounds whether these pathways have independent functions and whether Pten loss is sufficient to generate resistance to Notch inhibition. Here we report that Pten(-/-) T-ALL is sensitive to either PI3K/mTOR or Notch inhibition alone, each pathway controlling distinct downstream signaling events that cannot be rescued by activation of the other pathway, consistent with independent, non-redundant functions. Although many human T-ALLs display constitutively activating Notch1 mutations, primary Pten(-/-) T-ALLs expressed wild-type Notch1 and depended on the Notch ligand DLL4 in vivo. Pten(-/-) T-ALLs with or without gammac/TCR signaling responded similarly to PI3K/mTOR and Notch inhibition, although extended culture in vitro occasionally induced Notch-independent growth. However, unlike the T-ALLs lacking only Pten, eight of 23 Pten(-/-) T-ALLs that also lacked gammac/TCR signaling accumulated Notch1 mutations, suggesting crosstalk between gammac/TCR and Notch signaling. Importantly, we concluded that loss of gammac/TCR signaling also inhibited thymic exit of Pten(-/-) T-ALLs. Our results may be clinically relevant in revealing that Pten loss is not sufficient to engender resistance to Notch inhibition, uncovering a role in T-ALL for ligand-dependent induction of wild-type Notch1, and suggesting that gammac/TCR signaling could be targeted for preventing metastasis.","['Hagenbeek, Thijs J', 'Wu, Xiumin', 'Choy, Lisa', 'Sanchez-Irizarry, Cheryll', 'Seshagiri, Somasekar', 'Stinson, Jeremy', 'Siebel, Christian W', 'Spits, Hergen']","['Hagenbeek TJ', 'Wu X', 'Choy L', 'Sanchez-Irizarry C', 'Seshagiri S', 'Stinson J', 'Siebel CW', 'Spits H']","['Department of Immunology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Cell Biology and Histology, University of Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Immunology Discovery, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA; Department of Discovery Oncology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.

The incidence of UC increased with age, with peak incidence in patients older than 60 years. These patients had a lower response rate to induction chemotherapy (complete remission rate of 43%) and dismal 5-year survival rates (16%), which was especially poor in patients older than 60 years (<5%). The complete remission and survival rates were similar to those seen in patients with unfavourable karyotype. The early death rate was not increased.

Intracellular signalling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is important for regulation of cellular growth and metabolism, and inhibitors of this pathway is considered for AML treatment. Primary human AML cells, derived from 96 consecutive adult patients, were examined. The effects of two mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, temsirolimus) and two PI3K inhibitors (GDC-0941, 3-methyladenine) were studied, and we investigated cytokine-dependent proliferation, regulation of apoptosis and global gene expression profiles. Only a subset of patients demonstrated strong antiproliferative effects of PI3K-mTOR inhibitors. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis identified two main clusters of patients; one subset showing weak or absent antiproliferative effects (59%) and another group showing a strong growth inhibition for all drugs and concentrations examined (41%). Global gene expression analyses showed that patients with AML cell resistance against PI3K-mTOR inhibitors showed increased mRNA expression of the CDC25B gene that encodes the cell cycle regulator Cell Division Cycle 25B. The antileukaemic effect of PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibition varies between patients, and resistance to these inhibitors is associated with the expression of the cell cycle regulator CDC25B, which is known to crosstalk with the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and mediate rapamycin resistance in experimental models.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Skrede, Silje', 'Holdhus, Rita', 'Poulain, Laury', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Hatfield, Kimberley J', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Tamburini J', 'Skrede S', 'Holdhus R', 'Poulain L', 'Ersvaer E', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Bruserud O']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway; Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131023,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0', '(2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-ylth', 'ieno(3,2-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Transcriptome', 'Treatment Outcome', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,2014/01/05 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12611 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Jan;164(2):200-11. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12611.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on Candida catheter-related bloodstream infections recommend systemic antifungal therapy and catheter removal. In this study, we focused on our experience with antifungal failure due to totally implanted catheter-associated C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections. We investigated cases leading to port removal in pediatric malignancy patients and the associated patient outcomes. In the first phase of the study, a retrospective chart review was performed to collect patient information, including primary disease; time from hospitalization to port-related candidemia; antifungal drug choice; and the time at which port removal occurred. During the second phase, antifungal susceptibility tests for C. parapsilosis were performed in our microbiology laboratory. All patients had fevers and were neutropenic at the time of candidemia diagnosis. The mean duration between the first isolation of Candida parapsilosis from the port samples to the port removal was 9.75 +/- 5.29 days for 11 patients. Patient fevers lasted for a mean time of 16.22 +/- 6.51 days. The median recovery duration from fever after CVC removal was four days (range 2-12 days). The median duration for achieving negative blood cultures, following antifungal treatment was 18 days (range 10-27 days). Our data favored the removal of catheters in the presence of ongoing fever, as suggested by the guidelines, independent of the chosen antifungal treatment.

In the previous study, we identified the gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of actinomycin G2 -G4 . Inactivation of acmG5' gene in the actinomycin G gene cluster in S. iakyrus completely abolished the production of actinomycin G. Metabolic profiling, chemical isolation, and structural elucidation of the resulting mutant SIADeltaacmG5' showed a previously unnoticed metabolite phenazinomycin in S. iakyrus. In silico analysis identified a hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of S. iakyrus that could be responsible for the biosynthesis of phenazinomycin.

There are 70,000 deaths among U.S. patients with hematologic malignancies yearly. OBJECTIVE: We measured the use and length of stay (LOS) in hospice among patients with HMs at a large academic cancer center. DESIGN: This was a single center retrospective review of adult patients (>/=18 years) with lymphoma, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and multiple myeloma referred for hospice. MEASUREMENTS: Information included demographics, transplant, hospice type, LOS, and use of ""expanded access"" services. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were referred to hospice, and 53 utilized hospice services, 25% of 209 HM decedents. Thirty-five received home hospice and 18 used inpatient hospice. The median home hospice LOS was nine days (SD 13) and inpatient hospice six days (SD 10). Nine patients with ""expanded access"" hospice received only a few blood transfusions, and none received radiation. CONCLUSIONS: HM patients are referred late or never for hospice services. Studies evaluating earlier integration of palliative and hospice care with usual HM care are warranted. We present a one-page negotiation form that we have found useful in negotiations among HM physicians, hospice medical directors, and payers.","['Sexauer, Amy', 'Cheng, M Jennifer', 'Knight, Louise', 'Riley, Anthony W', 'King, Lauren', 'Smith, Thomas J']","['Sexauer A', 'Cheng MJ', 'Knight L', 'Riley AW', 'King L', 'Smith TJ']","['1 Oncology Department, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140102,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Hospices/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Terminal Care', 'United States']",PMC3997144,2014/01/05 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/01/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jpm.2013.0250 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2014 Feb;17(2):195-9. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2013.0250.

HSC gene therapy clinical studies have resulted in functional cures for several diseases, but in some studies clonal expansion or leukemia has occurred. This is due to the dyregulation of endogenous host gene expression from vector provirus insertional mutagenesis. Insertional mutagenesis screens using replicating retroviruses have been used extensively to identify genes that influence oncogenesis. However, retroviral mutagenesis screens can also be used to determine the role of genes in biological processes such as stem cell engraftment. The aim of this review is to describe the potential for vector insertion site data from gene therapy studies to provide novel insights into mechanisms of HSC engraftment. In HSC gene therapy studies dysregulation of host genes by replication-incompetent vector proviruses may lead to enrichment of repopulating clones with vector integrants near genes that influence engraftment. Thus, data from HSC gene therapy studies can be used to identify novel candidate engraftment genes. As HSC gene therapy use continues to expand, the vector insertion site data collected will be of great interest to help identify novel engraftment genes and may ultimately lead to new therapies to improve engraftment.","['Powers, John M', 'Trobridge, Grant D']","['Powers JM', 'Trobridge GD']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, USA ; School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Stem Cell Res Ther,Journal of stem cell research & therapy,101586297,,,,PMC3875223,2014/01/03 06:00,2014/01/03 06:01,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4172/2157-7633.S3-004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Stem Cell Res Ther. 2013 Sep 1;2013(Suppl 3). doi: 10.4172/2157-7633.S3-004.,,,,"['P01 AI097100/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI102672/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 CA173598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS534589'],['NOTNLM'],"['Engraftment', 'Gene therapy', 'Hematopoietic stem cell', 'Insertional mutagenesis', 'Viral vector']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This treatment is effective as a monotherapy as well as a therapeutic adjuvant to chemotherapy and radiation. Iron oxide nanoparticles have been shown, so far, to be non-toxic, as are the exciting AMF fields when used at moderate levels. Although higher levels of AMF can be more effective, depending on the type of iron oxide nanoparticles use, these higher field strengths and/or frequencies can induce normal tissue heating and toxicity. Thus, the use of nanoparticles exhibiting significant heating at low AMF strengths and frequencies is desirable. Our preliminary experiments have shown that the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles within tumor cells improves their heating effect and cytotoxicity per nanoparticle. We have used transmission electron microscopy to track the endocytosis of nanoparticles into tumor cells (both breast adenocarcinoma (MTG-B) and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells). Our preliminary results suggest that nanoparticles internalized into tumor cells demonstrate greater cytotoxicity when excited with AMF than an equivalent heat dose from excited external nanoparticles or cells exposed to a hot water bath. We have also demonstrated that this increase in SAR caused by aggregation improves the cytotoxicity of nanoparticle hyperthermia therapy in vitro.","['Giustini, Andrew J', 'Gottesman, Rachel E', 'Petryk, A A', 'Rauwerdink, A M', 'Hoopes, P Jack']","['Giustini AJ', 'Gottesman RE', 'Petryk AA', 'Rauwerdink AM', 'Hoopes PJ']","['Dartmouth Medical School, 1 Rope Ferry Road, Hanover, NH, USA 03755 ; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, 8000 Cummings Hall, Hanover, NH USA 03755.', 'Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, 8000 Cummings Hall, Hanover, NH USA 03755.', 'Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, 8000 Cummings Hall, Hanover, NH USA 03755.', 'Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, 8000 Cummings Hall, Hanover, NH USA 03755.', 'Dartmouth Medical School, 1 Rope Ferry Road, Hanover, NH, USA 03755 ; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, 8000 Cummings Hall, Hanover, NH USA 03755.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,101524122,,,,PMC3874720,2011/02/10 00:00,2011/02/10 00:01,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1117/12.876519 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng. 2011 Feb 10;7901. doi: 10.1117/12.876519.,,,,"['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS527793'],['NOTNLM'],"['AMF', 'Hyperthermia', 'SAR', 'intracellular hyperthermia', 'nanoparticle', 'specific absorption rate', 'tumor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current approaches either adopt a single marker test which ignores the possible interaction among genes or consider a multistage procedure that reduces the large size of genes before evaluation of the association. Among the latter, Bayesian analysis can further accommodate the correlation between genes through the specification of a multivariate prior distribution and estimate the probabilities of association through latent variables. The covariance matrix, however, depends on an unknown parameter. In this research, we suggested a reference hyperprior distribution for such uncertainty, outlined the implementation of its computation, and illustrated this fully Bayesian approach with a colon and leukemia cancer study. Comparison with other existing methods was also conducted. The classification accuracy of our proposed model is higher with a smaller set of selected genes.

Among the entire cohort, baseline grade 4 neutropenia (i.e., absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/microL) was associated with development of fever (P = 0.04), documented infection (P < 0.0001), and bacteremia (P = 0.002) but not requirement for intensive care unit-level care; after exclusion of the 30 patients who received ""7 + 3""-like induction, baseline grade 4 neutropenia remained associated with documented infection (P < 0.0001) and bacteremia (P = 0.0005). Among patients achieving a complete remission with the initial treatment cycle, grade 4 neutropenia was associated with delayed neutrophil count recovery (P < 0.0001). Low monocyte and lymphocyte counts at baseline were similarly associated with increased risk of documented infection or bacteremia. After adjustment for age, gender, disease type, cytogenetic/molecular risk, and performance status, the risk of fever, documented infection, or bacteremia was 1.87 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.34; P=0.04)-fold, 4.95 (2.20-11.16; P<0.001)-fold, and 3.14 (0.99-9.98; P=0.05)-fold higher in patients with initial grade 4 neutropenia. Together, our studies identify severe baseline neutropenia as a risk factor for infection-associated adverse events after induction chemotherapy and may provide the rationale for the risk-adapted testing of myeloid growth factor support in this high-risk AML/MDS patient subset.","['Buckley, Sarah A', 'Othus, Megan', 'Vainstein, Vladimir', 'Abkowitz, Janis L', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Buckley SA', 'Othus M', 'Vainstein V', 'Abkowitz JL', 'Estey EH', 'Walter RB']","['Department of Medicine, Residency Program, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140224,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', '7+3 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Critical Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infections/epidemiology/etiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC4391649,2014/01/03 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2013/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23661 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Apr;89(4):423-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23661.

Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR) may harbor minimal residual disease that is susceptible to rIL-2-activated effector cells. METHODS: In the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 19808 study, patients with AML in first CR were randomly assigned after all planned chemotherapy to receive a 90-day course of subcutaneously administered rIL-2 or no further therapy. The primary objective was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) between the 2 treatment arms. A total of 534 patients achieved a CR, 214 of whom were randomized. Six courses of low-dose daily rIL-2 were given for the expansion of cytotoxic effector cells, each followed by 3-day high-dose boluses given to trigger cytotoxicity against minimal residual disease. RESULTS: On the protocol-specified intention-to-treat analysis, the hazards ratio for DFS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.09; P = .13); the 5-year DFS rate was 42% in the observation arm and 53% in the rIL-2 treatment arm. The hazards ratio for overall survival (OS) was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.23; P = .34); the 5-year OS rate was 58% for the observation arm and 63% for the rIL-2 treatment arm. Twenty-five of the 107 patients randomized to treatment with rIL-2 either refused or were unable to initiate therapy and 30 patients did not complete their assigned therapy. However, significant toxicities were not commonly observed. The trial design did not anticipate the difficulties patients would encounter with protocol compliance. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of immunotherapy with rIL-2 administered after intensive postremission treatment was not assessed as planned because of unexpected refusals by patients and/or their physicians to comply with protocol-directed therapy. Neither DFS nor OS was found to be significantly improved.","['Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'George, Stephen L', 'Benson, Don M Jr', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Bakan, Courtney E', 'Hars, Vera', 'Hoke, Eva', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Kolitz JE', 'George SL', 'Benson DM Jr', 'Maharry K', 'Marcucci G', 'Vij R', 'Powell BL', 'Allen SL', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Shea TC', 'Stock W', 'Bakan CE', 'Hars V', 'Hoke E', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA']","['Don Monti Division of Oncology/Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Lake Success, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131231,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4139069,2014/01/03 06:00,2014/07/11 06:00,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28516 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Apr 1;120(7):1010-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28516.

In this study, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of Aurora kinase inhibitors in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Western blot analysis showed that both Aurora-A and Aurora-B are overexpressed in ALL cell lines and primary ALL cells. Both VE-465 and VX-680 effectively inhibited Aurora kinase activities in nine ALL cell lines, which exhibited different susceptibilities to the inhibitors. Cells sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors underwent apoptosis at an IC50 of approximately 10-30 nM and displayed a phenotype of Aurora-A inhibition, whereas cells resistant to Aurora kinase inhibitors (with an IC50 more than 10 muM) accumulated polyploidy, which may have resulted from Aurora-B inhibition. Drug susceptibility of ALL cell lines was not correlated with the expression level or activation status of Aurora kinases. Interestingly, RS4;11 and MV4;11 cells, which contain the MLL-AF4 gene, were both sensitive to Aurora kinase-A inhibitors treatment. Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis suggested that CDKN1A might govern the drug responsiveness of ALL cell lines in a TP53-independent manner. Most importantly, primary ALL cells with MLL-AF4 and CDKN1A expression were sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors. Our study suggests CDKN1A could be a potential biomarker in determining the drug responsiveness of Aurora kinase inhibitors in ALL, particularly in MLL-AF4-positive patients.","['Chen, Ya-Ping', 'Lin, Hui-Ju', 'Chen, Jiann-Shiuh', 'Tsai, Ming-Ying', 'Hsieh, Hsing-Pang', 'Chang, Jang-Yang', 'Chen, Nai-Feng', 'Chang, Kung-Chao', 'Huang, Wen-Tsung', 'Su, Wu-Chou', 'Yang, Shu-Ting', 'Chang, Wen-Chang', 'Hung, Liang-Yi', 'Chen, Tsai-Yun']","['Chen YP', 'Lin HJ', 'Chen JS', 'Tsai MY', 'Hsieh HP', 'Chang JY', 'Chen NF', 'Chang KC', 'Huang WT', 'Su WC', 'Yang ST', 'Chang WC', 'Hung LY', 'Chen TY']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140113,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,2014/01/03 06:00,2014/07/23 06:00,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28708 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Aug 1;135(3):751-62. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28708.

To analyze the changes that second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have brought in mutation frequency and type, a database review was undertaken of the results of all the BCR-ABL KD mutation analyses performed in the authors' laboratory from January 2004 to January 2013. METHODS: Interrogation of the database retrieved 450 mutation analyses in 272 patients with Ph+ ALL. Prescreening of samples was performed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), followed by direct sequencing of D-HPLC-positive cases. RESULTS: BCR-ABL KD mutations were detected in 70% of imatinib-resistant patients, with T315I, E255K, and Y253H mutations accounting for 75% of cases. Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported to be resistant to second-generation TKIs after imatinib failure were positive for mutations, and 58% of them had multiple mutations. Analysis of patients relapsing on dasatinib revealed a newly acquired T315I mutation in almost two-thirds of the cases. Direct sequencing detected no mutations at diagnosis, even in patients who relapsed after a few months. CONCLUSIONS: Second-generation TKIs ensure a more rapid debulking of the leukemic clone and have much fewer insensitive mutations, but long-term disease control remains a problem, and the T315I mutation is revealed to be an even more frequent enemy. BCR-ABL KD mutation screening of patients with Ph+ ALL who are receiving imatinib or second-generation TKIs would be a precious ally for timely treatment optimization. In contrast, the clinical usefulness of conventional direct sequencing at diagnosis seems to be very low.

OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes of breast-conserving therapy for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with those of patients with the luminal A, luminal B, and ERBB2 subtypes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective database review at an academic tertiary medical center with a designated breast cancer center. We included 1851 consecutive patients ages 29 to 85 years with stages I to III invasive breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving therapy at a single institution from January 1, 2000, through May 30, 2012. Of these patients, 234 (12.6%) had TNBC; 1341 (72.4%), luminal A subtype; 212 (11.5%), luminal B subtype; and 64 (3.5%), ERBB2-enriched subtype. EXPOSURE: Breast-conserving therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was local recurrence (LR). Secondary outcome measures included regional recurrence, distant recurrence, and overall survival. RESULTS Triple-negative breast cancer was associated with younger age at diagnosis (56 vs 60 years; P = .001), larger tumors (2.1 vs 1.8 cm; P < .001), more stage II vs I cancer (42.1% vs 33.6%; P = .005), and more G3 tumors (86.4% vs 28.4%; P < .001) compared with the non-TNBC subtypes. Multivariable analysis showed that TNBC did not have a significantly increased risk of LR compared with the luminal A (hazard ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.6-3.3]; P = .43), luminal B (1.6 [0.5-5.2]; P = .43), and ERBB2 (1.1 [0.2-5.2]; P = .87) subtypes. Only tumor size was a significant predictor of LR (hazard ratio, 4.7 [95% CI, 1.6-14.3]; P = .006). Predictors of worse overall survival included tumor size, grade, and stage and TNBC subtype. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Breast-conserving therapy for TNBC is not associated with increased LR compared with non-TNBC subtypes. However, the TNBC phenotype correlates with worse overall survival. Breast-conserving therapy is appropriate for patients with TNBC.","['Gangi, Alexandra', 'Chung, Alice', 'Mirocha, James', 'Liou, Douglas Z', 'Leong, Trista', 'Giuliano, Armando E']","['Gangi A', 'Chung A', 'Mirocha J', 'Liou DZ', 'Leong T', 'Giuliano AE']","['Department of Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Health Information, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Surg,JAMA surgery,101589553,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/03 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1793208 [pii]', '10.1001/jamasurg.2013.3037 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Surg. 2014 Mar;149(3):252-8. doi: 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.3037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of common mechanisms underlying LIC development will be important in establishing broadly effective therapeutics for AML. Constitutive NF-kappaB pathway activation has been reported in different types of AML; however, the mechanism of NF-kappaB activation and its importance in leukemia progression are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed myeloid leukemia mouse models to assess NF-kappaB activity in AML LICs. We found that LICs, but not normal hematopoietic stem cells or non-LIC fractions within leukemia cells, exhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activity. This activity was maintained through autocrine TNF-alpha secretion, which formed an NF-kappaB/TNF-alpha positive feedback loop. LICs had increased levels of active proteasome machinery, which promoted the degradation of IkappaBalpha and further supported NF-kappaB activity. Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome complex markedly suppressed leukemia progression in vivo. Conversely, enhanced activation of NF-kappaB signaling expanded LIC frequency within leukemia cell populations. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha secretion in human AML samples. Our findings indicate that NF-kappaB/TNF-alpha signaling in LICs contributes to leukemia progression and provide a widely applicable approach for targeting LICs.","['Kagoya, Yuki', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Kobayashi, Hiroshi', 'Saito, Taku', 'Iwakura, Yoichiro', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Kagoya Y', 'Yoshimi A', 'Kataoka K', 'Nakagawa M', 'Kumano K', 'Arai S', 'Kobayashi H', 'Saito T', 'Iwakura Y', 'Kurokawa M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140102,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/chemistry', 'Pyrazines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",PMC3904603,2014/01/03 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2014/01/03 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['68101 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI68101 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Feb;124(2):528-42. doi: 10.1172/JCI68101.

Some naphthyridines have antimitotic effects or demonstrate anticancer activity by inhibiting topoisomerase II. These compounds have been investigated as potential anticancer agents, and several compounds are now part of clinical trials. A series of naphthyridine derivatives were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activities against human cervical cancer (HeLa), leukemia (HL-60), and prostate cancer (PC-3) cell lines using an MTT assay. Some compounds (14, 15, and 16) were more potent than colchicine against all three human cancer cell lines and compound (16) demonstrated potency with IC50 values of 0.7, 0.1, and 5.1 microM, respectively. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) molecular modeling of these compounds. We obtained accurate and predictive three-dimensional QSAR (3D-QSAR) models as indicated by the high PLS parameters of the HeLa (q(2), 0.857; r(2), 0.984; r(2) pred, 0.966), HL-60 (q(2), 0.777; r(2), 0.937; r(2) pred, 0.913), and PC-3 (q(2), 0.702; r(2), 0.983; r(2) pred, 0.974) cell lines.

Loss of TP53 activity, through mutation or deletion, is highly associated with t-MNs with a del(5q). We previously demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of Egr1 and Apc, 2 genes lost in the 5q deletion, are key players in the progression of MDS with a del(5q). Using genetically engineered mice, we now show that reduction or loss of Tp53 expression, in combination with Egr1 haploinsufficiency, increased the rate of development of hematologic neoplasms and influenced the disease spectrum, but did not lead to overt myeloid leukemia, suggesting that altered function of additional gene(s) on 5q are likely required for myeloid leukemia development. Next, we demonstrated that cell intrinsic loss of Tp53 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells haploinsufficient for both Egr1 and Apc led to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 17% of mice. The long latency (234-299 days) and clonal chromosomal abnormalities in the AMLs suggest that additional genetic changes may be required for full transformation. Thus, loss of Tp53 activity in cooperation with Egr1 and Apc haploinsufficiency creates an environment that is permissive for malignant transformation and the development of AML.","['Stoddart, Angela', 'Fernald, Anthony A', 'Wang, Jianghong', 'Davis, Elizabeth M', 'Karrison, Theodore', 'Anastasi, John', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Stoddart A', 'Fernald AA', 'Wang J', 'Davis EM', 'Karrison T', 'Anastasi J', 'Le Beau MM']",['Department of Medicine and.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131231,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, APC', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic']",PMC3924928,2014/01/02 06:00,2014/04/22 06:00,['2014/01/02 06:00'],"['2014/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36025-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-517953 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 13;123(7):1069-78. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-517953.

We used the Netherlands Cancer Registry data of 1,313,232 cancer survivors who were at risk to be subsequently diagnosed with CLL between 1989 and 2008. Cancer survivors were categorized based on gender, age, time since diagnosis of EPM and type of EPM. CLL was regarded synchronous when diagnosed within 3 months after diagnosis of EPM; metachronous CLLs were those diagnosed later. Overall, we found that cancer survivors had a 90 % higher risk to be diagnosed with CLL than the general population. In the first year after diagnosis, we found a more than four-fold increased risk of CLL (standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 4.4; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 4.1-4.8); however, no increased risk was observed after excluding synchronous cases. After 1 year, the excess risk of subsequent CLL ranged from 1.2 to 1.8. An increased risk for metachronous CLL was found in prostate (SIR 1.3; 95 % CI 1.1-1.5) and squamous cell skin cancer survivors (SIR 2.3; 95 % CI 1.9-2.7). Intensive clinical checkups after/around diagnosis of the EPM seemed to be the main cause for the increased risk of CLL among cancer survivors. However, possible shared risk factors between prostate cancer and CLL and skin cancer and CLL cannot be excluded. Further clinical research aimed at CLL as subsequent primary malignancy (SPM) is warranted to elucidate possible shared biological and predisposing risk factors.","['van den Broek, E C', 'Liu, L', 'Posthuma, E F M', 'Janssen-Heijnen, M L G', 'Coebergh, J W W', 'Soerjomataram, I']","['van den Broek EC', 'Liu L', 'Posthuma EF', 'Janssen-Heijnen ML', 'Coebergh JW', 'Soerjomataram I']","['Department of Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre South (IKZ), Eindhoven, The Netherlands, e.vd.broek@ikz.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131025,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Care Facilities/statistics & numerical data', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/02 06:00,2014/02/27 06:00,['2014/01/02 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1929-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Jan;93(1):157-62. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1929-4.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, is a key regulator in the maintenance of naive states for both human and mouse stem cells. In this study, we describe a new recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) using a plant-based (rice) expression system. We found that rice-derived rhLIF possessed the same specific activity as commercial Escherichia coli-derived LIF and was capable of supporting mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation in the undifferentiated state as evidenced from pluripotency marker level analysis.

This study assessed the incidence of ON requiring primary TJA in children and young adults treated for leukemia or lymphoma. Methods: Patients diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma before 31 years of age were identified from the Finnish and Danish Cancer Registries. These data were combined with those from the National Hospital Discharge and the Finnish Arthroplasty Registers. Data on the orthopedic procedures performed and the appropriate diagnosis codes given before the age of 40 were also retrieved. Results: The estimated cumulative incidence of TJA was 4.5% at 20 years for patients treated for chronic myeloid leukemia, followed by 2.1% for patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia. It was considerably lower in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 0.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) increased the risk of TJA (hazard ratio [HR]=9.4; 95% CI: 5.3-16.9). The risk of TJA was higher in patients diagnosed with cancer at 10-19 and 20-30 years of age than in those diagnosed before the age of 10 (HR=24; 95% CI: 3.1-176 and HR=26; 95% CI: 3.6-192 respectively). Conclusion: The incidence of ON requiring TJA was highest among patients with myeloid leukemias and lowest in patients treated for ALL. Allo-SCT and age >/=10 years at diagnosis were the most important risk factors for ON requiring TJA in hematological malignancies.","['Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Hansen, Lene Molgaard', 'Niinimaki, Tuukka', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Pokka, Tytti', 'Sankila, Risto', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Harila-Saari, Arja']","['Niinimaki R', 'Hansen LM', 'Niinimaki T', 'Olsen JH', 'Pokka T', 'Sankila R', 'Vettenranta K', 'Hasle H', 'Harila-Saari A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital , Oulu, Finland .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus, Denmark .', 'Department of Surgery, Oulu University Hospital , Oulu, Finland .', 'Danish Cancer Society, Institute of Cancer Epidemiology , Copenhagen, Denmark .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital , Oulu, Finland .', 'Finnish Cancer Registry, Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research , Helsinki, Finland .', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Helsinki University Central Hospital , Helsinki, Finland .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus, Denmark .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital , Oulu, Finland .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,,,PMC3869417,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/01/01 06:01,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/jayao.2013.0006 [doi]', '10.1089/jayao.2013.0006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2013 Dec 1;2(4):138-144. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2013.0006.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'osteonecrosis', 'total joint arthroplasty']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, NK cells are the first lymphocyte population recovering after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Thus, their role in early immunity after HSCT is considered crucial, as they can importantly contribute to protect the host from tumor recurrence and viral infections before T-cell immunity is fully recovered. In order to acquire effector functions and regulatory receptors, NK cell precursors undergo a maturation process that can be analyzed during immune reconstitution after HSCT. In this context, the occurrence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection/reactivation was shown to accelerate NK cell maturation by promoting the differentiation of high frequencies of NK cells characterized by a KIR(+)NKG2A(-) and NKG2C(+) mature phenotype. Thus, it appears that the development of NK cells and the distribution of NK cell receptors can be deeply influenced by HCMV infection. Moreover, in HCMV-infected subjects the emergence of so called ""memory-like"" or ""long-lived"" NK cells has been documented. These cells could play an important role in protecting from infections and maybe from relapse in patients transplanted for leukemia. All the aspects regarding the influence of HCMV infection on NK cell development will be discussed.","['Della Chiesa, Mariella', 'Falco, Michela', 'Muccio, Letizia', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Moretta, Alessandro']","['Della Chiesa M', 'Falco M', 'Muccio L', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'Moretta A']","['DI.ME.S.

The aim of the study was to establish the frequency of postchemotherapy chronic kidney dysfunction in children and to assess the efficacy of IL-18, KIM-1, and beta-2 microglobulin in the detection of chronic nephropathy. We examined eighty-five patients after chemotherapy (median age of twelve years). The median age at the point of diagnosis was 4.2 years, and the median follow-up time was 4.6 years. We performed classic laboratory tests assessing kidney function and compared the results with novel markers (KIM-1, beta-2 microglobulin, and IL-18). Features of subclinical renal injury were identified in forty-eight children (56.3% of the examined group). Nephropathy, especially tubulopathy, appeared more frequently in patients treated with ifosfamide, cisplatin, and/or carboplatin, following nephrectomy or abdominal radiotherapy (P = 0.14, P = 0.11, and P = 0.08, resp.). Concentrations of IL-18 and beta-2 microglobulin were comparable with classic signs of tubulopathy (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.05). Concentrations of IL-18 were also significantly higher in children treated with highly nephrotoxic drugs (P = 0.0004) following nephrectomy (P = 0.0007) and abdominal radiotherapy (P = 0.01). Concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin were higher after highly toxic chemotherapy (P = 0.004) and after radiotherapy (P = 0.02). ROC curves created utilizing IL-18 data allowed us to distinguish between children with nephropathy (value 28.8 pg/mL) and tubulopathy (37.1 pg/mL). Beta-2 microglobulin and IL-18 seem to be promising markers of chronic renal injury in children after chemotherapy.","['Zubowska, Malgorzata', 'Wyka, Krystyna', 'Fendler, Wojciech', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Zalewska-Szewczyk, Beata']","['Zubowska M', 'Wyka K', 'Fendler W', 'Mlynarski W', 'Zalewska-Szewczyk B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, 91-738 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, 91-738 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, 91-738 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, 91-738 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, 91-738 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Carboplatin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-18/*blood', 'Kidney/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'ROC Curve', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*blood/chemically induced', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",PMC3860090,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/07/09 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/369784 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Markers. 2013;35(6):811-8. doi: 10.1155/2013/369784.

Our previous studies indicated that RBBP1 possesses a Tudor domain, which cannot bind histone marks. In order to clarify the function of the Tudor domain, the solution structure of the RBBP1 Tudor domain was determined by NMR and is presented here. Although the proteins are unrelated, the RBBP1 Tudor domain forms an interdigitated double Tudor structure similar to the Tudor domain of JMJD2A, which is an epigenetic mark reader. This indicates the functional diversity of Tudor domains. The RBBP1 Tudor domain structure has a significant area of positively charged surface, which reveals a capability of the RBBP1 Tudor domain to bind nucleic acids. NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicate that the RBBP1 Tudor domain binds both double- and single-stranded DNA with an affinity of 10-100 muM; no apparent DNA sequence specificity was detected. The DNA binding mode and key interaction residues were analyzed in detail based on a model structure of the Tudor domain-dsDNA complex, built by HADDOCK docking using the NMR data. Electrostatic interactions mediate the binding of the Tudor domain with DNA, which is consistent with NMR experiments performed at high salt concentration. The DNA-binding residues are conserved in Tudor domains of the RBBP1 protein family, resulting in conservation of the DNA-binding function in the RBBP1 Tudor domains. Our results provide further insights into the structure and function of RBBP1.","['Gong, Weibin', 'Wang, Jinfeng', 'Perrett, Sarah', 'Feng, Yingang']","['Gong W', 'Wang J', 'Perrett S', 'Feng Y']","['From the National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131230,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Solutions)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM4A protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Calorimetry', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Solutions', 'Titrimetry']",PMC3931050,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)44130-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.501940 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Feb 21;289(8):4882-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.501940.

We generated transgenic (Tg) mice with human ROR1 regulated by the murine Ig promoter/enhancer. In contrast to nontransgenic littermates, such animals had B-cell-restricted expression of ROR1 and could develop clonal expansions of ROR1(bright)CD5(+)B220(low) B cells resembling human CLL at >/= 15 mo of age. Because immune-precipitation and mass spectrometry studies revealed that ROR1 could complex with T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) in CLL, we crossed these animals with Emicro-TCL1-Tg (TCL1) mice. Progeny with both transgenes (ROR1 x TCL1) developed CD5(+)B220(low) B-cell lymphocytosis and leukemia at a significantly younger median age than did littermates with either transgene alone. ROR1 x TCL1 leukemia B cells had higher levels of phospho-AKT than TCL1 leukemia cells and expressed high levels of human ROR1, which we also found complexed with TCL1. Transcriptome analyses revealed that ROR1 x TCL1 leukemia cells had higher expression of subnetworks implicated in embryonic and tumor-cell proliferation, but lower expression of subnetworks involved in cell-cell adhesion or cell death than did TCL1 leukemia cells. ROR1 x TCL1 leukemia cells also had higher proportions of Ki-67-positive cells, lower proportions of cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis, and produced more aggressive disease upon adoptive transfer than TCL1 leukemia cells. However, treatment with an anti-ROR1 mAb resulted in ROR1 down-modulation, reduced phospho-AKT, and impaired engraftment of ROR1 x TCL1 leukemia cells. Our data demonstrate that ROR1 accelerates development/progression of leukemia and may be targeted for therapy of patients with CLL.","['Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Cui, Bing', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Messer, Karen', 'Shen, Zhouxin', 'Briggs, Steven P', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Cui B', 'Ghia EM', 'Chen L', 'Messer K', 'Shen Z', 'Briggs SP', 'Croce CM', 'Kipps TJ']","['Departments of Medicine and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics and Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131230,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/immunology/*metabolism']",PMC3896194,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1308374111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1308374111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 14;111(2):793-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1308374111.

The mechanism the mechanism of the disease development still remains unrevealed. In recent years new unique molecular and clinical features of CLL have emerged leading to a unified hypothesis of CLL origin. Major progress in understanding CLL biology was made after identification of mutational status of immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IGHV) genes, which also improved prediction of patients' clinical outcome. Preferential usage of IGHV genes has led to recognition of CLL-specific B cell receptors (BCRs), called stereotyped BCRs.

Arsenic trioxide, used for relapsed disease, further improved the survival rate of patients. The classical model presented the therapeutic success as a result of over-coming of the differentiation block characteristic of neoplastic cells. However, the resent in vivo and ex vivo studies, seem to show that the induction of differentiation process is not required to cure acute promyelocytic leukemia. Rather than inducing differentiation, targeting clonogenic leukemia initiating cells or destroying PML-RARa fusion protein may represent a more effective therapeutic goal in this type of leukemia.","['Podhorecka, Monika', 'Macheta, Arkadiusz']","['Podhorecka M', 'Macheta A']","['Klinika Hematoonkologii i Transplantacji Szpiku, Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie.', 'Klinika Hematoonkologii i Transplantacji Szpiku, Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie.']",['pol'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131125,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/05/30 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1077467 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1077467 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2013 Nov 25;67:1083-9. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1077467.,,,,,,,,Ostra bialaczka promielocytowa--nowe podejscie do patogenezy choroby i terapii roznicujacej.,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDD knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced apoptosis in A2780ip2, OVCAR5 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells, correlating with loss of the prosurvival protein myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) through a glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta-independent mechanism. SiRNA to EDD or Mcl-1 induced comparable levels of apoptosis in A2780ip2 and ES-2 cells. Stable overexpression of Mcl-1 protected cells from apoptosis following EDD knockdown, accompanied by a loss of endogenous, but not exogenous, Mcl-1 protein, suggesting that EDD regulated Mcl-1 synthesis. Indeed, EDD knockdown induced a 1.87-fold decrease in Mcl-1 messenger RNA and EDD transfection enhanced murine Mcl-1 promoter-driven luciferase expression 5-fold. To separate EDD survival and potential cisplatin resistance functions, we generated EDD shRNA stable cell lines that could survive initial EDD knockdown and showed that these cells were 4- to 21-fold more sensitive to cisplatin. Moreover, transient EDD overexpression in COS-7 cells was sufficient to promote cisplatin resistance 2.4-fold, dependent upon its E3 ligase activity. In vivo, mouse intraperitoneal ES-2 and A2780ip2 xenograft experiments showed that mice treated with EDD siRNA by nanoliposomal delivery [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophatidylcholine (DOPC)] and cisplatin had significantly less tumor burden than those treated with control siRNA/DOPC alone (ES-2, 77.9% reduction, P = 0.004; A2780ip2, 75.9% reduction, P = 0.042) or control siRNA/DOPC with cisplatin in ES-2 (64.4% reduction, P = 0.035), with a trend in A2780ip2 (60.3% reduction, P = 0.168).

The genetic association studies (GASs) that have investigated the association between adult CML and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms have produced contradictory and inconclusive results. The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide a relatively comprehensive assessment of the association of these polymorphisms with adult CML risk. A literature search for eligible GAS published before September 15, 2013 was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of the association under a fixed or random effect model according to heterogeneity test results. All analyses were performed using the Stata software, version 12.0. Twelve case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 932 CML patients and 3,465 healthy controls. For MTHFR C677T (dbSNP: rs1801133, C>T), though the pooled ORs were not significant in the overall population, all the ORs greater than 1 suggested an increased risk of CML for carriers of the risk allele. However, stratified analysis based on genotyping method revealed a significant association in the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) subgroup, possibly as a result of heterogeneity. For MTHFR A1298C (dbSNP: rs1801131, A>C), the combined results showed that carriers of the C allele may be associated with a decreased risk of adult CML. Stratified analysis showed that the magnitude of this effect was especially significant among Asians, indicating ethnicity differences in adult CML susceptibility. This meta-analysis shows that the C allele of MTHFR A1298C may be associated with a decreased risk in adult CML, especially among Asians, while MTHFR C677T may not be associated with adult CML risk. However, the development of adult CML may be the result of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, which should be considered in future individual GAS and subsequent meta-analyses.","['Li, Bin', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Wang, Lei', 'Li, Yan', 'Jin, Juping', 'Ai, Limei', 'Li, Chong', 'Li, Zhe', 'Mao, Shudan']","['Li B', 'Zhang J', 'Wang L', 'Li Y', 'Jin J', 'Ai L', 'Li C', 'Li Z', 'Mao S']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning Medical University, No. 2 Renmin Street, Jinzhou, 121001, Liaoning, China, libinlnmu@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20131231,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1554-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 May;35(5):4233-45. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1554-9.

Furthermore, the upregulation of transcription factors including CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (CEBPalpha, beta, epsilon) and PU.1, which are known to be critical factors for normal myelopoiesis, granulocytic maturation and being repressed in APL, concurred with the differentiation induction. A significant cell growth inhibition was observed after the treatment with VPA, which was further strengthened by the addition of ATRA. Given the importance of C/EBPs and PU.1 in myeloid development, these results, thus, suggest that restoration of the normal function of the myeloid cell transcriptional machinery is a major molecular mechanism underlying the differentiation induction in NB4.

The analysis of azacitidine in biological samples is subject to interference by endogenous compounds. Previously reported high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) bioanalytical assays for azacitidine suffer from expensive sample preparation procedures or from long separation times to achieve the required selectivity. Herein, supercritical fluid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) was explored as a more promising technique for the selective analysis of structure-like or chiral drugs in biological matrices. In this study, a simple, rapid and specific SFC/MS/MS analytical method was developed for the determination of azacitidine levels in rat plasma. Azacitidine was completely separated from the endogenous compounds on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mmx3.0 mm, 1.7 mum; Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) using isocratic elution with CO2/methanol as the mobile phase. The single-run analysis time was as short as 3.5 min. The sample preparation for protein removal was accomplished using a simple methanol precipitation method. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of azacitidine was 20 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 15%, and the relative error (RE) was within +/-15% for the medium- and high-concentration quality control (QC) samples and within +/-20% for the low-concentration QC samples. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats following the intravenous administration of azacitidine.","['Li, Dongpo', 'Zhang, Tianhong', 'Kou, Longfa', 'Zhang, Youxi', 'Sun, Jin', 'He, Zhonggui']","['Li D', 'Zhang T', 'Kou L', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun J', 'He Z']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110016, China. ldcover@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110016, China. pharmazhang@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110016, China. klf.666666@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110016, China. zyx5131410@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110016, China. sunjin66@21cn.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110016, China. hezhonggui@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131227,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'Q3JTX2Q7TU (Diazepam)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', '*Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid/methods', 'Diazepam/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Stability', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods']",PMC6271376,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules19010342 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules19010342 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2013 Dec 27;19(1):342-51. doi: 10.3390/molecules19010342.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MMP-9 is secreted in both the monomeric and dimeric form. Although there is little research on MMP-9 dimers, some studies have shown the dimer to be associated with more aggressive tumor progression. Our objective was to study the relative secretion patterns of MMP-9 monomer and dimer in a variety of cancer cell lines and the effect of a nutrient mixture (NM) containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid and green tea extract on MMP-9 secretion. The cancer cell lines were grown in their respective media, supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 microg/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates. At near confluence, the cells were treated with NM at 0,10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 microg/ml. Parallel sets of cultures were treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for induction of MMP-9. Cell MMP-9 secretion was assayed by gelatinase zymography. MMP-9 dimer secretion patterns of cancer cells fell into different categories. We observed no MMP-9 dimer in prostate DU-145 and PC-3, pancreatic MIA-Pa-Ca2, colon HCT-116, bladder T-24, head and neck FaDu, glioblastoma A-172, T-98 and LN-18 and leukemia HL-60, Jurkat, and Raji cell lines. MMP-dimer secretion only with PMA induction was seen in breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, uterine SK-UT-1, lung A-549, tongue SC-25, melanoma A2058, osteosarcoma U-2OS, rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma HT-1080, chondrosarcoma SW-1350 and liposarcoma SW-872. Cervical HeLa and DoTc 2 4510, renal 786-0 and HCC SK-Hep-1 cells exhibited MMP-9 dimer without PMA treatment and increased secretion with PMA treatment. Sarcomas had the highest levels of MMP-9 monomer and dimer with and without PMA among these cancer cell lines. Cervical, uterine and male breast cancer cell lines showed the next highest levels of MMP-9, followed by breast cancer cell lines. Melanoma, renal, lung, head and neck and HCC showed lower levels and prostate, glioblastoma, bladder and leukemia cell lines the lowest. NM showed dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 monomer and dimer in all cell lines tested. In conclusion, high MMP-9 and dimer secretion levels correlated with the most aggressive cancer cell lines. NM was effective in inhibiting MMP-9 and dimer secretion in all cell lines tested, suggesting its therapeutic potential as an antimetastatic agent.","['Roomi, M W', 'Kalinovsky, T', 'Rath, M', 'Niedzwiecki, A']","['Roomi MW', 'Kalinovsky T', 'Rath M', 'Niedzwiecki A']","['Dr. Rath Research Institute, 1260 Memorex Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95050, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, 1260 Memorex Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95050, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, 1260 Memorex Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95050, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, 1260 Memorex Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95050, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131230,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', '*Dimerization', 'Gelatinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysine/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proline/pharmacology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/biosynthesis']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.2235 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Mar;44(3):986-92. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.2235.

Twenty-two patients with MDS (median age, 77.5 yr [interquartile range, 69-81]; 10 women) were included. Inflammatory arthritis presented as polyarthritis in 17 cases (77%) and with symmetric involvement in 15 cases (68%). At diagnosis, the median disease activity score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) was 4.5 [2-6.5]. Two patients had anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), and 1 had radiologic erosions. The median time between the diagnoses of arthritis and MDS was 10 months [6-42], with a median articular symptom duration of 3 months [2-8]. The diagnosis of both diseases was concomitant in 6 cases (27%); arthritis preceded MDS in 12 cases (55%), and occurred after MDS in 4 (18%). While the number of swollen and tender joints significantly decreased during follow-up, as did the median DAS28-CRP (from 4.3 [3.8-4.6] at baseline to 2.9 [1.75-3.3]; p < 0.05), CRP remained elevated (CRP >20 mg/L) in 8 patients (42%). Nevertheless, radiographic progression and new ACPA positivity were not observed during a median follow-up of 29 months [9-76]. While most of the patients were treated with steroids (n = 16) for arthritis, additional treatment was administered in only 4 patients (hydroxychloroquine, n = 2; sulfasalazine [Salazopyrin] and etanercept, n = 1, respectively). Eleven patients died during follow-up from acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5); infections (n = 3); or cerebral bleeding, cardiorespiratory failure, or undetermined cause (n = 1, respectively). Inflammatory arthritis associated with MDS can have various presentations and is often seronegative and nonerosive. Steroids alone are the most common treatment in MDS-associated arthritis, but that treatment is insufficient to control arthritis. Steroid-sparing strategies need to be identified.","['Mekinian, Arsene', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Decaux, Olivier', 'Falgarone, Geraldine', 'Toussirot, Eric', 'Raffray, Loic', 'Omouri, Mohamed', 'Gombert, Bruno', 'De Wazieres, Benoit', 'Buchdaul, Anne-Laure', 'Ziza, Jean-Marc', 'Launay, David', 'Denis, Guillaume', 'Madaule, Serge', 'Rose, Christian', 'Grignano, Eric', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Fain, Olivier']","['Mekinian A', 'Braun T', 'Decaux O', 'Falgarone G', 'Toussirot E', 'Raffray L', 'Omouri M', 'Gombert B', 'De Wazieres B', 'Buchdaul AL', 'Ziza JM', 'Launay D', 'Denis G', 'Madaule S', 'Rose C', 'Grignano E', 'Fenaux P', 'Fain O']","[""From the Service de medecine interne (AM, EG, OF), Universite Paris 13, AP-HP, Hopital Jean Verdier, Bondy; Service d'hematologie clinique (TB, PF), Universite Paris 13, AP-HP, Avicenne, Bobigny; Service de medecine interne (OD), Universite Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes; Service de rhumatologie (GF), Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris 13, Li2P, EA4222, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny; Centre Investigation Clinique Biotherapie CBT-506 & Service de rhumatologie (ET), CHU Besancon, Besancon; Service de medecine interne (LR), CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux; Service de rhumatologie (MO), CH Romilly/Seine; Service de medecine interne (BG), Hopital de La Rochelle, La Rochelle; Service de medecine interne et geriatrique (BDW), CHU Nimes, Nimes; Service de medecine interne (A-LB), CH Douai, Douai; Service de rhumatologie (J-MZ), CH Croix Saint Simon, Paris; Service de medecine interne (DL), CHU Lille, Universite Lille II, Lille; Service de medecine interne (GD), Hopital de Rochefort, Rochefort; Service de medecine interne (SM), CHG Albi, Albi; and Service d'hematologie clinique (CR), Hopital Saint-Vincent de Paul, UC Lille, Univ Nord de France, Lille; France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/epidemiology', 'Polymyalgia Rheumatica/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4616329,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000011 [doi]', '00005792-201401000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2014 Jan;93(1):1-10. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000011.,,,,,,,,,"['Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation (CRI), Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies', '(GFM), and Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI)']",,,,,,,,,,,

There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration approved therapies for all MDS/MPN subtypes. Advances in the understanding of the biologic and molecular drivers of these diseases will help in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. This review article summarizes the molecular aspects of MDS/MPNs and provides an overview of classic and emerging therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Next generation sequencing has provided new insights into the genetic nature of MDS/MPNs. Molecular mutations such as TET2, CBL, SETBP1, CSF3R, and SF3B1 are relevant as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Hematopoietic cell transplantation, although potentially curative, is applicable to only a small proportion of patients. Attempts to standardize response and outcomes criteria specific to MDS/MPN and clinical trials using novel agents focused on MDS/MPN patients are underway. SUMMARY: MDS/MPNs have clinicopathologic features of both MDS and MPN diseases. Emerging molecular data support the distinctive disease biology of each of these morphologic entities, and will serve as the foundation to develop effective therapeutics that can ameliorate disease-related complications and lead to better outcomes.","['Tiu, Ramon V', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Tiu RV', 'Sekeres MA']","['aDepartment of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research bCleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute cLeukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA *Both authors contributed equally to the writing of this article.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000021 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):131-40. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review examines features that define increased risk of treatment failure in APL, and summarizes strategies that are currently available to minimize that risk. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last few years, a targeted approach has progressively been adopted in the initial therapy of APL, with increasing reliance on the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The goals of treatment are to minimize early and late disease-related and therapy-related complications, and to ultimately eliminate relapses and resistant disease entirely. The relative contributions of treatment-induced terminal differentiation and leukemia-specific fusion protein degradation in the elimination of APL have also been clarified. SUMMARY: High-risk APL, traditionally defined by an initial white cell count exceeding 10 x 10(9)/l, has proven to be almost as amenable to disease eradication as low-risk and intermediate-risk APL, provided treatment includes ATRA, ATO and some chemotherapy. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of APL and the associated coagulopathy has the potential to further minimize the risk of failure by reducing induction deaths and relapses.","['Iland, Harry J', 'Seymour, John F', 'Wei, Andrew']","['Iland HJ', 'Seymour JF', 'Wei A']","['aRoyal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown bUniversity of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales cPeter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne dUniversity of Melbourne eThe Alfred Hospital fMonash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000025 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):102-13. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A human monocytic cell line THP-1 which, upon phorbol ester treatment, is differentiated into macrophages, has previously been used to study virulence strategies of many intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we discuss a protocol to enact an in vitro cell culture model system using THP-1 macrophages to delineate the interaction of an opportunistic human yeast pathogen Candida glabrata with host phagocytic cells. This model system is simple, fast, amenable to high-throughput mutant screens, and requires no sophisticated equipment. A typical THP-1 macrophage infection experiment takes approximately 24 hr with an additional 24-48 hr to allow recovered intracellular yeast to grow on rich medium for colony forming unit-based viability analysis. Like other in vitro model systems, a possible limitation of this approach is difficulty in extrapolating the results obtained to a highly complex immune cell circuitry existing in the human host. However, despite this, the current protocol is very useful to elucidate the strategies that a fungal pathogen may employ to evade/counteract antimicrobial response and survive, adapt, and proliferate in the nutrient-poor environment of host immune cells.","['Rai, Maruti Nandan', 'Borah, Sapan', 'Bairwa, Gaurav', 'Balusu, Sriram', 'Gorityala, Neelima', 'Kaur, Rupinder']","['Rai MN', 'Borah S', 'Bairwa G', 'Balusu S', 'Gorityala N', 'Kaur R']","['Laboratory of Fungal Pathogenesis, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Andhra Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20131210,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Candida glabrata/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/*cytology/immunology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mycology/*methods', 'Virulence']",PMC4047927,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/50625 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2013 Dec 10;(82):e50625. doi: 10.3791/50625.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moving down the dose range to the vicinity of 100-200 mSv, the risks become fuzzy and then unknown at low doses on the order of 10-20 mSv. Nor have low-dose experimental studies provided definitive answers: some have suggested there may be adverse biological effects in the range of 5-50 mSv, while others support a ""no risk"" interpretation. Epidemiologic data contain intrinsic ""noise"" (variation by known and unknown factors related to genetics, lifestyle, other environmental exposures, sociodemographics, diagnostic accuracy, etc.) so are generally too insensitive to provide compelling answers in the low-dose range. However, there have been recent provocative reports regarding risk from relatively low-dose occupational and medical radiation exposures that warrant careful consideration. Summaries of the largest studies with low-dose or low dose-rate radiation exposure provide suggestive evidence of risk for solid cancer and stronger evidence for leukemia risk. Recently, interest in health endpoints other than cancer also has risen sharply, in particular the degree of cardiovascular and cataract risk following doses under 1 Sv. Data regarding cardiovascular disease are limited and fuzzy, with suggestions of inconsistencies, and the risk at low doses is essentially unknown. The evidence of cataract risk after low dose-rate exposures among those conducting interventional medical radiological procedures is becoming strong. The magnitude of radiation impacts on human health requires fuller documentation, especially for low-dose or low dose-rate exposures. From the epidemiologic vantage point, this will require longer observation of existing irradiated cohorts and development of new informative cohorts, improved accuracy in dose assessments, more attention to confounding variables, and more biosamples from irradiated groups to enable translational radiobiological studies.

However, its precise mechanism of action in myeloid leukemia cells is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of 6G on myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study showed that 6G inhibited proliferation of myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary myeloid leukemia cells while sparing the normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies using U937 and K562 cell lines revealed that 6G treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory complex I (MRC I), which in turn increased the expression of the oxidative stress response-associated microRNA miR-27b and DNA damage. Elevated miR-27b expression inhibited PPARgamma, with subsequent inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine gene expression associated with the oncogenic NF-kappaB pathway, whereas the increased DNA damage led to G2/M cell cycle arrest. The 6G induced effects were abolished in the presence of anti-miR-27b or the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. In addition, the results of the in vivo xenograft experiments in mice indicated that 6G treatment inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, in agreement with the in vitro studies. Our data provide new evidence that 6G-induced myeloid leukemia cell death is initiated by reactive oxygen species and mediated through an increase in miR-27b expression and DNA damage. The dual induction of increased miR-27b expression and DNA damage-associated cell cycle arrest by 6G may have implications for myeloid leukemia treatment.","['Rastogi, Namrata', 'Gara, Rishi Kumar', 'Trivedi, Rachana', 'Singh, Akanksha', 'Dixit, Preety', 'Maurya, Rakesh', 'Duggal, Shivali', 'Bhatt, M L B', 'Singh, Sarika', 'Mishra, Durga Prasad']","['Rastogi N', 'Gara RK', 'Trivedi R', 'Singh A', 'Dixit P', 'Maurya R', 'Duggal S', 'Bhatt ML', 'Singh S', 'Mishra DP']","['Endocrinology Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.', 'Endocrinology Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.', 'Endocrinology Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.', 'Medicinal and Process Chemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.', 'Medicinal and Process Chemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.', 'Medicinal and Process Chemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, CSM Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226003, India.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, CSM Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226003, India.', 'Toxicology Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226001, India.', 'Endocrinology Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh 226021, India.

However, epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, deregulate gene expression and may also have prognostic impact. We evaluated the clinical relevance of integrating DNA methylation and genetic information in AML. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing analysis of methylated DNA identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with prognostic mutations in older (>/= 60 years) cytogenetically normal (CN) patients with AML (n = 134). Genes with promoter DMRs and expression levels significantly associated with outcome were used to compute a prognostic gene expression weighted summary score that was tested and validated in four independent patient sets (n = 355). RESULTS: In the training set, we identified seven genes (CD34, RHOC, SCRN1, F2RL1, FAM92A1, MIR155HG, and VWA8) with promoter DMRs and expression associated with overall survival (OS; P </= .001). Each gene had high DMR methylation and lower expression, which were associated with better outcome. A weighted summary expression score of the seven gene expression levels was computed. A low score was associated with a higher complete remission (CR) rate and longer disease-free survival and OS (P < .001 for all end points). This was validated in multivariable models and in two younger (< 60 years) and two older independent sets of patients with CN-AML. Considering the seven genes individually, the fewer the genes with high expression, the better the outcome. Younger and older patients with no genes or one gene with high expression had the best outcomes (CR rate, 94% and 87%, respectively; 3-year OS, 80% and 42%, respectively). CONCLUSION: A seven-gene score encompassing epigenetic and genetic prognostic information identifies novel AML subsets that are meaningful for treatment guidance.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Yan, Pearlly', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Frankhouser, David', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Bucci, Donna', 'Curfman, John P', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Mendler, Jason H', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Bar, Constance', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Byrd, John C', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Bundschuh, Ralf', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Yan P', 'Maharry K', 'Frankhouser D', 'Nicolet D', 'Metzeler KH', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Mrozek K', 'Wu YZ', 'Bucci D', 'Curfman JP', 'Whitman SP', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Mendler JH', 'Schwind S', 'Becker H', 'Bar C', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Wetzler M', 'Carter TH', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Byrd JC', 'Plass C', 'Garzon R', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Stone RM', 'Volinia S', 'Bundschuh R', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Guido Marcucci, Pearlly Yan, Kati Maharry, David Frankhouser, Deedra Nicolet, Klaus H.

High LEF1 expression has been reported as a prognostic marker in hematologic malignancies. We evaluated the prognostic significance of LEF1 expression in 78 adult acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. APL samples were dichotomized at the median value and divided into: LEF1(low) and LEF1(high). LEF1(high) patients had lower WBC counts at baseline and were less likely to carry a FLT3-ITD than LEF1(low) patients. Early death occurred only in the LEF1(low) group. Moreover, LEF1(low) expression was associated with a high Sanz score. Survival analysis of 61 APL patients < 60 years revealed that the LEF1(high) group had a significantly longer overall survival (OS). Cox analysis for OS confirmed only LEF1 expression as an independent prognostic factor. Of the 17 patients over the age of 60, those in the LEF1(high) group showed a higher median survival. In silico analysis identified 9 differentially expressed, up-modulated genes associated with a high expression of LEF1; the majority of these genes is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Our study provides evidence that LEF1 expression is an independent prognostic factor in APL, and could be used in patients risk stratification.","['Albano, Francesco', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Orsini, Paola', 'Minervini, Crescenzio Francesco', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Tota, Giuseppina', 'Brunetti, Claudia', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Mestice, Anna', 'Cellamare, Angelo', 'Specchia, Giorgina']","['Albano F', 'Zagaria A', 'Anelli L', 'Orsini P', 'Minervini CF', 'Impera L', 'Casieri P', 'Coccaro N', 'Tota G', 'Brunetti C', 'Minervini A', 'Pastore D', 'Carluccio P', 'Mestice A', 'Cellamare A', 'Specchia G']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Young Adult']",PMC3996670,2014/01/01 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1619 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.1619 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Feb 15;5(3):649-58. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.1619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, few studies have been focused on postmortem BM morphological changes after pathological stimuli. We examined 73 BM samples from forensic autopsies; causes of death were both natural and traumatic. BM samples were collected from the sternum by needle aspiration and biopsy; in selected cases, immunohistochemistry was performed. Few autolytic changes were found; BM cellularity decreased with increasing age and postmortem interval. Notable cell changes were detected in 45 cases (61.64%): neoplastic (n=4), and non-neoplastic BM findings (n=41), including multiorgan failure/sepsis (n=26), myelodisplastic-like conditions (n=11), and anaphylactic reactions (n=4). The results showed that BM cellularity supported circumstantial and autopsy findings, suggesting that BM samples could be a useful tool in forensic science applications.","['Tattoli, Lucia', 'Tsokos, Michael', 'Sautter, Julia', 'Anagnostopoulos, Joannis', 'Maselli, Eloisa', 'Ingravallo, Giuseppe', 'Delia, Mario', 'Solarino, Biagio']","['Tattoli L', 'Tsokos M', 'Sautter J', 'Anagnostopoulos J', 'Maselli E', 'Ingravallo G', 'Delia M', 'Solarino B']","['Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Bari, P.zza G.

The tumor can affect any part of the body. Involvement of the oral cavity and nasopharynx has been reported in 50 cases. We report a case describing myeloid sarcoma affecting the lateral pharyngeal wall. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old Arabian man who had acute biphenotypic leukemia treated with chemoradiation and allogeneic stem cell transplant was referred to our department with sore throat and a mass lesion in his lateral pharyngeal wall after failed antibiotic therapy. Biopsy of his lesion revealed myeloid sarcoma. He was referred to the Department of Hematology-Oncology for further evaluation that showed no other lesions.The patient was diagnosed with isolated extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of his lateral pharyngeal wall as a relapse of acute biphenotypic leukemia and managed with chemoradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid sarcoma of the pharynx is a rarely encountered malignancy in the practice of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. It can develop de novo, but may also represent relapse of leukemia. Thus, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any pharyngeal lesions in patients with leukemia.","['Alrumaih, Redha', 'Saleem, Muhammad', 'Velagapudi, Suresh', 'Dababo, Mohammad Anas']","['Alrumaih R', 'Saleem M', 'Velagapudi S', 'Dababo MA']","['Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery and Communication Sciences, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ra_rumaih@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131230,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC3880180,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/01/01 06:01,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-7-292 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-7-292 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2013 Dec 30;7:292. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-292.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recently reported gamaretrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) has been reported to be detected in prostate cancer. However, this virus has not been detected in similar groups of patients in other studies. Herein, we sought to detect XMRV in prostate cancers and benign controls in Sanandaj, west of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a case-control study, genomic DNA was extracted from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded prostate tissues from a total of 163 Iranian patients. We developed a conventional and a nested PCR assay using primers targeting to an env specific sequence of XMRV. PCR assays were carried out on 63 prostate cancers and 100 benign prostate hyperplasias. RESULTS: Beta-actin sequences were successfully detected in the DNA extracts from all prostate tissues, confirming DNA extraction integrity. We did not detect XMRV in samples either from prostate cancers or benign prostate hyperplasias using XMRV specific primers.

A wide range of variation in frequency of KRAS mutations has been seen in hematologic malignancies. Despite this, RAS roles in leukemogenesis remain unclear. The frequency of KRAS mutations in CML has been reported to be between zero an 10%. Many attempts have been done to develop an anti-RAS drug as a therapeutic target. . MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross sectional study was performed in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran from 2010-2012. In 78 CML patients (diagnosed according to WHO 2008 criteria) in chronic or accelerated phases, KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were analyzed using a modified PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. RESULTS: We did not detect any KRAS mutations in this study. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutations are overall rare in early phase CML and might be secondary events happening late in leukemogenesis cooperating with initial genetic lesions.","['Kooshyar, Mohammad Mahdi', 'Ayatollahi, Hossein', 'Keramati, Mohammad Reza', 'Sadeghian, Mohammad Hadi', 'Miri, Mohsen', 'Sheikhi, Maryam']","['Kooshyar MM', 'Ayatollahi H', 'Keramati MR', 'Sadeghian MH', 'Miri M', 'Sheikhi M']","['Hematology Department, Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran E-mail : keramatimr@mums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Young Adult', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2014/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.11.6653 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014 Jan;14(11):6653-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.11.6653.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, it is extremely urgent to explore new therapeutic strategies directly targeting LSCs for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) therapy. We show here that Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a major active component in Dong quai (Chinese Angelica sinensis), effectively inhibited human AML CD34+CD38? cell proliferation in vitro culture in a dose-dependent manner while sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells at physiologically achievable concentrations. Furthermore, ASP exerted cytotoxic effects on AML K562 cells, especially LSC-enriched CD34+CD38? cells. Colony formation assays further showed that ASP significantly suppressed the formation of colonies derived from AML CD34+CD38? cells but not those from normal CD34+CD38? cells. Examination of the underlying mechanisms revealed that ASP induced CD34+CD38? cell senescence, which was strongly associated with a series of characteristic events, including up-regulation of p53, p16, p21, and Rb genes and changes of related cell cycle regulation proteins P16, P21, cyclin E and CDK4, telomere end attrition as well as repression of telomerase activity.

However, results were conflicting. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for the MTHFRC677T polymorphism and ALL risk. METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed and the Chinese Biomedicine database were conducted to select case-control studies containing available genotype frequencies of C677T and the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of any association. RESULTS: Case-control studies including 6,371 cases and 10,850 controls were identified. The meta-analysis stratified by ethnicity showed that individuals with the homozygous TT genotype had decreased risk of ALL (OR= 0.776, 95% CI: 0.687~0.877, p< 0.001) in Caucasians (OR= 0.715, 95% CI: 0.655~0.781, p= 0.000).

The cumulative evidence includes, for example, descriptive observations of a peculiar peak incidence at age 2-5 years for ALL in economically developed countries, clustering of cases in situations of population mixing associated with unusual patterns of personal contacts, associations with various proxy measures for immune modulatory exposures early in life, and genetic susceptibility conferred by variation in genes involved in the immune system. In this review, our focus is the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC), an approximately 7.6 Mb region that is well-known for its high-density of expressed genes, extensive polymorphisms exhibiting complex linkage disequilibrium patterns, and its disproportionately large number of immune-related genes, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA). First discovered through the role they play in transplant rejection, the classical HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and class II (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP) molecules reside at the epicenter of the immune response pathways and are now the targets of many disease susceptibility studies, including those for childhood leukemia. The genes encoding the HLA molecules are only a minority of the over 250 expressed genes in the xMHC, and a growing number of studies are beginning to evaluate other loci through targeted investigations or utilizing a mapping approach with a comprehensive screen of the entire region. Here, we review the current epidemiologic evidence available to date regarding genetic variation contained within this highly unique region of the genome and its relationship with childhood ALL risk.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Thompson, Pamela D', 'Taylor, Malcolm', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth A', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P']","['Urayama KY', 'Thompson PD', 'Taylor M', 'Trachtenberg EA', 'Chokkalingam AP']","[""School of Public Health, University of California , Berkeley, CA , USA ; Center for Clinical Epidemiology, St. Luke's Life Science Institute , Tokyo , Japan."", ""Cancer Immunogenetics, St. Mary's Hospital, University of Manchester , Manchester , UK."", 'Handforth , Cheshire , UK.', ""Center for Genetics, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute , Oakland, CA , USA."", 'School of Public Health, University of California , Berkeley, CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131212,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC3859964,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/01/01 06:01,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00300 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Dec 12;3:300. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00300.,,,,"['P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood leukemia', 'epidemiology', 'genetic susceptibility', 'human leukocyte antigen', 'major histocompatibility complex']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idelalisib, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor causes rapid lymph node shrinkage, along with an increase in lymphocytosis, prior to inducing objective responses in CLL patients. This characteristic activity presumably is due to CLL cell redistribution from tissues into the blood, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We therefore analyzed idelalisib effects on CLL cell adhesion to endothelial and bone marrow stromal cells (EC, BMSC). We found that idelalisib inhibited CLL cell adhesion to EC and BMSC under static and shear flow conditions. TNFalpha-induced VCAM-1 (CD106) expression in supporting layers increased CLL cell adhesion and accentuated the inhibitory effect of idelalisib. Co-culture with EC and BMSC also protected CLL from undergoing apoptosis, and this EC- and BMSC-mediated protection was antagonized by idelalisib. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CLL cell adhesion to EC and VLA-4 (CD49d) resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt, which was sensitive to inhibition by idelalisib. These findings demonstrate that idelalisib interferes with integrin-mediated CLL cell adhesion to EC and BMSC, providing a novel mechanism to explain idelalisib-induced redistribution of CLL cells from tissues into the blood.","['Fiorcari, Stefania', 'Brown, Wells S', 'McIntyre, Bradley W', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Maffei, Rossana', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Hoellenriegel, Julia', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Ding, Wei', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Lannutti, Brian J', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Fiorcari S', 'Brown WS', 'McIntyre BW', 'Estrov Z', 'Maffei R', ""O'Brien S"", 'Sivina M', 'Hoellenriegel J', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Ding W', 'Kay NE', 'Lannutti BJ', 'Marasca R', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America ; Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Inc.

IDH1 mutations are significant in both diagnosis and prognosis of these conditions. In the present study we determined the prevalence and clinical significance of IDH1 mutations in 349 samples from newly diagnosed AML patients. RESULTS: Of the 349 AML patient specimens analyzed, 35 (10.03%) were found to have IDH1 mutations including 4 IDH1 R132 mutations and 31 non-R132 mutations. IDH1 non-R132 mutations were largely concentrated within AML-M1 (35.72%, p<0.01). We identified five IDH1 mutations that were novel to AML: (1) c.299 G>A, p.R100Q; (2) c.311G>T, p.G104V; (3) c.322T>C, p.F108L; (4) c.356G>A, p.R119Q; and (5) c.388A>G, p.I130V. In addition, we identified three IDH1 mutations that were previously described in AML. The frequency of IDH1 mutations in AML patients with normal karyotype was 9.9%. IDH1 non-R132 mutations were concurrent with mutations in FLT3-ITD (p<0.01), CEBPA (p<0.01), and NRAS (p<0.01), as well as the overexpression of MN1 (p<0.01) and WT1(p<0.01). The overall survival (OS) in the patients with IDH1 non-R132 mutations compared to patients without IDH1 mutations don't reach statistically significance (median 521 days vs median: not reached; n.s.). CONCLUSION: IDH1 non-R132 mutations occurred frequently in newly diagnosed adult Chinese AML patients, and these mutations were associated with genetic alterations. The OS was not influenced by IDH1 non-R132 mutations in the present study.","['Guan, Lixun', 'Gao, Li', 'Wang, Lili', 'Li, Meng', 'Yin, Yue', 'Yu, Li', 'Gao, Chunji']","['Guan L', 'Gao L', 'Wang L', 'Li M', 'Yin Y', 'Yu L', 'Gao C']","['Department of Hematology and Hainan Branch, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Hainan Branch, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Hainan Branch, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Hainan Branch, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Hainan Branch, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Hainan Branch, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

MIWI2, one of the mouse Piwi-like proteins, is expressed in the prepachytene phase of spermatogenesis during the period of de novo methylation. Absence of this protein leads to meiotic defects and a progressive loss of germ cells. There is an accumulation of evidence that Piwi proteins may be active in hematopoietic tissues. Thus, MIWI2 may have a role in hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation, and defects in MIWI2 may lead to abnormal hematopoiesis. MIWI2 mRNA can be detected in a mouse erythroblast cell line by RNA-seq, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of this mRNA causes the cells to take on characteristics of differentiated erythroid precursors. However, there are no detectable hematopoietic abnormalities in a MIWI2-deficient mouse model. While subtle, non-statistically significant changes were noted in the hematopoietic function of mice without a functional MIWI2 gene when compared to wild type mice, our results show that MIWI2 is not solely necessary for hematopoiesis within the normal life span of a mouse.","['Jacobs, James E', 'Wagner, Mark', 'Dhahbi, Joseph', 'Boffelli, Dario', 'Martin, David I K']","['Jacobs JE', 'Wagner M', 'Dhahbi J', 'Boffelli D', 'Martin DI']","[""Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California, United States of America."", ""Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California, United States of America."", ""Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California, United States of America."", ""Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California, United States of America."", ""Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131223,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (PIWIL4 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Aging/pathology', 'Animals', 'Argonaute Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC3871168,2014/01/01 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0082573 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-26900 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 23;8(12):e82573. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082573. eCollection 2013.,,,,['R21 ES016581/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A computerized search of our tertiary medical center's laboratory information system was performed for the 20-year period from 1992 to 2012. All FNAs in children 12 years of age and younger and all related surgical pathology reports were identified. Cytologic and histologic diagnoses were stratified into six diagnostic categories--benign, atypical, suspicious, malignant, cyst contents, and nondiagnostic--and then compared to determine the utility of FNA in this patient population. Four hundred and three FNAs in 389 patients were included in this study, of which there were 288 benign (71.5%), 8 atypical (2.0%), 10 suspicious (2.5%), 42 malignant (10.4%), 12 cyst contents (3.0%), and 43 nondiagnostic (10.6%) cases. The most common benign diagnoses were reactive lymph node and inflammatory infiltrate/abscess, while the most common malignant diagnoses were leukemia/lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. Of the 127 FNAs (31.5%) with histologic follow-up, we identified just one false positive and one false negative case. Like FNA in adults, this study shows that the technique is both sensitive (97.2%) and specific (98.5%), and has high positive predictive (97.2%) and negative predictive (98.5%) values for diagnosing malignancy in childhood. As FNA is a simpler, less invasive, and more cost-effective procedure when compared with surgical biopsy, it represents a valuable diagnostic tool in the pediatric population.","['Cole, Cristina D', 'Wu, Howard H']","['Cole CD', 'Wu HH']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131220,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dc.23085 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2014 Jul;42(7):600-5. doi: 10.1002/dc.23085.

PROCEDURES: Patients <18 years with ALL were treated with two consecutive protocols (1995 and 2000). After a steroid prophase, a three-drug induction was administered in protocol 1995, and a four-drug induction, including asparaginase, was administered in protocol 2000. In protocol 2000, a modified BFM phase IB with cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine and cytosine arabinoside was administered to patients at high risk (HR), who also received IV methotrexate (500 mg/m(2)) in the consolidation phase. Reinduction consisted of dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and 6-thioguanine administered over 7 (protocol 1995) or 4 (protocol 2000) weeks; reinduction was repeated twice for patients at HR. Maintenance consisted of p.o. 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, and vincristine and dexamethasone pulses were added in the 2000 study. The total duration of therapy was 24 months. RESULTS: In total, 540 patients were treated. Overall, 7% of patients died during induction, and 9% abandoned treatment. At 5 and 10 years from diagnosis, event-free survival (EFS) rates of 38.1% and 36.6%, respectively, and overall survival rates of 48.0% and 39.6%, respectively, were obtained, considering abandonment as an event. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, a 10-year EFS of 36.6% was achieved in a country with limited resources. Factors limiting a higher success rate were treatment abandonment and a high relapse rate.","['Pacheco, Carlos', 'Lucchini, Giovanna', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Malta, Alberto', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Flores, Andronica', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Tognoni, Gianni', 'Arguello, Mercedes', 'Cavalli, Franco', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Lacayo, Fulgencio Baez', 'Masera, Giuseppe']","['Pacheco C', 'Lucchini G', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Malta A', 'Conter V', 'Flores A', 'Biondi A', 'Tognoni G', 'Arguello M', 'Cavalli F', 'Silvestri D', 'Lacayo FB', 'Masera G']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Manuel de Jesus Rivera Hospital, Managua, Nicaragua.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131227,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'International Cooperation', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Nicaragua', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24871 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):827-32. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24871.

This helps prevent leukemic relapse as well as rejection after transplantation. A myeloablative conditioning regimen with busulfan (BU) or total body irradiation (TBI) is effective for eradication of leukemic cells but is also associated with significant toxicities in the acute or late phase in pediatric patients. In an effort to minimize these adverse effects, we conducted bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from unrelated volunteer donors using a conditioning regimen without BU or TBI. PROCEDURE: Ten patients with acute leukemia in first or second remission were given a ""non-BU, non-TBI conditioning regimen,"" which consisted of fludarabine (FLU), cytarabine (CA), and melphalan (L-PAM) after FLAG combined with L-PAM. RESULTS: Engraftment was obtained in all patients, and two patients died of relapse. Eight of 10 patients have been disease-free for a median of 126 months (116-142) after transplantation. The overall survival, event-free survival, relapse rate, and treatment-related mortality were 80.0%, 80.0%, 20.0% and 0.0%, respectively. In female patients, spontaneous menstruation with normal luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol (E2) levels was observed in all four patients at post-pubertal age. CONCLUSIONS: This conditioning regimen of FLAG combined with L-PAM (which did not contain BU and TBI) was associated with good outcomes and minimal late adverse effects in children with acute leukemia who have undergone allogeneic BMT from unrelated volunteer donors.","['Kato, Koji', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Matsumoto, Kimikazu', 'Matsuyama, Takaharu']","['Kato K', 'Yoshida N', 'Matsumoto K', 'Matsuyama T']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131230,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality/therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/therapy', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24922 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Apr;61(4):712-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24922.

PROCEDURE: In the AHOPCA-ALL 2008 protocol, patients were stratified by age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype, central nervous system involvement, day 8 prednisone response, and morphologic bone marrow response to induction therapy. Patients at Standard Risk (SR) received a three-drug induction regimen, a reinduction phase, and maintenance with protracted intrathecal therapy. Those at Intermediate (IR) and High Risk (HR) received, in addition, daunorubicin during induction therapy, a consolidation phase and two or three reinduction phases respectively. RESULTS: From August 2008 through July 2012, 1,313 patients were enrolled: 353 in SR, 548 in IR, 412 in HR. During induction therapy, 3.0% of patients died, 2.7% abandoned treatment, 1.1% had resistant ALL, and 93.2% achieved morphological complete remission (CR). Deaths and abandonment in first CR occurred in 2.7% and in 7.0% of patients, respectively. The relapse rate at a median observation time of 2.1 years was 15.0%. At 3 years, the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with abandonment considered as an event, were 59.4% (SE 1.7) and 68.2% (SE 1.6). Three-year EFS was 68.5% (SE 3.0), 62.1% (SE 2.6), and 47.8% (SE 3.2) for SR, IR, and HR groups. Adolescents had a significantly higher relapse rate (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This experience shows that common international studies are feasible in lower-middle income countries. Toxic deaths, abandonment of treatment, and relapses remain major obstacles to the successful treatment. Alternative treatment strategies may be beneficial.","['Navarrete, M', 'Rossi, E', 'Brivio, E', 'Carrillo, J M', 'Bonilla, M', 'Vasquez, R', 'Pena, A', 'Fu, L', 'Martinez, R', 'Espinoza, C M Pacheco', 'Lacayo, L F Baez', 'Rodriguez, H', 'Batista, R', 'Barr, R', 'Howard, S C', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Masera, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Conter, V', 'Valsecchi, M G']","['Navarrete M', 'Rossi E', 'Brivio E', 'Carrillo JM', 'Bonilla M', 'Vasquez R', 'Pena A', 'Fu L', 'Martinez R', 'Espinoza CM', 'Lacayo LF', 'Rodriguez H', 'Batista R', 'Barr R', 'Howard SC', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Masera G', 'Biondi A', 'Conter V', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Nacional de Ninos ""Dr. Carlos Saenz Herrera,"", San Jose, Costa Rica.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20131224,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central America', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Poverty', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Withholding Treatment/economics/*statistics & numerical data']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24911 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):803-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24911.

The preferred tool to investigate family expenditure is the retrospective questionnaire, which is subject to recall errors and selection bias. Therefore, in the present study the economic burden of caregiving on families of children and adolescents (0-19 years of age) with cancer was analysed using administrative data as an alternative to retrospective questionnaires. PROCEDURE: Incident cases of cancer diagnosed in children and adolescents in 2000-2005 (N = 917) were identified from the Piedmont Childhood Cancer Registry and linked to available administrative databases to identify episodes of care during the 3 years after diagnosis (N = 13,433). The opportunity cost of informal caregiving was estimated as the value of the time spent by one of the parents, and was assumed to be equal to the number of days during which the child received inpatient care, day-care or outpatient radiotherapy. Factors affecting the level of economic burden of caregiving on families were analysed in a multivariable model. RESULTS: The economic burden of caregiving increased when care was supplied at the Regional Referral Centre, or when treatment complexity was high. Families with younger children had a higher level of economic burden of caregiving. Leukaemia required a higher family commitment than any other cancer considered. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the economic burden of caregiving on families of children and adolescents with cancer derived from administrative data should be considered a minimum burden. The estimated effect of the covariates is informative for healthcare decision-makers in planning support programmes.","['Pagano, Eva', 'Baldi, Ileana', 'Mosso, Maria Luisa', 'di Montezemolo, Luca Cordero', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Merletti, Franco']","['Pagano E', 'Baldi I', 'Mosso ML', 'di Montezemolo LC', 'Fagioli F', 'Pastore G', 'Merletti F']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, ""Citta della Salute e della Scienza"" Hospital, Torino, Italy; Childhood Cancer Registry CPO-Piemonte, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131227,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Absenteeism', 'Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care/economics', 'Cancer Care Facilities/economics', 'Caregivers/*economics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost of Illness', 'Episode of Care', 'Family', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Models, Economic', 'Neoplasms/*economics/therapy', 'Registries', 'Time Factors', 'Travel/economics', 'Unemployment', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24904 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jun;61(6):1088-93. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24904.

Studies in human lymphatic leukemia cell lines have confirmed the anti-angiogenic activity of ADI. Activity and thermal resistance limit the efficacy of ADI in treatment of auxotrophic tumors. Previously, we reengineered ADI from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida (PpADI) for improved activity under physiological conditions (37 degrees C, PBS buffer, pH 7.4) by two rounds of directed evolution and combination of beneficial substitutions through site-directed mutagenesis. The best variant, PpADI M6 (K5T/D38H/D44E/A128T/E296K/H404R), showed a 64.7-fold improvement in k(cat) value and a 37.6% decreased S(0.5) value under physiological conditions. However, M6 lost rapidly its activity (half-life of ~2 days at 37 degrees C). Here we report the re-engineering of PpADI M6 for improved thermal resistance by directed evolution in order to increase its half-life under physiological conditions. Directed evolution and recombination of the two most beneficial positions yielded variant PpADI M9 (K5T/D38H/D44E/A128T/V140L/E296K/F325L/H404R), for which the T(m) value increased from 47 (M6) to 54 degrees C (M9); this corresponds to an increased half-life from ~2 days (M6) to ~3.5 days (M9) under physiological conditions. Structure analysis of the homology model of M9 showed that the beneficial substitutions V140L and F325L likely promote the formation of tetrameric PpADI, which has greater thermal resistance than dimeric PpADI.","['Zhu, Leilei', 'Cheng, Feng', 'Piatkowski, Victoria', 'Schwaneberg, Ulrich']","['Zhu L', 'Cheng F', 'Piatkowski V', 'Schwaneberg U']","['Lehrstuhl fur Biotechnologie, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, 52056 Aachen (Germany).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '29VT07BGDA (Citrulline)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.6 (arginine deiminase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Citrulline/metabolism', 'Directed Molecular Evolution/*methods', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrolases/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', 'Pseudomonas/enzymology/genetics', '*Temperature']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/09/04 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.201300433 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2014 Jan 24;15(2):276-83. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201300433.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) as initial salvage may be effective and potentially superior to conventional salvage chemotherapy. Eighteen percent (285 of 1597) of AML patients were primary refractory to HiDAC-based regimens at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1995 and 2009. AHSCT was the initial salvage in 28 cases. These patients were compared against 149 patients who received salvage chemotherapy, but never received AHSCT. Patients receiving salvage chemotherapy were older, had higher bone marrow blasts percentage, and higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetics (P < 0.001). Median time from induction to AHSCT was 76 days. Objective response was achieved in 23 of 28 patients (82%) undergoing AHSCT. The incidence of grade III/IV acute and chronic graft versus-host-disease was 11% and 29%, respectively. Median follow up for living patients is 80 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 15.7 months and 2.9 months for AHSCT and chemotherapy, respectively (P < 0.001); the 3-year OS rates were 39% and 2%, respectively. ASHCT as initial salvage therapy was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival in multivariate analysis (HR = 3.03; P < 0.001).

Recently, PBX3 was reported to be involved in a variety of cancers, while its implication in gastric cancer is unclear. This study aimed to investigate its clinical significance and biological function in gastric cancer. PBX3 expression was analyzed in 90 gastric cancer specimens using immunohistochemistry. PBX3 was overexpressed in 30 cases (33.33%). Importantly, PBX3 overexpression positively correlated with advanced invasion depth (p = 0.0017), Clinical stage (p = 0.0127) and grade of tumor differentiation (p = 0.0158). PBX3 was also overexpressed in gastric cancer cell lines. Plasmid transfection was performed in AGS and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cell line with low endogenous PBX3 expression. MTT and colony formation assay were carried out to assess the role of PBX3 in proliferation. PBX3 overexpression in gastric cancer cell lines accelerated cell proliferation rate and colony formation ability, with upregulation of PCNA expression. In addition, matrigel invasion assay showed that PBX3 transfection also increased cell-invading ability. These results validate the role of PBX3 as a clinically relevant oncoprotein and establish PBX3 as a promising therapeutic target of gastric cancer.","['Li, Yanke', 'Sun, Zhe', 'Zhu, Zhi', 'Zhang, Junyan', 'Sun, Xu', 'Xu, Huimian']","['Li Y', 'Sun Z', 'Zhu Z', 'Zhang J', 'Sun X', 'Xu H']","[""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, First Hospital of China Medical University, 155 North Nanjing Street, Heping District, Shenyang City, 110001, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131229,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*pathology']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1573-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 May;35(5):4363-8. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1573-6.

In the present work, we explored the expression characteristic of the two kinds of telomere-prolonging mechanisms in the breast cancer tissues per se. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between Her-2 expression and ALT pathway. Ninety samples of breast cancer tissues were examined in this research. RT-PCR was used for the detection of the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT); IHC was used for the detection of the expression of promyelocytic leukemia body (PML) bodies; the co-expression of PML bodies and hTERT was detected using the QDs-based immunofluorescence. The co-expression of PML body and hTERT was found in the same cell in breast cancer tissues, and ten samples expressed neither PML bodies nor hTERT. Additionally, the expression of PML bodies and Her-2 was statistically co-related (P = 0.047). The two kinds of mechanisms of telomere extension can co-exist in the same cell in beast cancer tissues, and there may be other mechanisms of telomere extension functioning in human breast carcinoma.","['Xu, Bin', 'Peng, Min', 'Song, Qibin']","['Xu B', 'Peng M', 'Song Q']","[""Oncology Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430060, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131228,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/analysis', 'Telomerase/*analysis/genetics', '*Telomere', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1534-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 May;35(5):4087-93. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1534-0.

Substantial data indicate that the CD44 adhesion molecule is strongly expressed on AML blasts and that it can also inhibit apoptosis. Our study shows that drug resistance of the AML cell line HL60/ADM is due to overexpression of CD44. In an in vitro study, we knocked down CD44 in the HL60/ADM cell line using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell proliferation and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis and intracellular ADM accumulation were detected by flow cytometry. Expression of CD44, Bcl-2, c-Myc were assayed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The results indicate that the expression of CD44 in HL60/ADM cell line was much higher than in HL60 cell, and siRNA targeted CD44 (siRNA/CD44) could silence its expression in both mRNA and protein levels effectively. siRNA/CD44 substantially induces cell apoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation, enhances susceptibility to ADM and Ara-C, and at the same time increases intracellular ADM accumulation even reverses chemoresistance to ADM and Ara-C. Furthermore, by qRT-PCR and Western blot, we found that siRNA/CD44 decreases Bcl-2 and c-Myc synthesis. Our study provides a novel clue that CD44 plays a significant role in the chemoresistance of AML cells to Ara-C and ADM. Moreover, this provides a new direction to the approaches that combination therapy including targeting CD44 may overcome drug resistance and improve treatment effects.","['Wang, Ni-sha', 'Wei, Min', 'Ma, Wen-li', 'Meng, Wei', 'Zheng, Wen-ling']","['Wang NS', 'Wei M', 'Ma WL', 'Meng W', 'Zheng WL']","['Institute of Genetic Engineering of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131228,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1523-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Apr;35(4):3933-40. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1523-3.

CD34 plays a critical role as a marker for diagnosis and classification of leukemia. Anti CD34 antibodies are used for isolation and purification of HSCs from bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood. OBJECTIVE: To characterize a newly produced monoclonal antibody against a human CD34 peptide. METHODS: Anti CD34 monoclonal antibody (Clone 2C10-D3) was purified from mouse ascitic fluid and hybridoma cell culture supernatants by affinity chromatography and its immune reactivity was examined by ELISA. The purified antibody was further characterized using Western blot and flow cytometry on TF1 (Human Erythroblast) cell line. RESULTS: ELISA experiment revealed that the antibody recognized CD34 peptide. Western blot analysis on TF1 cell lysate confirmed the reactivity of the antibody with a 42 KDa protein. Blocking the antibody with a saturating concentration of specific CD34 peptide resulted in loss of its activity with TF1 lysate in Western blot. The 2C10-D3 antibody reacted with TF1 cells in flow cytometry in a similar manner to a commercial anti CD34 monoclonal antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the anti CD34 monoclonal antibody (Clone 2C10-D3) is an appropriate antibody to study the CD34+ cells by flow cytometry and Western blot.","['Shams, Mahmood', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Notash Haghighat, Farzaneh', 'Bayat, Ali Ahmad', 'Mahmoudian, Jafar', 'Rezvani, Mohammad Reza']","['Shams M', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Notash Haghighat F', 'Bayat AA', 'Mahmoudian J', 'Rezvani MR']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, e-mail: mahmoodshams87@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['07 [pii]', 'IJIv10i4A7 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2013 Dec;10(4):259-66. doi: IJIv10i4A7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Fifty-four cases (31 Osteosarcomas, 14 Ewing sarcomas, and 9 Chondrosarcomas) and 54 healthy controls enrolled in this study. Cases with the history of prior treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) were excluded from the study. Serum levels of sCD30 and sCD40L were detected by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Mean serum concentration of sCD30 in Ewing sarcoma was significantly higher than that of the control groups (p=0.007), but mean serum concentrations of sCD30 in osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma groups were not significantly different, compared to the controls (p=0.41 and p=0.11, respectively).

In patients chronically affected by HCV the prevalence of mixed cryoglobulinemia is variable ranging from 0% to 56%. To verify whether polyomaviruses (PyV) play a role in this disorder a total of 222 blood samples from 63 HCV chronic patients, 43 with mixed cryoglobulinemia, 59 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 50 polytransfused patients, and 50 blood donors were evaluated for Merkel (MCPyV), BKV, JCV, and SV40. EBV was additionally included in the analysis since association with this disorder has been reported. Mixed cryoglobulinemia patients infected chronically with HCV resulted negative for both PyV and EBV.

The prognostic role of its overexpression has been well-studied in leukemias, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in lymphomas. For the first time to our knowledge, we present a study demonstrating the correlation of WT1 expression and survival in various non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We also studied the prognostic implications of WT1 overexpression in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In our sample of 53 patients--25 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 8 with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 9 with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), 2 with Burkitt's lymphoma, 2 with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and 7 with B-cell ALL--, we measured WT1 mRNA from blood samples by quantitative RT-PCR, and divided the patients into subgroups based on the level of expression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn and compared using the logrank test. In the sample of DLBCL patients, the difference in overall and disease-free survival between WT1-positive and negative subgroups was significant (p = 0.0475 and p = 0.0004, respectively), and in a few observed cases, a sudden increase in WT1 expression signified a relapse soon followed by death. Disease-free survival curves in MCL and ALL were similarly suggestive of a potential role played by WT1. In PTCL, though WT1-positivity was detected in 4 out of 9 cases, it did not seem to affect survival. The few cases of MALT and Burkitt's lymphoma all proved to be WT1-negative.","['Ujj, Zsofia', 'Buglyo, Gergely', 'Udvardy, Miklos', 'Vargha, Gyorgy', 'Biro, Sandor', 'Rejto, Laszlo']","['Ujj Z', 'Buglyo G', 'Udvardy M', 'Vargha G', 'Biro S', 'Rejto L']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, 4032, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131228,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-013-9729-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2014 Jul;20(3):565-70. doi: 10.1007/s12253-013-9729-7.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mangiferin on Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling and the sensitivity to etoposide of human myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. METHODS: Human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells and mononuclear human umbilical cord blood cells (MNCs) were examined. Nrf2 protein was detected using immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. Binding of Nrf2 to ARE was examined with electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The level of NQO1 was assessed with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. DCFH-DA was used to evaluate intracellular ROS level. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed using MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Mangiferin (50 mumol/L) significantly increased Nrf2 protein accumulation in HL-60 cells, particularly in the nucleus. Mangiferin also enhanced the binding of Nrf2 to an ARE, significantly up-regulated NQO1 expression and reduced intracellular ROS in HL60 cells. Mangiferin alone dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells. Mangiferin (50 mol/L) did not attenuate etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells, and combined treatment of mangiferin with low concentration of etoposide (0.8 mug/mL) even increased the cell inhibition rate. Nor did mangiferin change the rate of etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In MNCs, mangiferin significantly relieved oxidative stress, but attenuated etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Mangiferin is a novel Nrf2 activator that reduces oxidative stress and protects normal cells without reducing the sensitivity to etoposide of HL-60 leukemia cells in vitro. Mangiferin may be a potential chemotherapy adjuvant.","['Zhang, Ben-ping', 'Zhao, Jie', 'Li, Shan-shan', 'Yang, Li-jing', 'Zeng, Ling-lan', 'Chen, Yan', 'Fang, Jun']","['Zhang BP', 'Zhao J', 'Li SS', 'Yang LJ', 'Zeng LL', 'Chen Y', 'Fang J']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131230,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Xanthones)', '1M84LD0UMD (mangiferin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antioxidant Response Elements/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",PMC4651226,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2013165 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2013.165 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2014 Feb;35(2):257-66. doi: 10.1038/aps.2013.165.

The distinct t(16;21) AML subtype exhibits unique clinical and morphological features and is associated with poor prognosis and a high relapse rate; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. Recently, whole-genome sequencing revealed a large set of genetic alterations that may be relevant for the dynamic clonal evolution and relapse pathogenesis of AML. Here, we report three pediatric AML patients with t(16;21) (p11; q22). The TLS/FUS-ERG fusion transcript was detected in all diagnostic and relapsed samples, with the exception of one relapsed sample. We searched for several genetic lesions, such as RUNX1, FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TP53, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1/2, and DNMT3A, in primary and relapsed AML samples. Interestingly, we found RUNX1 mutation in relapsed sample of one patient in whom cytogenetic analysis showed the emergence of a new additional clone. Otherwise, there were no genetic alterations in FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TP53, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1/2, or DNMT3A. Our results suggest that precedent genetic alterations may be essential to drive the progression and relapse of t(16;21)-AML patients.","['Ismael, Olfat', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Elmahdi, Shaimaa', 'Elshazley, Momen', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Yamada, Miho', 'Yamashita, Yuka', 'Horide, Keizo', 'Kojima, Seiji']","['Ismael O', 'Shimada A', 'Elmahdi S', 'Elshazley M', 'Muramatsu H', 'Hama A', 'Takahashi Y', 'Yamada M', 'Yamashita Y', 'Horide K', 'Kojima S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsuruma-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan, olfat_80@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131228,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1495-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Feb;99(2):169-74. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1495-5.

Gamma-secretase-inhibitor treatment prevents NOTCH1 nuclear localization, but most genes with NOTCH1-binding sites are insensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that fewer than 10% of NOTCH1-binding sites show dynamic changes in NOTCH1 occupancy when T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells are toggled between the Notch-on and -off states with gamma-secretase inhibiters. Dynamic NOTCH1 sites are functional, being highly associated with Notch target genes, are located mainly in distal enhancers, and frequently overlap with RUNX1 binding. In line with the latter association, we show that expression of IL7R, a gene with key roles in normal T-cell development and in T-lymphoblastic leukemia, is coordinately regulated by Runx factors and dynamic NOTCH1 binding to distal enhancers. Like IL7R, most Notch target genes and associated dynamic NOTCH1-binding sites cooccupy chromatin domains defined by constitutive binding of CCCTC binding factor, which appears to restrict the regulatory potential of dynamic NOTCH1 sites. More remarkably, the majority of dynamic NOTCH1 sites lie in superenhancers, distal elements with exceptionally broad and high levels of H3K27ac. Changes in Notch occupancy produces dynamic alterations in H3K27ac levels across the entire breadth of superenhancers and in the promoters of Notch target genes. These findings link regulation of superenhancer function to NOTCH1, a master regulatory factor and potent oncoprotein in the context of immature T cells, and delineate a generally applicable roadmap for identifying functional Notch sites in cellular genomes.","['Wang, Hongfang', 'Zang, Chongzhi', 'Taing, Len', 'Arnett, Kelly L', 'Wong, Yinling Joey', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Liu, X Shirley', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Wang H', 'Zang C', 'Taing L', 'Arnett KL', 'Wong YJ', 'Pear WS', 'Blacklow SC', 'Liu XS', 'Aster JC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131227,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Luciferases', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",PMC3896193,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1315023111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1315023111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 14;111(2):705-10. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1315023111.

In two previous studies we have observed that a 24-h pre-exposure to MF alters cellular responses to menadione-induced DNA damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular changes that must occur already during the first 24h of exposure to MF, and to explore whether the MF-induced changes in DNA damage response can lead to genomic instability in the progeny of the exposed cells. In order to answer these questions, human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to a 50-Hz, 100-muT MF for 24h, followed by 3-h exposure to menadione. The main finding was that MF exposure was associated with increased level of micronuclei, used as an indicator of induced genomic instability, at 8 and 15d after the exposures. Other delayed effects in MF-exposed cells included increased mitochondrial activity at 8d, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation at 15d after the exposures. Oxidative processes (ROS production, reduced glutathione level, and mitochondrial superoxide level) were affected by MF immediately after the exposure. In conclusion, the present results suggest that MF exposure disturbs oxidative balance immediately after the exposure, which might explain our previous findings on MF altered cellular responses to menadione-induced DNA damage. Persistently elevated levels of micronuclei were found in the progeny of MF-exposed cells, indicating induction of genomic instability.","['Luukkonen, Jukka', 'Liimatainen, Anu', 'Juutilainen, Jukka', 'Naarala, Jonne']","['Luukkonen J', 'Liimatainen A', 'Juutilainen J', 'Naarala J']","['Department of Environmental Science, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

However, sensitivity rates vary, probably because of molecular heterogeneity. Acral lentiginous melanomas are characterized by copy number gains of small genomic regions, including CCND1, TERT, and AURKA. In a series of 58 acral melanocytic lesions, we explored the value of a four-color FISH probe, used in addition to determining MYC gene status, and assessed the potential diagnostic usefulness of newly developed probes targeting TERT and AURKA. Moreover, we tested CCND1, TERT, and AURKA protein expression by immunohistochemistry. The four-color FISH probe detected 85.3% of melanomas and 29.4% of TERT and AURKA copy number gains. Sensitivity was 97% (confidence interval 95%, 82.9% to 99.8%) for the combined results of all probes. No MYC copy number gains were detected. No nevi showed aberrations. Immunohistochemistry revealed a higher percentage of cells positive for CCND1, TERT, and AURKA protein in melanomas than in nevi (P </= 0.001). A significant correlation between gene copy number gain and protein expression was found for CCND1 (P = 0.015). Our results indicate that addition of specific FISH probes to the current probe could improve sensitivity for the diagnosis of acral melanomas. Further studies in larger numbers of cases are needed to validate these results.","['Diaz, Alba', 'Puig-Butille, Joan Anton', 'Valera, Alexandra', 'Munoz, Concha', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Garcia-Herrera, Adriana', 'Carrera, Cristina', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Malvehy, Josep', 'Puig, Susana', 'Alos, Llucia']","['Diaz A', 'Puig-Butille JA', 'Valera A', 'Munoz C', 'Costa D', 'Garcia-Herrera A', 'Carrera C', 'Sole F', 'Malvehy J', 'Puig S', 'Alos L']","['Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemical and Molecular Genetics, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Center for Biomedical Network Research on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), the Carlos III Institute of Health (ISCIII), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Biomedical Network Research on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), the Carlos III Institute of Health (ISCIII), Barcelona, Spain; Department of Dermatology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Joseph Carreras Institute for Research against Leukemia, Hospital ""Germans Trias i Pujol"", Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Biomedical Network Research on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), the Carlos III Institute of Health (ISCIII), Barcelona, Spain; Department of Dermatology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Biomedical Network Research on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), the Carlos III Institute of Health (ISCIII), Barcelona, Spain; Department of Dermatology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

Herein, we introduce a novel method for encapsulating proteins into intact RBCs, which was meditated by a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) developed in our lab-low molecular weight protamine (LMWP). l-asparaginase, one of the primary drugs used in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), was chosen as a model protein to illustrate the encapsulation into erythrocytes mediated by CPPs. In addition current treatment of ALL using different l-asparaginase delivery and encapsulation methods as well as their associated problems were also reviewed.","['He, Huining', 'Ye, Junxiao', 'Wang, Yinsong', 'Liu, Quan', 'Chung, Hee Sun', 'Kwon, Young Min', 'Shin, Meong Cheol', 'Lee, Kyuri', 'Yang, Victor C']","['He H', 'Ye J', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Q', 'Chung HS', 'Kwon YM', 'Shin MC', 'Lee K', 'Yang VC']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300072, P.R.

Identification of multiple covalent cytosine modifications raises the question of how these derivatized bases influence stem cell commitment. Using a replicative primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation system, we demonstrate dynamic changes of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) during stem cell commitment and differentiation to the erythroid lineage. Genomic loci that maintain or gain 5-hmC density throughout erythroid differentiation contain binding sites for erythroid transcription factors and several factors not previously recognized as erythroid-specific factors. The functional importance of 5-hmC was demonstrated by impaired erythroid differentiation, with augmentation of myeloid potential, and disrupted 5-hmC patterning in leukemia patient-derived CD34+ stem/early progenitor cells with TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) mutations. Thus, chemical conjugation and affinity purification of 5-hmC-enriched sequences followed by sequencing serve as resources for deciphering functional implications for gene expression during stem cell commitment and differentiation along a particular lineage.","['Madzo, Jozef', 'Liu, Hui', 'Rodriguez, Alexis', 'Vasanthakumar, Aparna', 'Sundaravel, Sriram', 'Caces, Donne Bennett D', 'Looney, Timothy

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our MM database identified 35 CNS MM cases presenting between January 1996 and March 2012. Descriptive analyses were performed on available data on patient characteristics, disease course, and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 55.4 years; 23.5% (n = 8) patients had elevated levels of beta-2-microglobulin > 5.5 mg/L; 68.6% (n = 24) of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (>/= 2 times upper limit of normal); and 14% (n = 5) of patients had secondary plasma cell leukemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was performed in 34 patients, showed diffuse or localized leptomeningeal disease in 20 patients (58.8%). Monoclonal malignant plasma cells were found by CSF analysis in all 35 patients. In total, 31 patients received chemotherapy, including intrathecal chemotherapy as a part of their treatment, with a median survival of 4 months after CNS MM diagnosis. DISCUSSION: In our experience, CNS MM is an aggressive terminal disease feature associated with high beta-2-microglobulin level, high LDH level, and secondary plasma cell leukemia. This study highlights an unmet need in this subset of patients with high-risk, relapsed or refractory MM. CONCLUSION: Achieving adequate CSF penetration while limiting the off-target effects needs to be considered in MM-specific novel drug development.","['Abdallah, Al-ola', 'Atrash, Shebli', 'Shahid, Zainab', 'Jameel, Muzaffar', 'Grazziutti, Monica', 'Apewokin, Senu', 'Kumar, Naveen S', 'Restrepo, Alejandro', 'Waheed, Sarah', 'Van Rhee, Frits', 'Heuck, Christoph J', 'Johann, Donald Jr', 'Barlogie, Bart', 'Usmani, Saad Z']","['Abdallah AO', 'Atrash S', 'Shahid Z', 'Jameel M', 'Grazziutti M', 'Apewokin S', 'Kumar NS', 'Restrepo A', 'Waheed S', 'Van Rhee F', 'Heuck CJ', 'Johann D Jr', 'Barlogie B', 'Usmani SZ']","['Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.

Despite clear correlations between DNA methylation and patient outcome, tests that directly measure multiple-locus DNA methylation are typically expensive and technically challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated that the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia can be predicted by the DNA methylation pattern of 18 loci. We have developed a novel strategy, termed microsphere HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR (MELP), to simultaneously analyze the DNA methylation pattern at these loci using methylation-specific DNA digestion, fluorescently labeled microspheres, and branched DNA hybridization.

We postulated that miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3 might be inactivated by DNA hypermethylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: Methylation of miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3 was studied in eight normal controls including normal bone marrow, buffy coat, and CD19-sorted peripheral blood B-cells from healthy individuals, seven CLL cell lines, and seventy-eight diagnostic CLL samples by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The promoters of miR-9-3 and miR-9-1 were both unmethylated in normal controls, but methylated in five (71.4%) and one of seven CLL cell lines respectively. However, miR-9-2 promoter was methylated in normal controls including CD19 + ve B-cells, hence suggestive of a tissue-specific but not tumor-specific methylation, and thus not further studied. Different MSP statuses of miR-9-3, including complete methylation, partial methylation, and complete unmethylation, were verified by quantitative bisulfite methylation analysis. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment resulted in miR-9-3 promoter demethylation and re-expression of pri-miR-9-3 in I83-E95 and WAC3CD5+ cells, which were homozygously methylated for miR-9-3. Moreover, overexpression of miR-9 led to suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis together with downregulation of NFkappaB1 in I83-E95 cells, supporting a tumor suppressor role of miR-9-3 in CLL. In primary CLL samples, miR-9-3 was detected in 17% and miR-9-1 methylation in none of the patients at diagnosis. Moreover, miR-9-3 methylation was associated with advanced Rai stage (>/= stage 2) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Of the miR-9 family, miR-9-3 is a tumor suppressor miRNA relatively frequently methylated, and hence silenced in CLL; whereas miR-9-1 methylation is rare in CLL. The role of miR-9-3 methylation in the constitutive activation of NFkappaB signaling pathway in CLL warrants further study.","['Wang, Lu Qian', 'Kwong, Yok Lam', 'Kho, Chi Shan Bonnie', 'Wong, Kit Fai', 'Wong, Kwan Yeung', 'Ferracin, Manuela', 'Calin, George A', 'Chim, Chor Sang']","['Wang LQ', 'Kwong YL', 'Kho CS', 'Wong KF', 'Wong KY', 'Ferracin M', 'Calin GA', 'Chim CS']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. jcschim@hku.hk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131227,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC3877874,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-173 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-173 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 Dec 27;12:173. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-173.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Drosophila, Trithorax complexes transmit the memory of active genes to daughter cells through interactions with Trithorax Response Elements (TREs). However, despite their functional importance, nothing is known about sequence features that may act as TREs in mammalian genomic DNA. RESULTS: By analyzing results of reported DNA binding assays, we identified several CpG rich motifs as potential MLL1 binding units (defined as morphemes). We find that these morphemes are dispersed within a relatively large collection of human promoter sequences and appear densely packed near transcription start sites of protein-coding genes. Genome wide analyses localized frequent morpheme occurrences to CpG islands. In the human HOX loci, the morphemes are spread across CpG islands and in some cases tail into the surrounding shores and shelves of the islands. By analyzing results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found a connection between morpheme occurrences, CpG islands, and chromatin segments reported to be associated with MLL1. Furthermore, we found a correspondence of reported MLL1-driven ""bookmarked"" regions in chromatin to frequent occurrences of MLL1 morphemes in CpG islands. CONCLUSION: Our results implicate the MLL1 morphemes in sequence-features that define the mammalian TREs and provide a novel function for CpG islands. Apparently, our findings offer the first evidence for existence of potential TREs in mammalian genomic DNA and the first evidence for a connection between CpG islands and gene-bookmarking by MLL1 to transmit the memory of highly active genes during mitosis. Our results further suggest a role for overlapping morphemes in producing closely packed and multiple MLL1 binding events in genomic DNA so that MLL1 molecules could interact and reside simultaneously on extended potential transcriptional maintenance elements in human chromosomes to transmit the memory of highly active genes during mitosis.","['Bina, Minou', 'Wyss, Phillip', 'Novorolsky, Elise', 'Zulkelfi, Noorfatin', 'Xue, Jing', 'Price, Randi', 'Fay, Matthew', 'Gutmann, Zach', 'Fogler, Brian', 'Wang, Daidong']","['Bina M', 'Wyss P', 'Novorolsky E', 'Zulkelfi N', 'Xue J', 'Price R', 'Fay M', 'Gutmann Z', 'Fogler B', 'Wang D']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA. bina@purdue.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131228,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatin/*genetics/*metabolism', '*CpG Islands', 'DNA/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genome, Human', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics']",PMC3890651,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-14-927 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-14-927 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2013 Dec 28;14:927. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research over the last 10 yr has accumulated evidence that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often altered in human urologic cancers. OBJECTIVE: To review current progress in the biology and implication of lncRNAs associated with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched for articles in the English language with combinations of the Medical Subject Headings terms long non coding RNA, long noncoding RNA, long untranslated RNA, cancer, neoplasms, prostate, bladder, and kidney. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We summarise existing knowledge on the systematics, biology, and function of lncRNAs, particularly these involved in prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer. We also discuss the possible utilisation of lncRNAs as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in urologic malignancies and portray the major challenges and future perspectives of ongoing lncRNA research. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs are important regulators of gene expression interacting with the major pathways of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Alterations in the function of lncRNAs promote tumour formation, progression, and metastasis of prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. LncRNAs can be used as noninvasive tumour markers in urologic malignancies. Increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs perform their function in the normal and malignant cell will lead to a better understanding of tumour biology and could provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of urologic cancers. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this paper we reviewed current knowledge of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for the detection and treatment of urologic cancers. We conclude that lncRNAs can be used as novel biomarkers in prostate, kidney, or bladder cancer. LncRNAs hold promise as future therapeutic targets, but more research is needed to gain a better understanding of their biologic function.","['Martens-Uzunova, Elena S', 'Bottcher, Rene', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Jenster, Guido', 'Visakorpi, Tapio', 'Calin, George A']","['Martens-Uzunova ES', 'Bottcher R', 'Croce CM', 'Jenster G', 'Visakorpi T', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Urology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

Between January 2005 and January 2010, 84 cases of IFDs (39 proven and 45 probable) treated with combo were collected in 20 Hematological Italian Centres, in patients who underwent chemotherapy or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for haematological diseases. Median age of patients was 34 years (range 1-73) and 37% had less than 18 years. Acute leukaemia was the most common underlying haematological disease (68/84; 81%). The phase of treatment was as follows: first induction in 21/84 (25%), consolidation phase in 18/84 (21%) and reinduction/salvage in 45/84 (54%). The main site of infection was lung with or without other sites. The principal fungal pathogens were as follows: Aspergillus sp. 68 cases (81%), Candida sp. six cases (8%), Zygomycetes four cases (5%) and Fusarium sp. four cases (5%). The most used combo was caspofungin+voriconazole 35/84 (42%), caspofungin + liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) 20/84 (24%) and L-AmB+voriconazole 15/84 (18%). The median duration of combo was 19 days (range 3-180). The overall response rate (ORR) was 73% (61/84 responders) without significant differences between the combo regimens. The most important factor that significantly influenced the response was granulocyte (PMN) recovery (P 0.009). Only one patient discontinued therapy (voriconazole-related neurotoxicity) and 22% experienced mild and reversible adverse events (hypokalaemia, ALT/AST increase and creatinine increase). The IFDs-attributable mortality was 17%. This study indicates that combo was both well tolerated and effective in haematological patients. The most used combo regimens were caspofungin + voriconazole (ORR 80%) and caspofungin + L-AmB (ORR 70%). The ORR was 73% and the mortality IFD related was 17%. PMN recovery during combo predicts a favourable outcome.

The combination of pegylated interferon-alpha (Peg-IFN-alpha2b) and imatinib may increase the rate of successful discontinuation. METHODS: In this pilot study, we prospectively stopped imatinib from patients (n = 12) who had achieved major molecular response (MMR) after >/=12 months of treatment with either imatinib or imatinib+Peg-IFN-alpha2b. Molecular monitoring was carried out monthly for BCR-ABL1. In addition, analyses of lymphocyte immunophenotype, function, and plasma cytokines were performed. RESULTS: In the monotherapy group, 5/6 patients lost MMR within 4 months. One patient remains to date in MR(4.0) 61 months after discontinuation. In the combination therapy group, 2/6 patients relapsed within 4 months while still receiving Peg-IFN-alpha2b. Four of six patients were able to discontinue both treatments, but three of these patients relapsed after 3 months. One patient is still in sustained MR(4.0) at 58 months off all treatment. All relapsed patients re-responded to imatinib. The two successfully discontinued patients had either an increased number of NK-cells or functionally active T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: A higher frequency of relapsed patients in our study in comparison with other studies may be due to the shorter duration of imatinib treatment prior to discontinuation. However, in selected patients with an active immune system, even a short duration of TKI therapy (<2 yr) may allow for therapy discontinuation but this needs to be confirmed in larger prospective studies.","['Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Kreutzman, Anna', 'Rohon, Peter', 'Pihlman, Markus', 'Vakkila, Emmi', 'Rasanen, Anu', 'Vapaatalo, Mirja', 'Remes, Kari', 'Lundan, Tuija', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Vakkila, Jukka', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Porkka, Kimmo']","['Koskenvesa P', 'Kreutzman A', 'Rohon P', 'Pihlman M', 'Vakkila E', 'Rasanen A', 'Vapaatalo M', 'Remes K', 'Lundan T', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Vakkila J', 'Simonsson B', 'Mustjoki S', 'Porkka K']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140128,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'G8RGG88B68 (peginterferon alfa-2b)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12258 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2014;92(5):413-20. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12258.

The IgE antibodies from GM-allergic/CM-tolerant patients recognize caprine beta-casein (betacap) without cross-reacting with bovine beta-casein (betabov) despite a sequence identity of 91%. In this study, we investigated the non-cross-reactive IgE-binding epitopes of betacap. METHODS: Recombinant betacap was genetically modified by substituting caprine domains with the bovine counterparts and by performing site-directed mutagenesis. We then evaluated the recognition of modified betacap by IgE antibodies from 11 GM-allergic/CM-tolerant patients and 11 CM-allergic patients or by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) raised against caprine caseins. The allergenic potency of modified betacap was finally assessed by degranulation tests of humanized rat basophil leukaemia (RBL)-SX38 cells. RESULTS: Non-cross-reactive epitopes of betacap were found in domains 44-88 and 130-178. The substitutions A55T/T63P/L75P and P148H/S152P induced the greatest decrease in IgE reactivity of GM-allergic/CM-tolerant patients towards betacap. The pivotal role of threonine 63 was particularly revealed as its substitution also impaired the recognition of betacap by specific mAb, which could discriminate between betacap and betabov. The modified betacap containing the five substitutions was then unable to trigger the degranulation of RBL-SX38 cells passively sensitized with IgE antibodies from GM-allergic/CM-tolerant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although IgE-binding epitopes are spread all over betacap, a non-cross-linking version of betacap was generated with only five amino acid substitutions and could thus provide new insight for the design of hypoallergenic variants.","['Hazebrouck, S', 'Ah-Leung, S', 'Bidat, E', 'Paty, E', 'Drumare, M-F', 'Tilleul, S', 'Adel-Patient, K', 'Wal, J-M', 'Bernard, H']","['Hazebrouck S', 'Ah-Leung S', 'Bidat E', 'Paty E', 'Drumare MF', 'Tilleul S', 'Adel-Patient K', 'Wal JM', 'Bernard H']","[""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, CEA/iBiTeC-S/SPI, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Caseins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allergens/immunology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Caseins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Milk/*adverse effects', 'Milk Hypersensitivity/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Milk Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cea.12261 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2014 Apr;44(4):602-10. doi: 10.1111/cea.12261.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IgE', 'allergens and epitopes', 'casein', 'cross-reactivity', ""goat's milk""]",,,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,

We studied additional molecular and cytogenetic lesions and their prognostic impact in 305 MDS patients with del(20q) (229 males/76 females; 29-90 years). All patients were investigated by cytomorphology and chromosome banding analysis (CBA), subsets by fluorescence in situ hybridization, molecular mutation screening, and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). By aCGH (n = 30), the minimal common deleted region (CDR) was flanked by PTPRT (20q13.11) and EYA2 (20q13.12). 210 (68.9%) patients had 'early MDS' without blast increase, 95 (31.1%) 'advanced' MDS with blast increase (5-19%). Additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) were detected in 88/305 (28.9%) patients. Patients with advanced MDS more frequently had ACAs (P = 0.003) and had a higher mean number of ACAs (P = 0.020) and of molecular mutations (P = 0.060). Spliceosome mutations were frequent (U2AF1: n = 31/155; 20.0%; SRSF2: n = 31/159; 19.5%; SF3B1mut: n = 8/159; 5.0%). ASXL1mut (25/153; 16.3%) were associated with advanced MDS (P = 0.001). Presence of >/=3 ACAs (P = 0.003) and ASXL1mut (P = 0.002) were associated with worse 2-year survival. In conclusion, the cytogenetic subgroup of MDS with del(20q) has a good prognosis but may be further subclassified by additional cytogenetic and molecular lesions. U2AF1mut is overrepresented in MDS with del(20q), and ASXL1mut is prognostically adverse.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Zenger, Melanie', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Jeromin, Sabine', 'Roller, Andreas', 'Grossmann, Vera', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S', 'Zenger M', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Jeromin S', 'Roller A', 'Grossmann V', 'Krauth MT', 'Alpermann T', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131226,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/07/02 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12710 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Mar;164(6):822-33. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12710.

Bone marrow microenvironment supports haematopoiesis and comprises Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). Coinfusion of MSCs with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) improves engraftment and accelerates haematopoietic recovery. Stroma-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemotactic factor which plays a crucial role in stem cell transplantation by enhancing the ability of HSC to engraft. In this study expression of SDF-1 in bone marrow MSCs and the level of Colony Forming Unit Fibroblast (CFU-F) were evaluated in 8 patients with Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML). Evaluation was done at diagnosis and after induction/consolidation chemotherapy before the onset of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CFU-F frequency increases from diagnosis to remission. Nevertheless level of stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) transcripts in bone marrow MSCs of patients with AML stays low. Considering the role of SDF-1 in the homing of HSC, the consequences of SDF-1 deficiency observed in this study might be deleterious on the engraftment after HSCT and haematopoietic recovery. The whole result of this clinical study is an argument for MSC infusion to restore a normal level of SDF1 in the bone marrow microenvironment that could reduce hematopoietic toxicity of chemotherapy and improve HSC engraftment after HSCT.","['Fouillard, Loic', 'Francois, Sabine', 'Bouchet, Sandrine', 'Bensidhoum, Morad', ""Elm'selmi, Abdelatif"", 'Chapel, Alain']","['Fouillard L', 'Francois S', 'Bouchet S', 'Bensidhoum M', ""Elm'selmi A"", 'Chapel A']","['Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN), Laboratoire de Radiopathologie et de Therapie Experimentale, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay- aux-Roses, France. alain.chapel@irsn.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemoradiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['CPB-EPUB-58318 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201014666131227120222 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2013;14(9):842-8. doi: 10.2174/1389201014666131227120222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although increasing minimal residual disease (MRD) after HSCT had been proven to be highly indicative of posttransplant relapse, preemptive DLI (pDLI) based on MRD has not been well evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 70 acute leukemia patients after allo-HSCT in our center between January 2005 and December 2010. Sixteen patients received pDLIs based on increasing MRD results (pDLI group), and 11 relapsed patients received therapeutic DLIs with or without chemotherapy (tDLI group). Donor lymphocytes were collected from the original donors without stimulation and infused without further manipulation. The median mononuclear cell doses and CD3+ cell doses were 1.49 x 10(8) and 5.51 x 10(7) /kg. Forty-three patients who did not receive pDLI therapy after detecting increasing MRD (no pDLI group) were also included as a comparison. RESULTS: The response rate was 100% in the pDLI group, whereas it was 63.6% in the tDLI group (p=0.019). Survival outcomes were superior in the pDLI group compared with the tDLI group (chi(2) = 14.624, p=0.000); estimated overall survival (OS) at 1 year was 93.8% with pDLI and 27.3% with tDLI. The incidence of overall acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and Grade III to IV aGVHD was higher in the pDLI group but with no significance. Patients in the ""no pDLI"" group showed an inferior prognosis with 1-year OS at 65.1% (95% confidence interval, 50.8%-79.4%). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the efficacy and safety of pDLI and suggested that pDLI based on MRD monitoring was superior in acute leukemia patients with potential progression compared with salvage DLI administrated in overt relapse.","['Tan, Yamin', 'Du, Kaili', 'Luo, Yi', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Cao, Ling', 'Zheng, Yanlong', 'Zheng, Gaofeng', 'Zhao, Yanmin', 'Ye, Xiujing', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Huang, He']","['Tan Y', 'Du K', 'Luo Y', 'Shi J', 'Cao L', 'Zheng Y', 'Zheng G', 'Zhao Y', 'Ye X', 'Cai Z', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131223,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2014/01/01 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.12524 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2014 Jun;54(6):1493-500. doi: 10.1111/trf.12524.

Here, the generation of iPSCs from the Massachusetts General Hospital miniature pig (MGH minipig) established for organ transplantation studies is reported. Fibroblasts were isolated from the skin of the ear of a 10-day-old MGH minipig and transduced with a cocktail of six human factors: POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, C-MYC, KLF4, and LIN28. Two distinct types of iPSCs were generated that were positive for alkaline phosphatase activity, as well as the classical pluripotency markers: Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and the surface marker Ssea-1. Only one of two porcine iPSC lines differentiated into three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that the porcine iPSCs were dependent on LIF or BMP-4 to sustain self-renewal and pluripotency. In conclusion, the results showed that human pluripotent factors could reprogram porcine ear fibroblasts into the pluripotent state. These cells may provide a useful source of cells that could be used for the treatment of degenerative and genetic diseases and agricultural research and application.","['Kwon, Dae-Jin', 'Jeon, Hyelena', 'Oh, Keon Bong', 'Ock, Sun-A', 'Im, Gi-Sun', 'Lee, Sung-Soo', 'Im, Seok Ki', 'Lee, Jeong-Woong', 'Oh, Sung-Jong', 'Park, Jin-Ki', 'Hwang, Seongsoo']","['Kwon DJ', 'Jeon H', 'Oh KB', 'Ock SA', 'Im GS', 'Lee SS', 'Im SK', 'Lee JW', 'Oh SJ', 'Park JK', 'Hwang S']","['Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Center of Integrative Cellulomics, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-806, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Animal Biotechnology, Jeju National University, Jeju 690-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon, Gyeonggi 441-706, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Hospitals, General', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Massachusetts', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Swine', 'Swine, Miniature']",PMC3858863,2013/12/29 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/140639 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:140639. doi: 10.1155/2013/140639.

However, discharge practices vary once patients become afebrile, with many patients hospitalized until rise in the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to >500 (ANC recovery). Data to support this practice are sparse. We hypothesized that patients admitted for neutropenic fever, particularly if in complete remission (CR) or about to enter CR following the chemotherapy course associated with neutropenic fever, might be safely discharged earlier (ED). Benefits of ED are less exposure to hospital pathogens, reduced cost, increased availability of beds for patients more in need of urgent care, and potentially, enhanced psychological well-being. METHODS: We identified patients age 18-70 with newly diagnosed AML who were admitted to the University of Washington Medical Center with neutropenic fever between January 2008 and May 2010. We compared subsequent (within 30 days of discharge) deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and readmissions for neutropenic fever according to discharge ANC, regarded as a numerical variable using the Mann-Whitney U test and as <500 vs >500 using the Fisher Exact test. We used the Mann-Whitney U or Spearman correlation to analyze the relation between ANC at discharge and other covariates that might have affected outcome: age, ECOG performance status at admission for neutropenic fever, days inpatient, remission status, and type of infection (pneumonia, gram negative bacteremia, others). RESULTS: We evaluated 49 patients discharged after admission for neutropenic fever, 26 of whom were discharged with an ANC <500. Thirty five of the patients were in CR or entered CR following the chemotherapy course associated with their neutropenic fever admission. Patients who were discharged with lower ANC were more likely to be readmitted with neutropenic fever (Mann-Whitney U p=0.03), although this was not true using ANC categorized as < vs >500 (Fisher Exact p=0.24, 95% confidence interval -0.47, 0.11). There was no relation between ANC at discharge and subsequent admission to an ICU (Mann-Whitney U p=0.50, Fisher Exact p=0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.2, 0.34 using the 500 ANC cut off). One patient died: a 55 year old discharged with ANC 0 after successful treatment of neutropenic fever died 19 days after hospital readmission with fever of unknown origin. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia and sepsis were discovered 14 days after readmission. Assuming a beta distribution and rates of death of 1/26 for discharge with ANC<500 and 0/23 for discharge with ANC>500, the probability that a discharge ANC with <500 is associated with a higher death rate is 0.019. The number of events was too small for a multivariate analysis. However, patients with better performance status (<ECOG 2) or who spent a shorter time in hospital after admission for neutropenic fever were more likely to be discharged with lower ANC (Fisher exact p=0.09 and Spearman p=0.02 respectively), while the likelihood of discharge with ANC<500 was unrelated to age, remission status, or type of infection. Thus we examined the relation between ANC and readmission for neutropenic fever separately in patients with better or worse performance status and in patients who spent more or less than the median time (8 days) in hospital after admission for neutropenic fever. This analysis indicated that patients discharged with lower ANC were more likely to be readmitted only if they had spent more than 8 days in hospital or if they were performance status <2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an ANC of 500 is an excessively high cut off for discharge following hospitalization for neutropenic fever. The rate of rise of the ANC, as well as its absolute value, may also play a role.","['Chow, Victor', 'Dorcy, Kathleen Shannon', 'Sandhu, Ravinder', 'Gardner, Kelda', 'Becker, Pamela', 'Pagel, John', 'Hendrie, Paul', 'Abkowitz, Janis', 'Appelbaum, Frederick', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Chow V', 'Dorcy KS', 'Sandhu R', 'Gardner K', 'Becker P', 'Pagel J', 'Hendrie P', 'Abkowitz J', 'Appelbaum F', 'Estey E']","['University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA ; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, USA.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA ; Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Seattle, USA.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA ; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, USA.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA ; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, USA.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA ; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, USA.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, USA ; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130319,Netherlands,Leuk Res Rep,Leukemia research reports,101608906,,,,PMC3850377,2013/12/29 06:00,2013/12/29 06:01,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.lrr.2013.01.001 [doi]', 'S2213-0489(13)00002-2 [pii]']",epublish,Leuk Res Rep. 2013 Mar 19;2(1):26-8. doi: 10.1016/j.lrr.2013.01.001. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Discharge', 'Fever', 'Leukemia', 'Neutropenic', 'Neutrophil']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, to demonstrate whether biopsy from the flipper is useful for clinical diagnosis, we investigated the gene expression profiles and proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMC) isolated from the humeral bone marrow of bottlenose dolphins. BMMC exhibited gene expression profiles considered to be characteristic of hematopoietic cells. Similarly, a colony forming unit assay showed that dolphin BMMC possessed vigorous colony forming ability. The proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in the formation of three types of colonies, containing neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and eosinophils with or without megakaryocytes, all of which could be identified based on the morphological characteristics and gene expression profiles typically associated with hematopoietic markers.

NUP98, a nucleoporin, and its interaction partner Rae1, have been implicated in the control of chromosome segregation, but their mechanistic contributions to tumorigenesis have been unclear. Here, we show that expression of NUP98 fusion oncoproteins causes mitotic spindle defects and chromosome missegregation, correlating with the capability of NUP98 fusions to cause premature securin degradation and slippage from an unsatisfied spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). NUP98 fusions, unlike wild-type NUP98, were found to physically interact with the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)(Cdc20) and to displace the BubR1 SAC component, suggesting a possible mechanistic basis for their interference with SAC function. In addition, NUP98 oncoproteins displayed a prolonged half-life in cells. We found that NUP98 stability is controlled by a PEST sequence, absent in NUP98 oncoproteins, whose deletion reproduced the aberrant SAC-interfering activity of NUP98 oncoproteins. Together, our findings suggest that NUP98 oncoproteins predispose myeloid cells to oncogenic transformation or malignant progression by promoting whole chromosome instability.","['Salsi, Valentina', 'Ferrari, Silvia', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Fantini, Sebastian', 'Chiavolelli, Francesca', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Zappavigna, Vincenzo']","['Salsi V', 'Ferrari S', 'Gorello P', 'Fantini S', 'Chiavolelli F', 'Mecucci C', 'Zappavigna V']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena; and Department of Hematology, University of Perugia, University Hospital S.

However, the function of Gadd45a in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains unknown. Here, we reported that Gadd45a-deficient (Gadd45a(-/-)) mice showed a normal hematologic phenotype under homeostatic conditions. However, following 5-fluorouracil treatment, Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs exhibited a faster recovery, associated with an increase in the proliferation rate. Interestingly, young Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs showed enhanced reconstitution ability in serial transplantation. Following ionizing radiation (IR), young Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs exhibited an increased resistance to IR-induced DNA damage, associated with a decrease in the apoptosis rate and delayed DNA repair. The significantly higher level of DNA damage in Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs ultimately promoted B-cell leukemia in further transplanted recipient mice. In old mice, Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs were functionally equal to wild-type HSCs but exhibited more DNA damage accumulation and increased sensitivity to IR than wild-type HSCs.

It plays a pivotal role in cell fate determination. Dysregulated Notch signalling is oncogenic, inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival. Abnormal Notch signalling is seen in many cancers like T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and cancers of the breast, cervix, colon, pancreas, skin and brain. Inhibition of Notch signalling leads to growth arrest and differentiation in those cells in which Notch pathway is activated and this represents a new target for cancer therapy. Cancer develops from genome defects, including both genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetics deals with heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence. Among various epigenetic alterations such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and sumoylation, promoter region methylation is considered as an important component in cancer development. Epigenetic alterations can be used as biomarkers in screening, detection, diagnosis, staging and risk stratification of various cancers. DNA methylation can be therapeutically reversed and demethylating drugs have proven to be promising in cancer treatment. This review focusses on the methylation status of genes in Notch signalling pathway from various cancers and how this epigenetic alteration can be used as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.","['Aithal, Madhuri G S', 'Rajeswari, Narayanappa']","['Aithal MG', 'Rajeswari N']","['Department of Biotechnology, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore 560 078, India. nraja7@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,India,J Genet,Journal of genetics,2985113R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",,2013/12/29 06:00,2014/06/28 06:00,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12041-013-0284-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Genet. 2013 Dec;92(3):667-75. doi: 10.1007/s12041-013-0284-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This knowledge has driven the discovery of important regulators that silence gamma-globin postnatally. Improved understanding of the gamma- to beta-globin switching mechanism holds the key to devising targeted therapies for beta-hemoglobinopathies. To further investigate this mechanism, we used the murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cell line containing an intact 183-kb human beta-globin locus, in which the (G)gamma- and beta-globin genes are replaced by DsRed and eGFP fluorescent reporters, respectively. Following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of two key transcriptional regulators, Myb and BCL11A, we observed a derepression of gamma-globin, measured by DsRed fluorescence and qRT-PCR (P<0.001). Interestingly, double knockdown of Myb and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) resulted in a robust induction of epsilon-globin, (up to 20% of total beta-like globin species) compared to single knockdowns (P<0.001). Conversely, double knockdowns of BCL11A and DNMT1 enhanced gamma-globin expression (up to 90% of total beta-like globin species) compared to single knockdowns (P<0.001). Moreover, following RNAi treatment, expression of human beta-like globin genes mirrored the expression levels of their endogenous murine counterparts. These results demonstrate that Myb and BCL11A cooperate with DNMT1 to achieve developmental repression of embryonic and fetal beta-like globin genes in the adult erythroid environment.","['Roosjen, Mark', 'McColl, Bradley', 'Kao, Betty', 'Gearing, Linden J', 'Blewitt, Marnie E', 'Vadolas, Jim']","['Roosjen M', 'McColl B', 'Kao B', 'Gearing LJ', 'Blewitt ME', 'Vadolas J']","[""1Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Rd., Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia. jim.vadolas@mcri.edu.au.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131226,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Bcl11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '0 (epsilon-Globins)', '0 (fluorescent protein 583)', '0 (gamma-Globins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'epsilon-Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'gamma-Globins/genetics/metabolism']",,2013/12/29 06:00,2014/06/03 06:00,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.13-242669 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.13-242669 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2014 Apr;28(4):1610-20. doi: 10.1096/fj.13-242669.

Slow-transforming retroviruses have been widely used to perform genetic screens for the identification of genes involved in cancer. To investigate the involvement of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) integration in myeloid leukosis (ML) in chickens, we utilized an ALV-J insertional identification platform based on hybrid capture target enrichment and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Using high-definition mapping of the viral integration sites in the chicken genome, 241 unique insertion sites were obtained from six different ALV-J-induced ML samples. On the basis of previous statistical definitions, MYC, TERT, and ZIC1 genes were identified as common insertion sites (CIS) of provirus integration in tumor cells; these three genes have previously been shown to be involved in the malignant transformation of different human cell types. Compared to control samples, the expression levels of all three CIS genes were significantly upregulated in chicken ML samples. Furthermore, they were frequently, but not in all field ML cases, deregulated at the mRNA level as a result of ALV-J infection. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between multipathotypes associated with ALV-J infection and the molecular background of tumorigenesis. IMPORTANCE: ALV-Js have been successfully eradicated from chicken breeding flocks in the poultry industries of developed countries, and the control and eradication of ALV-J in China are now progressing steadily. To further study the pathogenesis of ALV-J infections, it will be necessary to elucidate the in vivo viral integration and tumorigenesis mechanism. In this study, 241 unique insertion sites were obtained from six different ALV-J-induced ML samples. In addition, MYC, TERT, and ZIC1 genes were identified as the CIS of ALV-J in tumor cells, which might be a putative ""driver"" for the activation of the oncogene. In addition, the CIS genes showed deregulated expression compared to nontumor samples. These results have potentially important implications for the mechanism of viral carcinogenesis.","['Li, Yuhao', 'Liu, Xuemei', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Xu, Chenggang', 'Liu, Di', 'Qin, Jianru', 'Dai, Manman', 'Hao, Jianyong', 'Feng, Min', 'Huang, Xiaorong', 'Tan, Liqiang', 'Cao, Weisheng', 'Liao, Ming']","['Li Y', 'Liu X', 'Yang Z', 'Xu C', 'Liu D', 'Qin J', 'Dai M', 'Hao J', 'Feng M', 'Huang X', 'Tan L', 'Cao W', 'Liao M']","[""National and Regional Joint Engineering Laboratory for Medicament of Zoonoses Prevention and Control, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131226,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Avian Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Chickens', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poultry Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', '*Virus Integration']",PMC3957963,2013/12/29 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02995-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02995-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Mar;88(6):3182-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02995-13.

In fish species, the use of this compound is of special interest in intra and interspecies germ cell transplants. To determine the effects of busulfan in fish a previous range finding experiment was designed. Survival and growth rate of 150-days after hatching (150DAH) Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles was determined. In a second experiment, the effects of a sublethal busulfan dose in fish germ cell depletion and in somatic tissues were analysed. Sublethal effects of several busulfan treatments (B10-10 days after injection, B20-20 days after injection, B20/-20 days after injection with double injection) were determined in somatic and gonadal tissues. Alterations were registered through histopathological techniques, TUNEL (cell apoptosis) and quantified at molecular level (Q-PCR analyses) using the vasa mRNAs (Ssvasa1-2 and Ssvasa3-4 mRNAs) as molecular markers for germinal cells in Senegalese sole juveniles. Several sublethal effects were observed with 40 mg kg(-)(1) busulfan, a non-lethal dose, such as: pyknosis in liver, increase of melanomacrophage centres and blood stagnation in spleen and interruption of gonadal development. Females were more affected by busulfan treatments than males in terms of germ cell disruption, since a significant decrease in the expression of both Ssvasa1-2 and Ssvasa3-4 markers was found in the gonad of treated females rather than males. At 10 days post-treatment (B10), females already presented a decrease in germ cell proliferation, as confirmed by Q-PCR. Ssvasa expression proved to be a reliable tool for the direct evaluation of the effects of busulfan on Senegalese sole gonadal development, proving that busulfan can be a suitable treatment for causing transient sterility in recipient gonads for germ cell transplantation.","['Pacchiarini, T', 'Olague, E', 'Sarasquete, C', 'Cabrita, E']","['Pacchiarini T', 'Olague E', 'Sarasquete C', 'Cabrita E']","['ICMAN-Institute of Marine Science of Andalusia, Spanish National Research Council, Puerto Real, Cadiz, Spain.', 'ICMAN-Institute of Marine Science of Andalusia, Spanish National Research Council, Puerto Real, Cadiz, Spain.', 'ICMAN-Institute of Marine Science of Andalusia, Spanish National Research Council, Puerto Real, Cadiz, Spain.', 'ICMAN-Institute of Marine Science of Andalusia, Spanish National Research Council, Puerto Real, Cadiz, Spain. elsa.cabrita@icman.csic.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131227,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Breeding/methods', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flatfishes/genetics/*growth & development', 'Gametogenesis/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genetic Markers/drug effects', 'Germ Cells/drug effects/metabolism/transplantation', 'Gonads/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/veterinary', 'Sterilization, Reproductive/methods/veterinary']",,2013/12/29 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['HH-11-412 [pii]', '10.14670/HH-29.10.619 [doi]']",ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2014 May;29(5):619-28. doi: 10.14670/HH-29.10.619.

It acts by inhibiting several enzymes in the folate pathway, thereby resulting in the disruption of folate homeostasis. To date, treatment regimens have not been personalized despite there being experimental evidence that gene polymorphisms of folate metabolizing enzymes affect MTX response. The aim of this review was to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms of the enzymes involved in the MTX pathway on ALL treatment outcomes and identify factors underlining the failure to personalize MTX therapy. METHODS: We conducted a literature search in PUBMED and Google Scholar using the following key words: methotrexate, polymorphism, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. RESULTS: The reasons for the failure to personalize MTX therapy may be due to (1) most studies involving single-center, small-sized cohorts, (2) differences in MTX dose across different protocols, (3) failure to consider minimal residual disease as a risk factor for post-induction treatment, (4) differences in outcome criteria between studies and (5) failure to consider the folate levels of a patient before initiation of MTX therapy. Although high-throughput techniques allow the mapping of thousands of genetic polymorphisms in a single run, it remains a major challenge to dissect out folate-metabolizing enzymes which have a high impact on the efficacy and toxicity of MTX and which, therefore, could be the targets for intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective pharmacogenetic studies which consider all of the above-mentioned factors should be undertaken to facilitate the design of personalized MTX treatment for ALL patients.","['Kodidela, Sunitha', 'Suresh Chandra, Pradhan', 'Dubashi, Biswajit']","['Kodidela S', 'Suresh Chandra P', 'Dubashi B']","['Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India, kodidela.sunitha@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131227,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics']",,2013/12/29 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2013/12/28 06:00'],"['2013/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-013-1623-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2014 Mar;70(3):253-60. doi: 10.1007/s00228-013-1623-4.

METHODS: A literature review on bacteraemias in cancer patients considered papers published between January 1st 2005 and July 6th 2011. Additionally, in 2011, a questionnaire on the aetiology and resistance in bacteraemias, and empirical treatment, was sent to participants of the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) meetings; recipients were from 80 haematology centres. RESULTS: For the literature review, data from 49 manuscripts were analysed. The questionnaire obtained responses from 39 centres in 18 countries. Compared with the published data, the questionnaire reported more recent data, and showed a reduction of the Gram-positive to Gram-negative ratio (55%:45% vs. 60%:40%), increased rates of enterococci (8% vs. 5%) and Enterobacteriaceae (30% vs. 24%), a decreased rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5% vs. 10%), and lower resistance rates for all bacteria. Nevertheless the median rates of ESBL-producers (15-24%), aminoglycoside-resistant Gram-negatives (5-14%) and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (5-14%) were substantial, and significantly higher in South-East vs. North-West Europe. CONCLUSIONS: The published epidemiological data on bacteraemias in haematology are scanty and mostly dated. Important differences in aetiology and resistance exist among centres. Updated analyses of the local epidemiology are mandatory to support appropriate empirical therapy.","['Mikulska, Malgorzata', 'Viscoli, Claudio', 'Orasch, Christina', 'Livermore, David M', 'Averbuch, Diana', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Akova, Murat']","['Mikulska M', 'Viscoli C', 'Orasch C', 'Livermore DM', 'Averbuch D', 'Cordonnier C', 'Akova M']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, San Martino Hospital, University of Genoa, Largo R.

Recently, it has been found that CD47 interacts with SIRPalpha expressed on phagocytic cells, which transfers a negative signal when being activated. By the mechanisms described above, CD47-SIRPalpha signal complex is involved in the pathogenesis of hematological diseases and might provide some informations for the therapy of patients. This review focuses on the structure and immunoregulatory functions of CD47, the mechanism of CD47 in tumor therapy, the CD47 and hematologic malignancies including acute leukemia, B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma, as well as CD47 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Su, Guo-Hong', 'Zhao, Yu-Lei']","['Su GH', 'Zhao YL']","['The Second Department of Hematology, Cangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou 061000, Hebei Province, China.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation, These cells were cultured with three cytokines for 7 days to induce their maturation. On the 5th day, cells were loaded with leukemia cell HL-60 lysates. NOD2 expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The phenotype of DC were analyzed by flow cytometry, and ELISA was used to assay levels of IL-12 (p40) . The results showed that MDP could trigger NOD2 mRNA and protein expression in different groups of DC, especially in sensitized DC+MDP group, which was significantly higher than that in the DC+MDP group and sensitized DC without MDP stimulation, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Besides, the expression of surface molecules (HLA-DR, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40) in the group of DC loaded with leukemia cell lysate and stimulated by MDP (sensitized DC+MDP) reached the highest level, followed by the group of DC loaded with leukemia cell lysate without MDP and DC only stimulated by MDP, non-treated DC were the lowest (P < 0.05). Similarly, compared with untreated unstimulated DC, after loading with HL-60 lysates or only stimulating with MDP, the secretion of IL-12p40 increased, but IL-12p40 level (573.86 +/- 32.09 pg/ml) in DC+MDP group was higher than that in group of sensitized DC (365.03 +/- 28.86 pg/ml) (P < 0.05), and it in sensitized DC+MDP group reached the highest (898.30 +/- 61.08) pg/ml, compared to other groups (P < 0.05). It is concluded that MDP can significantly enhance the NOD2 mRNA and protein expression in sensitized DC, promote the expression of HLA-DR, synergistic costimulatory molecules and adhesion molecules of DC, at the same time, MDP can increase secretion of inflammatory factors IL-12p40.

The expression levels of 11 patients with MLL-AF9 fusion gene positive were detected precisely by RQ-PCR during the treatment in order to analyze the correlation of detection results with clinical manifestations. The results showed that the expression levels of MLL-AF9 fusion gene in patients at initial diagnosis were 1.3%-55.28%. RESULTS: obtained from 5 patients who received chemotherapy alone during the interval between first and second courses of chemotherapy indicated that 2 patients with <0.1% of MLL-AF9 fusion gene expression levels all achieved hematologic complete remission and survived, while the remaining 3 patients with >/= 0.1% of MLL-AF9 fusion gene did not achieve hematologic complete remission and only 1 case survived. Moreover, results obtained from 6 transplant patients within a month before the transplantation suggested that 4 of them with < 0.1% of MLL-AF9 fusion gene expression levels survived without relapses, while the remaining 2 patients with >/= 0.1% of MLL-AF9 fusion gene expression levels relapsed and died. Besides, MLL-AF9 fusion gene expression levels were >/= 0.1% within one month before the morphological relapse of bone marrow in 2 recurrent patients. It is concluded that the detecting the expression level of MLL-AF9 fusion gene by RQ-PCR is an effective and accurate method to quantify and monitor the MRD level of MLL-AF9 gene positive AML patients and may be used for early detecting molecular relapse of AML.","['Huang, Sai', 'Yang, Hua', 'Gao, Li', 'Dou, Li-Ping', 'Xu, Yuan-Yuan', 'Wang, Nan', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Yu, Li']","['Huang S', 'Yang H', 'Gao L', 'Dou LP', 'Xu YY', 'Wang N', 'Wang LL', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Freindship Hospital, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.

The expressions of NKG2D ligand MICA/B, ULBP1-3 in several human leukemia cell lines (K562, OUN-1, U937 and K562/AO2), as well as primary leukemic cells isolated from malignant leukemia patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. After treatment with different doses of matrine, the expression level of NKG2D ligands in these leukemic cells was detected by FCM. The results indicated that NKG2D ligand expression was detected in both the leukemia cell lines and primary malignant leukemic cells. Generally, the expression of ULBP was high or obviously higher than that of MICA/B in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells. The expression pattern of NKG2D ligands was different among these cells, possibly due to the different types of leukemia. Not all the expression of NKG2D ligands was upregulated after matrine treatment. Much higher expressions of ULBP2 and ULBP3 were found in K562 cells, compared to the other cell lines, which partly contributes to the higher sensitivity of K562 cells to NK cytotoxicity as target cells. It is concluded that there is universal expression of NKG2D ligand in leukemia cells. The high ULBP expression is prevalent in human leukemia cells. Matrine has the potential to induce the expression of NKG2D ligands in leukemia cells.","['Ma, Ling-Di', 'Lu, Xu-Zhang', 'Zhu, Zhi-Chao', 'Jiang, Li-Jia', 'Zhou, Min', 'Qian, Si-Xuan', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Ma LD', 'Lu XZ', 'Zhu ZC', 'Jiang LJ', 'Zhou M', 'Qian SX', 'Li JY']","[""Lab Center, Changzhou No.2 People's Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou 213000, Jiangsu Province, China.

The apoptotic levels of U937-WT, U937-Mock and U937-A/E1-4 cells were examined by flow cytometry. And cleaved caspase-3 protein expression was detected by Western blot. BCL-2 gene expression both in AML1-ETO-expressing cells or U937 nonexpressing cells and in leukemia cells of AML patients with or without t(8;21) was assessed by quantitative PCR. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based PCR was used to investigate the direct interaction between the AML1-ETO and BCL-2 promoter in AML1-ETO positive leukemia cell line. The results indicated that in U937-A/E cells but not in U937-WT or U937-Mock cells, apoptotic cells statistically significantly increased, and AML1-ETO expression also significantly enhanced activation of caspase-3. AML1-ETO-expressing cell subclones displayed significantly low levels of BCL-2 mRNA in comparison with the non-transfected U937. In primary bone marrow cells of acute myeloid leukemia containing AML1-ETO, levels of BCL-2 mRNA were markedly lower as compared with other acute myeloid leukemias lacking this translocation. The enriched regions in transfected cells were located within BCL-2 promoter. It is concluded that BCL-2 is the direct target gene of AML1-ETO.

Immunophenotyping and NPM1 gene mutation type-A,B and D and other leukemic related fusion genes were detected by multiparameter flow cytometry and real time RT-PCR or PCR, respectively. 77 AML patients with a normal karyotype (NK) and mutated NPM1 gene (NPM1m(+)AML) detected by immunophenotyping assay were included in this study. 55 cases without NPM1 mutation (NPM1m(-)AML) and with normal karyotype were served as negative control. The results showed that there was significant difference between NPM1m(+)AML and NPM1m(-)AML in terms of sex, white blood count, platelet counts, blast, WT1 expression level, FLT3-ITD mutation positive rate and response to treatment. The characteristic immunophenotype is lower expression of early differentiation-associated antigens (CD34, HLA-DR, CD117, CD38), lymphocytic antigens (CD7, CD4, CD19, CD2) and higher expression of CD33 and CD123 (P < 0.05).

After transfection, the cells were cultured in IMDM containing 10% FCS without growth factors, or with one of the following growth factor combinations: (1) murine c-kit ligand (KL) plus human flt3 ligand (FL); (2) IL-3, thrombopoietin, G-CSF, and hyper-IL-6 (3/T/G/H6); (3) KL/FL plus 3/T/G/H6. The flow cytometry was used to detect the ability of combinations of growth factors to complement the oncogene fusion protein to support self-renewal of the transfected cells. The results showed that the transfected cells could be amplified sustainably in the logarithmic growth way. The indicated combination of c-Kit ligand (KL) with flt-3 ligand (FL) supported the self-renewal of the marrow cells transfected with vectors encoding TEL-PDGFR, Rabaptin5-PDGFR, AML1-ETO and NPM-ALK, in addition to KL/FL, the self-renewal of p210 BCR-ABL transfected-marrow cells also required IL-3. The morphology of cells emerged from culture can be the predictor of the corresponding oncogene-associated malignancy. It is concluded that this study establishes a culture system ex vivo which provides a generalized method for studying hematological malignancies, and may facilitate the screening for therapeutic agents.","['Zhao, Sheng-Ming', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang', 'Liu, Hui', 'Peng, Ming-Ting']","['Zhao SM', 'Wang JX', 'Liu H', 'Peng MT']","['Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences(CAMS), Beijing 100730, China; Department of Hematology,Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China.

Furthermore, how it contributes to leukemogenesis is unknown. Here, we describe a molecular network that is important for TrkA function in leukemogenesis. We found that TrkA is frequently overexpressed in other types of leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including AML. In addition, TrkA was overexpressed in patients with MDS or secondary AML evolving from MDS. TrkA induced significant hematological malignancies by inducing PLK-1 and Twist-1, and enhanced survival and proliferation of leukemia, which was correlated with activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, endogenous TrkA associated with c-Src complexes was detected in leukemia. Suppression of c-Src activation by TrkA resulted in markedly decreased expression of PLK-1 and Twist-1 via suppressed activation of Akt/mTOR cascades. These data suggest that TrkA plays a key role in leukemogenesis and reveal an unexpected physiological role for TrkA in the pathogenesis of leukemia. These data have important implications for understanding various hematological malignancies.","['Kim, Min Soo', 'Kim, Gyoung Mi', 'Choi, Yun-Jeong', 'Kim, Hye Joung', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Jin, Wook']","['Kim MS', 'Kim GM', 'Choi YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YJ', 'Jin W']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 406-840, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 406-840, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 406-840, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Republic of Korea.

P-TEFb activation classically occurs by a feedback-regulated process of signal-induced, reversible release of active Cdk9-cyclin T modules from large, inactive 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) complexes. Here, we have identified an alternative pathway of irreversible P-TEFb activation in megakaryopoiesis that is mediated by dissolution of the 7SK snRNP complex. In this pathway, calpain 2 cleavage of the core 7SK snRNP component MePCE promoted P-TEFb release and consequent upregulation of a cohort of cytoskeleton remodeling factors, including alpha-actinin-1. In a subset of human megakaryocytic leukemias, the transcription factor GATA1 undergoes truncating mutation (GATA1s). Here, we linked the GATA1s mutation to defects in megakaryocytic upregulation of calpain 2 and of P-TEFb-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling factors. Restoring calpain 2 expression in GATA1s mutant megakaryocytes rescued normal development, implicating this morphogenetic pathway as a target in human leukemogenesis.","['Elagib, Kamaleldin E', 'Rubinstein, Jeremy D', 'Delehanty, Lorrie L', 'Ngoh, Valerie S', 'Greer, Peter A', 'Li, Shuran', 'Lee, Jae K', 'Li, Zhe', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Mihaylov, Ivailo S', 'Goldfarb, Adam N']","['Elagib KE', 'Rubinstein JD', 'Delehanty LL', 'Ngoh VS', 'Greer PA', 'Li S', 'Lee JK', 'Li Z', 'Orkin SH', 'Mihaylov IS', 'Goldfarb AN']","['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada."", 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.

METHODS: Endocytoscopy and magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging (NBI) were performed in 17 patients with lymphomas of the stomach. The lesions consisted of 7 with low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), 5 with gastric involvement by adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 4 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 1 with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. RESULTS: On conventional endoscopy, 9 were classified as having superficial spreading type, 7 were mass-forming type, and 1 was diffuse infiltrating type. Anti-H. pylori treatment was given in the 7 MALT lymphoma cases. NBI magnification endoscopy invariably showed dilatation or ballooning and destruction of gastric pits and elongation and distortion in microvessels. Endocytoscopy showed mucosal aggregation of interstitial cellular elements in almost all gastric lymphoma cases. The nuclear diversity in size and configuration was exclusively seen in gastric lymphomas other than MALT lymphoma, whereas the nuclei of MALT lymphoma cells were regular and small to moderate in size. Inter-glandular infiltration by lymphomatous cell elements was frequently observed in MALT lymphoma and DLBCL, but it was uncommon in peripheral gastric T-cell malignancies. Endocytoscopy could identify the disease-specific histology, the lymphoepithelial origin, as inter-glandular infiltration of cellular components in MALT lymphoma and the possibly related DLBCL cases. Complete regression (CR) was observed in 2 of the 7 MALT lymphoma patients. In the 2 patients with CR who underwent repeat endocytoscopy, the ultra-high magnification abnormalities returned to normal, while they were unchanged in those without tumor regression. CONCLUSIONS: On endocytoscopy, intra-glandular aggregation of cellular components was invariably identified in lymphomas of the stomach. Nuclear regularity in size and configuration may indicate the cytological grade, differentiating the indolent low-grade from aggressive lymphoproliferative diseases.

We hypothesized that next-generation exomic sequencing would identify recurrent mutations that may have prognostic or therapeutic implications. Ten patients were selected on the basis of availability of tissue and adequate follow-up. They were treated at our institution between September 2002 and August 2004. Using next-generation exomic sequencing, we tested for mutations in 236 cancer-related genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slides. MCL1 amplification was additionally tested with immunohistochemical staining. Detectable mutations were found in 8 patients (80%). Seven patients harbored a KRAS mutation, most commonly involving codon 12. Four GNAS mutations (R201H/R201C substitutions) were also detected. MCL1 and JUN were concurrently amplified in three patients. One patient with MCL1 and JUN amplification had concurrent amplification of MYC and NFKBIA. ZNF703 was amplified in one patient. Patients with MCL1 amplification were also found to express MCL1 with immunohistochemistry, but MCL1 expression was also detected in some patients without amplification. To our knowledge, we are the first to report MCL1 and JUN coamplification in PMP. Expression of MCL1 may not be completely dependent on amplification. The prognostic and therapeutic implications of these recurrent mutational events are the subject of ongoing investigation.","['Sio, Terence T', 'Mansfield, Aaron S', 'Grotz, Travis E', 'Graham, Rondell P', 'Molina, Julian R', 'Que, Florencia G', 'Miller, Robert C']","['Sio TT', 'Mansfield AS', 'Grotz TE', 'Graham RP', 'Molina JR', 'Que FG', 'Miller RC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterologic and General Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '1] Division of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA [2] Division of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterologic and General Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131226,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (Chromogranins)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GNAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromogranins', 'Demography', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs/genetics', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Pseudomyxoma Peritonei/*genetics/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",PMC3973125,2013/12/27 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2013/12/27 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jhg2013132 [pii]', '10.1038/jhg.2013.132 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2014 Mar;59(3):124-8. doi: 10.1038/jhg.2013.132.

The disease was acute myeloblastic leukemia (50 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and others. Conditioning was myeloablative (80 patients) or reduced intensity. The stem cell source was bone marrow (75 patients), peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood. After AHSCT, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given to all patients. All patients showed engraftment of the donor cells. FCM was conducted on a median of 22 days after AHSCT. The gate was set around a granulocytic region consisting of immature granulocytes.

Although imatinib mesylate was started thereafter, the adherence to this treatment was poor because of his occupational circumstances. In September 2009, imatinib mesylate was switched to nilotinib, with a subsequent phase of acceleration of the disease, presumably due to his poor adherence to the treatment.

This study was undertaken to know the prevalence of ZAP-70 and CD 38 in the treatment naive patients of CLL seen at a tertiary care centre of north India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ZAP-70 and CD 38 were tested by flow cytometry on peripheral blood samples. ZAP-70 positive and CD 38 positivity was defined as positive expression on 20% and 30% of CLL cells, respectively. Clinico-hematological profile and its correlation with ZAP-70 and CD 38 were assessed in consecutive 80 CLL patients. RESULTS: There were 64 males and median age of the group was 58 years. Sixteen patients (20%) were asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally. Median total lymphocyte count (TLC) at presentation was 62 x 10 9 /L. Rai stage distribution was: Stage 0-6, stage I-20, stage II-36, stage III-5, and stage IV-13. ZAP-70 and CD 38 positivity were detected in 20 patients (25%) and 29 patients (36%), respectively. Eleven patients were positive and 34 were negative for both ZAP-70 and CD 38 yielding a concordance rate of 56%. There was no statistically significant difference between ZAP-70 and CD 38 positivity and negativity with regard to age, sex, Lymphocyte count, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and Rai staging. CONCLUSION: ZAP-70 and CD 38 positivity were detected 25% and 36%, respectively, with concordance rate of 56%, which is higher than Western literature. There was no correlation of ZAP-70 and CD 38 positivity with age, sex, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and Rai staging.","['Gogia, A', 'Sharma, A', 'Raina, V', 'Kumar, L', 'Gupta, R', 'Kumar, R']","['Gogia A', 'Sharma A', 'Raina V', 'Kumar L', 'Gupta R', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.

METHODS: 104 adult ALL patients from Blood Diseases Hospital & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between August 2008 and November 2011 were enrolled. COX proportional hazards regression stratified by Dummy variable was used to set up the prediction model; Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test were used to estimate and compare the survival. After calculated individual PI value, patients' expected survival should be estimated by groups. RESULTS: The overall median survival of adult ALL patients was 22.00 months (95% CI 17.00-27.00). COX regression analysis showed that chemotherapy group patients had a higher risk of recurrence than of ASCT group while setting treatment as the dummy variable (RR=2.052, 95%CI 0.877-4.799, P=0.007). Stratified Analysis showed that the risk factors of B-ALL recurrence in adult patients included HGB <100 g/L (RR=0.186, 95% CI 0.068-0.512, P=0.001), CNSL (RR=7.767,95% CI 2.951- 20.433, P=0.001), number of consolidation chemotherapy<3 (RR=0.445, 95% CI 0.211-0.940, P=0.034) and Ph chromosome positive (RR=2.771, 95% CI 1.353-5.674, P=0.005). Grouped by the PI value, the expected survival of each individual patient could be estimated as PI=0.58 base. CONCLUSION: HGB, CNSL, number of consolidation chemotherapy and Ph chromosome were independent risk factors of B-ALL recurrence in adult patients. PI value could predict the survival of adult ALL patients and provide reference for individual therapy and prognostic evaluation.","['Chen, Pei-cui', 'Wang, Ting-yu', 'Zou, De-hui', 'Qiu, Lu-gui', 'Zhang, Cui-xian', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Liu, Gui-fen', 'Luo, Tian-e']","['Chen PC', 'Wang TY', 'Zou DH', 'Qiu LG', 'Zhang CX', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu GF', 'Luo TE']","['Department of Eepidemiology and Health Statistics, Shanxi Medical University,Taiyuan 030001,China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/27 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2013/12/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.12.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Dec;34(12):1050-4. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.12.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From November 1998 to October 2010, 70 consecutive newly diagnosed childhood LBL (5 B-LBL and 65 T-LBL) were enrolled in this study, in which 22 received CCCG-97 and 48 CCCG-2002 protocols. St.Jude staging system was adopted. Patients were divided into three risk groups based on clinical stage and serum LDH, and received chemotherapy with different intensity. The factors, which were possibly associated with the prognosis, were analyzed. The survival rates were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The patients were 1.5 to 14 years old with the median age of 8 years old. They were evaluated as stage I-II for 6 , stage III41, and stage IV23 (15 were BM positive and 8 multiple bone metastases). Until Dec.31th, 2011,the mean follow-up was 62.5 months (range, 14 to 161 months) with the median follow-up of 48 months. 1-year overall survival (OS) was 74.3%, and 5- year event-free survival (EFS) 64.1% (abundance as event). Thirteen patients were complicated with serious condition during chemotherapy and 1 died of complication.

METHODS: The bioinformatics software and database were applied to predict and analyze target genes of miR-125b. The vector contained the target gene 3'-UTR portion cloned into a luciferase reporter construct. A luciferase reporter assay was performed following co-transfection of small molecular miR-125b mimics and target gene wild-type or mutant plasmid into HEK-293T cells. Further in leukemia cell lines NB4 and HL-60, the protein level of target gene was measured by Western blot after overexpression miR-125b. Finally, the viabilities of NB4 and HL-60 cells were measured by CCK-8 assay at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h after electroporation. RESULTS: Bcl-2-antagonist/killer 1 (Bak1), a pro-apoptotic gene, was a target gene of miR-125b by software predicts. Reporter vector containing the 3'-UTR Bak1 wild and mutation sites were co-transfected with small molecule analogues of miR-125b in HEK-293T cells. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay system showed that miR-125b significantly suppresses the reporter gene activity containing Bak1 3'-UTR by about 53.8% (P<0.05), but it didn't suppresses the reporter gene activity containing 3'-UTR Bak1 mutation. Western blot showed that miR-125b mimics significantly down-regulated the expression of Bak1 in human leukemia cell lines NB4 and HL-60. Meanwhile, the growth rate of cells treated with miR-125b obviously increased compared with that in control by CCK-8 test (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly indicated that BAK1 was a downstream target gene of miR-125b, and miR-125b promoted proliferation in human AML cells at least partially by targeting Bak1, so we speculated that miR-125b as an oncogene could be a potential therapeutic target for treating AML.","['Zeng, Qiao-hui', 'Xu, Ling', 'Liu, Xiao-dan', 'Liao, Wang', 'Yan, Mu-xia']","['Zeng QH', 'Xu L', 'Liu XD', 'Liao W', 'Yan MX']","['The Department of Scientific Education Information, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou 510623, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/12/27 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2013/12/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.12.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Dec;34(12):1010-4. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.12.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the expression level of NANOG gene and protein in MOLT-4, CCRF-HSB2 and Jurkat cells. To test the efficiency of RNA interference, MOLT-4 cells were firstly infected by lentiviral vectors, which were successfully constructed with NANOG specific shRNA. NANOG expression levels were subsequently re-evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blot. The percentages of early apoptotic cells (Annexin V(+)/7-AAD(-)) and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V(+)/7-AAD(+)) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis-related genes was also detected. RESULTS: Both NANOG gene and protein expression was positive in MOLT-4 and CCRF-HSB2 cells. The lentiviral vectors pLB-shNANOG-1, pLB-shNANOG-2, and pLB-sh control were successfully constructed, as evidenced by the viral titers (1.83-3.12)x 10(8) IU/ml. The experimental data on infection of MOLT-4 cells with such lentiviral vectors revealed that both shRNA interfering sequences (shNANOG-1 and shNANOG-2) could stably down-regulate NANOG gene and protein expressions. The percentages of early apoptotic cells in groups of shNANOG-1[(8.06 +/- 1.61)%]and shNANOG-2[(5.67 +/- 1.59)%]were significantly increased as compared to that of MOLT-4 group[(1.13 +/- 0.40)%]or sh-control [(1.15+/-0.49)%](P<0.05). However, no statistical difference among them was observed for late apoptotic cells (P>0.05).

The public became aware of male-mediated developmental toxicity in the early 1990s when it was reported that men working at Sellafield might be causing leukemia in their children. Human and animal studies have contributed to our current understanding of male-mediated effects. Animal studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that genetic damage after radiation and chemical exposure might be transmitted to offspring. With the increasing understanding that there is histone retention and modification, protamine incorporation into the chromatin and DNA methylation in mature sperm and that spermatozoal RNA transcripts can play important roles in the epigenetic state of sperm, heritable studies began to be viewed differently. Recent reports using molecular approaches have demonstrated that DNA damage can be transmitted to babies from smoking fathers, and expanded simple tandem repeats minisatellite mutations were found in the germline of fathers who were exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. In epidemiological studies, it is possible to clarify whether damage is transmitted to the sons after exposure of the fathers. Paternally transmitted damage to the offspring is now recognized as a complex issue with genetic as well as epigenetic components.","['Anderson, Diana', 'Schmid, Thomas E', 'Baumgartner, Adolf']","['Anderson D', 'Schmid TE', 'Baumgartner A']","['Division of Medical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford West Yorkshire, BD, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Asian J Androl,Asian journal of andrology,100942132,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenomics', 'Fathers', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Minisatellite Repeats/drug effects', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Paternal Exposure', 'Rats', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Spermatozoa/*drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects']",PMC3901885,2013/12/27 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/12/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['AsianJAndrol_2014_16_1_81_122342 [pii]', '10.4103/1008-682X.122342 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian J Androl. 2014 Jan-Feb;16(1):81-8. doi: 10.4103/1008-682X.122342.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may also represent blastic transformation of myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms. Although usually seen in the context of advanced and poorly controlled disease, it may also present as the first manifestation of illness, without concurrent bone marrow or blood involvement. In the medical literature, chloroma and GS are terms that have been used interchangeably with myeloid sarcoma. GS usually manifests as soft tissue or bony masses in several extracranial sites, such as bone, periosteum, and lymph nodes; involvement of the head and neck region is uncommon. We report a case of a woman with insidious onset of progressive nasal congestion and diminished hearing who was diagnosed with an isolated GS of the nasopharynx. With involved field radiotherapy, she achieved a complete remission of 12-months duration before being diagnosed with overt AML. She has remained disease-free for greater than 18 months following induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Through a MEDLINE(R)/PubMed(R) search we identified an additional 13 cases of nasopharyngeal GS. The median age was 37 years (range 1 to 81 years). The cases were equally distributed among the sexes. The most common presenting symptoms were conductive hearing loss and sinonasal congestion. Isolated GS was identified in six cases, and the median time from diagnosis of GS to AML was 12 months (range 3 to 48 months). The treatment varied, but responses were seen in all the patients who received chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.","['Vishnu, Prakash', 'Chuda, Ravindra Reddy', 'Hwang, Dick G', 'Aboulafia, David M']","['Vishnu P', 'Chuda RR', 'Hwang DG', 'Aboulafia DM']","['Floyd and Delores Jones Cancer Institute at Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Floyd and Delores Jones Cancer Institute at Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA ; Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20131217,New Zealand,Int Med Case Rep J,International medical case reports journal,101566269,,,,PMC3869915,2013/12/26 06:00,2013/12/26 06:01,['2013/12/26 06:00'],"['2013/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IMCRJ.S53612 [doi]', 'imcrj-7-001 [pii]']",epublish,Int Med Case Rep J. 2013 Dec 17;7:1-6. doi: 10.2147/IMCRJ.S53612. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chloroma', 'myeloid sarcoma', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH APPROACH: A qualitative design based on a series of open-ended interviews and one focus group. SETTING: Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 50 participants recruited from the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland database that represented a sample of major diagnostic groups, age, gender, and geographic location of patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Interviews and focus groups were open-ended and were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and thematically analyzed to form the basis of the findings. FINDINGS: The majority of participants in the study saw a perceived benefit in regular telephone follow-up as a supportive care service. Benefits included the positive aspects of individualized attention, potential support created for those not open to conventional types of support, and the positive effects of allowing support organizations to keep track of patient progress. However, some participants did not want to receive regular telephone follow-up support because of a desire to move on and access to other support through friends, family, or healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the current study affirm previous research. Attitudes toward a telephone follow-up support service vary from patient to patient. Research demonstrates that patients with cancer responded with attitudes that range from favorable to unfavorable toward the benefits and usefulness of telephone support. INTERPRETATION: Oncology nurses provide supportive care for patients with hematologic malignancies, and they serve as a key professional group to provide follow-up telephone supportive care. Based on the findings from the current article, oncology nurses who provide supportive care should be aware of differing attitudes among patients with hematologic malignancies toward telephone follow-up support. Nurses participating in support initiatives should recognize the notion of patient receptivity and how it affects telephone support strategies.","['McGrath, Pam']",['McGrath P'],"['Centre for Community Science, Griffith Health Institute, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aftercare/methods/*psychology', 'Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/nursing/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/nursing/psychology', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Oncology Nursing/*methods/organization & administration', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Patients/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', '*Social Support', 'Survivors/*psychology', '*Telephone', 'Treatment Refusal/psychology']",,2013/12/26 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/12/26 06:00'],"['2013/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['G113366154W25052 [pii]', '10.1188/14.ONF.40-44 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2014 Jan 1;41(1):40-4. doi: 10.1188/14.ONF.40-44.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hematologic malignancy', 'psychosocial', 'qualitative research', 'supportive care', 'telephone follow-up']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate resistance mechanisms, we generated two azacitidine-resistant cell lines, THP-1/AR and HL60/AR, and studied genetic disparities between them and their corresponding parental lines. In cells treated with azacitidine, significant mitotic variations were noted in parental cells which were absent in resistant cells, suggesting that resistance arises from negating azacitidine-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and reestablishing G2/M checkpoint. Importantly, both resistant cell lines have common point mutations in the uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the azacitidine activation pathway. Forced expression of mutated UCK2 in parental THP-1 cells abrogated azacitidine-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild type UCK2 in resistant THP-1/AR cells restored sensitivity to azacitidine, implying that UCK2 gene mutations perturb azacitidine activation and advance azacitidine resistance. Our study provides new insights into azacitidine resistance and establishes models useful in developing effective strategies to overcome it.","['Sripayap, Piyanuch', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Uesawa, Mitsuyo', 'Kobayashi, Hiroyuki', 'Tsukahara, Tomonori', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Muroi, Kazuo', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Sripayap P', 'Nagai T', 'Uesawa M', 'Kobayashi H', 'Tsukahara T', 'Ohmine K', 'Muroi K', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.

Therefore, other TKIs with a more selective effect against this chimeric kinase should be used for the treatment of patients with SNX2-ABL1+ ALL.","['Tomita, Osamu', 'Iijima, Kazutoshi', 'Ishibashi, Takeshi', 'Osumi, Tomoo', 'Kobayashi, Kenichiro', 'Okita, Hajime', 'Saito, Masahiro', 'Mori, Tetsuya', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka']","['Tomita O', 'Iijima K', 'Ishibashi T', 'Osumi T', 'Kobayashi K', 'Okita H', 'Saito M', 'Mori T', 'Shimizu T', 'Kiyokawa N']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

In addition to EBV, host genetic factors are believed to be important determinants of NPC risk. Of all genes studies to date, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have shown the most consistent evidence for association with NPC, both from candidate-gene studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this report we summarize results from recent studies that evaluated the association between HLA and NPC, and discuss whether findings reflect direct causal associations for HLA genes and/or indirect associations that mark causal associations with other genes in the gene-dense major histocompatibility (MHC) region where HLA resides. We also compare GWAS results across cancer sites for which strong hits in the MHC region were observed to generate new hypotheses regarding the role of HLA genes in the development of EBV-associated cancers such as NPC. Of note, we report that MHC associations for EBV-associated cancers (NPC, EBV+ Hodgkin lymphoma) are driven by HLA class I genes. In contrast, MHC associations for other viral-associated cancers (cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma) or other hematopoetic cancers (EBV- Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphomas) are driven by HLA class II genes, and those for other solid tumors with less clear links to infections (lung, testicular, prostate cancers) are driven by non-HLA genes in the MHC region. Future studies should aim to better understand these patterns.","['Su, Wen-Hui', 'Hildesheim, Allan', 'Chang, Yu-Sun']","['Su WH', 'Hildesheim A', 'Chang YS']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University , Taoyuan , Taiwan ; Chang Gung Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University , Taoyuan , Taiwan.', 'Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute , Bethesda, MD , USA.', 'Chang Gung Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University , Taoyuan , Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131209,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC3856645,2013/12/25 06:00,2013/12/25 06:01,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00299 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Dec 9;3:299. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00299.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV', 'HLA antigens', 'genome-wide association study', 'infection associated cancers', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Workup revealed a white blood cell count of 685 x 10(3)/muL with marked increase in granulocyte series and myeloid precursors on peripheral smear. The initial impression was chronic myelogenous leukemia with hyperleukocytosis, and patient was started on hydration, hydroxyurea, and allopurinol. Patient tolerated bone marrow biopsy well but continued to bleed excessively from the biopsy site. Results confirmed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (chronic phase). On day three of hospitalization, patient developed sudden slurred speech along with shaking movements involving extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple hemorrhages throughout the brain. Hydroxyurea was continued until insurance coverage for nilotinib was getting approved. On day nine of hospitalization, patient developed sudden bilateral sensorineural deafness. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple new hemorrhages throughout the brain. Computer tomography of the temporal bones showed inflammatory changes in right and left mastoid cells. Nilotinib was started on day eleven of hospitalization. Patient's white blood cell count continued to decrease, but there was no improvement in hearing. Four months later, patient was treated with bilateral transmastoid cochlear implants.

The absence of consistent environmental risk factors and the presence of modest familial associations suggest ALL is a complex trait with an underlying genetic component. The identification of genetic factors associated with disease is complicated by complex genetic covariance structures and multiple testing issues. Both issues can be resolved with appropriate Bayesian variable selection methods. The present study was undertaken to extend our hierarchical Bayesian model for case-parent triads to incorporate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and incorporate the biological grouping of SNPs within genes. Based on previous evidence that genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway influences ALL risk, we evaluated 128 tagging SNPs in 16 folate metabolic genes among 118 ALL case-parent triads recruited from the Texas Children's Cancer Center (Houston, TX) between 2003 and 2010. We used stochastic search gene suggestion (SSGS) in hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the association between folate metabolic SNPs and ALL. Using Bayes factors among these variants in childhood ALL case-parent triads, two SNPs were identified with a Bayes factor greater than 1. There was evidence that the minor alleles of NOS3 rs3918186 (OR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15) and SLC19A1 rs1051266 (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.46) were positively associated with childhood ALL. Our findings are suggestive of the role of inherited genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway on childhood ALL risk, and they also suggest the utility of Bayesian variable selection methods in the context of case-parent triads for evaluating the role of SNPs on disease risk.","['Cao, Ying', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Swartz, Michael D', 'Nousome, Darryl', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Cao Y', 'Lupo PJ', 'Swartz MD', 'Nousome D', 'Scheurer ME']","['Division of Biostatistics, The University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Biostatistics, The University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, The University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)']",IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Genetic Association Studies/*methods', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/*genetics', 'Texas']",PMC3868670,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084658 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-22929 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 19;8(12):e84658. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084658. eCollection 2013.,,,,"['K07 CA131505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K07CA131505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When C6-ceramide is encapsulated in a nanoliposome bilayer formulation, cell death is selectively induced in tumor models. However, the mechanism underlying this selectivity is unknown. As most tumors exhibit a preferential switch to glycolysis, as described in the ""Warburg effect"", we hypothesize that ceramide nanoliposomes selectively target this glycolytic pathway in cancer. We utilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a cancer model, which has an increased dependency on glycolysis. In CLL cells, we demonstrate that C6-ceramide nanoliposomes, but not control nanoliposomes, induce caspase 3/7-independent necrotic cell death. Nanoliposomal ceramide inhibits both the RNA and protein expression of GAPDH, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, which is overexpressed in CLL. To confirm that ceramide targets GAPDH, we demonstrate that downregulation of GAPDH potentiates the decrease in ATP after ceramide treatment and exogenous pyruvate treatment as well as GAPDH overexpression partially rescues ceramide-induced necrosis. Finally, an in vivo murine model of CLL shows that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide treatment elicits tumor regression, concomitant with GAPDH downregulation. We conclude that selective inhibition of the glycolytic pathway in CLL cells with nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could potentially be an effective therapy for leukemia by targeting the Warburg effect.","['Ryland, Lindsay K', 'Doshi, Ushma A', 'Shanmugavelandy, Sriram S', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Aliaga, Cesar', 'Broeg, Kathleen', 'Baab, Kendall Thomas', 'Young, Megan', 'Khan, Osman', 'Haakenson, Jeremy K', 'Jarbadan, Nancy Ruth', 'Liao, Jason', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Liu, Xin', 'Kester, Mark']","['Ryland LK', 'Doshi UA', 'Shanmugavelandy SS', 'Fox TE', 'Aliaga C', 'Broeg K', 'Baab KT', 'Young M', 'Khan O', 'Haakenson JK', 'Jarbadan NR', 'Liao J', 'Wang HG', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Liu X', 'Kester M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States of America ;
