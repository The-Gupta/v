The role of REV3L in chemosensitivity of cervical cancer needs exploration. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of the Polzeta protein in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and found that the expression of Polzeta in cervical cancer tissues was higher than that in normal tissues. We then established some cervical cancer cell lines with REV3L suppression or overexpression. Depletion of REV3L suppresses cell proliferation and colony formation of cervical cancer cells through G1 arrest, and REV3L promotes cell proliferation and colony formation of cervical cancer cells by promoting G1 phase to S phase transition. The suppression of REV3L expression enhanced the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin, and the overexpression of REV3L conferred resistance to cisplatin as evidenced by the alteration of apoptosis rates, and significantly expression level changes of anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl) and proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated x protein (Bax). Our data suggest that REV3L plays an important role in regulating cervical cancer cellular response to cisplatin, and thus targeting REV3L may be a promising way to alter chemosensitivity in cervical cancer patients.","['Yang, Li', 'Shi, Tingyan', 'Liu, Fei', 'Ren, Chunxia', 'Wang, Ziliang', 'Li, Yingyi', 'Tu, Xiaoyu', 'Yang, Gong', 'Cheng, Xi']","['Yang L', 'Shi T', 'Liu F', 'Ren C', 'Wang Z', 'Li Y', 'Tu X', 'Yang G', 'Cheng X']","['Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China."", 'Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150317,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (REV3L protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4364373,2015/03/18 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120334 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-33433 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 17;10(3):e0120334. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120334. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past several years, we have witnessed major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of ALL. Genome-wide profiling studies, including microarray analysis and genome sequencing, have helped identify multiple key cellular pathways that are frequently mutated in ALL such as lymphoid development, tumour suppression, cytokine receptors, kinase and Ras signalling, and chromatin remodeling. These studies have characterized new subtypes of ALL, notably Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL, which is a high-risk subtype characterized by a diverse range of alterations that activate cytokine receptors or tyrosine kinases amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Genomic profiling has also enabled the identification of inherited genetic variants of ALL that influence the risk of leukaemia development, and characterization of the relationship between genetic variants, clonal heterogeneity and the risk of relapse. Many of these findings are of direct clinical relevance and ongoing studies implementing clinical sequencing in leukaemia diagnosis and management have great potential to improve the outcome of patients with high-risk ALL.","['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Roberts KG', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Mail Stop 342, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Mail Stop 342, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150317,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

In this study, a microelectromechanical systems-based, isolated 3D-electrode DEP device has been designed and implemented for the label-free detection of multidrug resistance in K562 leukemia cells, based on the differences in their cytoplasmic conductivities. Cells were hydrodynamically focused to the 3D-electrode arrays, placed on the side walls of the microchannel, through V-shaped parylene-C obstacles. 3D-electrodes extruded along the z-direction provide uniformly distributed DEP force through channel depth. Cell suspension containing resistant and sensitive cancer cells with 1:100 ratio was continuously flown through the channel at a rate of 10 muL/min. Detection was realized at 48.64 MHz, the cross-over frequency of sensitive K562 cells, at which sensitive cells flow with the fluid, while the resistant ones are trapped by positive DEP force. Device can be operated at considerably low voltages (<9 Vpp ). This is achieved by means of a very thin (0.5 mum) parylene coating on electrodes, providing the advantages offered by the isolation of electrodes from the sample, while the working voltage can still be kept low. Results prove that the presented DEP device can provide an efficient platform for the detection of multidrug resistance in leukemia, in a label-free manner.","['Demircan, Yagmur', 'Koyuncuoglu, Aziz', 'Erdem, Murat', 'Ozgur, Ebru', 'Gunduz, Ufuk', 'Kulah, Haluk']","['Demircan Y', 'Koyuncuoglu A', 'Erdem M', 'Ozgur E', 'Gunduz U', 'Kulah H']","['Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, METU, Ankara, Turkey.', 'METU-MEMS Research and Applications Center, Ankara, Turkey.', 'METU-MEMS Research and Applications Center, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, METU, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biology, METU, Ankara, Turkey.', 'METU-MEMS Research and Applications Center, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biology, METU, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, METU, Ankara, Turkey.', 'METU-MEMS Research and Applications Center, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150420,Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,,IM,"['Cell Separation/*instrumentation/methods', 'Computer Simulation', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophoresis/*instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Limit of Detection']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2016/01/28 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/elps.201400391 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2015 May;36(9-10):1149-57. doi: 10.1002/elps.201400391.

Nuclear factor one (NFI) transcription factors are important in regulating hematopoiesis and here we report an important physiological role of NFIX in B- and myeloid lineage commitment and differentiation. We demonstrate that NFIX acts as a regulator of lineage specification in the haematopoietic system and the expression of Nfix was transcriptionally downregulated as B cells commit and differentiate, whilst maintained in myeloid progenitor cells. Ectopic Nfix expression in vivo blocked early B cell development stage, coincident with the stage of its downregulation. Furthermore, loss of Nfix resulted in the perturbation of myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation, and a skewing of gene expression involved in lineage fate determination. Nfix was able to promote myeloid differentiation of total bone marrow cells under B cell specific culture conditions but not when expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSPC), consistent with its role in HSPC survival. The lineage choice determined by Nfix correlated with transcriptional changes in a number of genes, such as E2A, C/EBP, and Id genes. These data highlight a novel and critical role for NFIX transcription factor in hematopoiesis and in lineage specification.","[""O'Connor, Caitriona"", 'Campos, Joana', 'Osinski, Jason M', 'Gronostajski, Richard M', 'Michie, Alison M', 'Keeshan, Karen']","[""O'Connor C"", 'Campos J', 'Osinski JM', 'Gronostajski RM', 'Michie AM', 'Keeshan K']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland."", 'Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics Program and Department of Biochemistry, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.', 'Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics Program and Department of Biochemistry, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150317,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfix protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Myelopoiesis', 'NFI Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4363787,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120102 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-43200 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 17;10(3):e0120102. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120102. eCollection 2015.,,,,"['G0601099/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K014854/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

C-kit gene is a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase class III (RTK) that is expressed by early hematopoietic progenitor cells and plays an important role in hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. It is known that c-kit is a proto-oncogene and the activating c-kit mutations are likely to contribute in the development of leukaemia in humans. Exon 11 of c-Kit gene is the frequent site for mutations in different kinds of tumours. METHODS: In order to determine the frequency and prevalence of exon 11 mutations in 51 AML cases, we have done polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The c-kit mutations in exon 11 were detected in 15.68% (8/51) in AML cases. We have detected totally ten missense mutations in eight AML cases those include Lys550Asn, Tyr568Ser, Ile571Leu, Tyr578Pro, Trp582Ser and Arg588Met and novel missense mutations at codons Ile563Lys and Val569Leu. Mutations at codons Ile571Leu and Trp582Ser was found in two independent cases. CONCLUSION: The presence of c-kit mutations in our study adds to investigative spectrum of AML cases. Since the c-kit mutations are seen in other malignancies, mutations in exon 11 of the c-kit gene might be involve in pathogenesis and represent useful predictive genetic marker in AML. Further studies in larger group of cases possibly will be required to determine the prognostic implications and to investigate how these mutations are co-related to the progression and pathogenesis of AML.","['Hussain, S R', 'Raza, S T', 'Babu, S G', 'Singh, P', 'Naqvi, H', 'Mahdi, F']","['Hussain SR', 'Raza ST', 'Babu SG', 'Singh P', 'Naqvi H', 'Mahdi F']","[""Dept. of Biochemistry, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Lucknow, India."", ""Dept. of Biochemistry, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Lucknow, India."", 'Dept. of Biotechnology, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, India.', 'Dept. of Pathology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', ""Dept. of Biochemistry, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Lucknow, India."", ""Dept. of Biochemistry, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Lucknow, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,,PMC4352523,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2012 Winter;5(1):27-32.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukaemia', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene proteins c-kit', 'Single-Stranded Conformational Polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 22-year-old man presented with fever, chills, and a painful throat. Leukoplakia was noted on his tongue and some of his fingers and toe nails were markedly dystrophic. His skin seemed spotted with pigmentation on the anterior chest and neck. Patient reported family history of ""blood disease"" and leukemia. He was admitted for the management of neutropenic fever (102.9 degrees F, WBC: 940, ANC: 404, platelets: 21,000 and Hb: 9.2), and was put on broad spectrum antibiotics. A bone marrow biopsy revealed normocellular marrow with erythroid predominance and mild dyserythropoiesis. Chromosomal analysis indicated no numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities. The fluorescence in situ hybridization report did not reveal any assay specific abnormalities. Viral marker for hepatitis and studies of autoimmune antibodies showed negative results. CT scan had shown splenomegaly. Patient was discharged after he has been fever and symptoms free, with a follow-up at hematology clinic. Individuals with DC most commonly present with skin pigmentation, dystrophic nails and leukoplakia, as presented in this case. Genetic abnormality was not confirmed in our patient, but it is suggested that X-linked recessive pattern would be significant because of greater prevalence in men than in women (10:1). The distribution of blood counts and bone marrow biopsy categorizes our patient in the moderate aplastic anemia class which is the most prevalent pattern. When fever in young patients with a failing bone marrow is diagnosed, it is important that physicians rule out the possible underlying causes. DC is a rare disease, but can be diagnosed by simple inspection of the mucocutaneous abnormalities. DC is a severe multisystem disorder associated with premature morbidity and mortality. We believe that reporting this case would add more information to the existing fund of knowledge.","['Shiferaw, Bethel', 'Mukka, Satish', 'Ha, Lawrence', 'Bekele, Ebisa', 'Ramos De Oleo, Radhames']","['Shiferaw B', 'Mukka S', 'Ha L', 'Bekele E', 'Ramos De Oleo R']","['Department of Medicine, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20150301,Canada,J Clin Med Res,Journal of clinical medicine research,101538301,,,,PMC4356098,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/03/18 06:01,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14740/jocmr2056w [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Med Res. 2015 May;7(5):361-3. doi: 10.14740/jocmr2056w.

Residual tumor cells are the main origin of tumor relapse. The aim of this study was to eliminate the residual tumor cells of hematopoietic tumors. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are used in immunotherapy to deplete the residual cells. However, it is necessary to increase the antitumor activity and clinical applicability of CIK cells. The present study investigated the antitumor activity of CIK cells to the SU-DHL2 human B-cell lymphoma and K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines. CD3(+)CD56(+) cells from healthy donors were expanded in culture with cytokines and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb; rituximab) to generate CIK cells. A preliminary investigation of their mechanism was then performed. The increase in the cytotoxicity of the CIK cells induced by the anti-CD20 mAb was associated with an increase in the expression of cytotoxic factors. The expression of components of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathways was found to increase. Upregulation of the expression of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 is important as these co-stimulatory molecules enhance T-cell proliferation. Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway is a possible mechanism for the anti-apoptosis effect on the proliferation of CIK cells. In conclusion, anti-CD20 mAb may play an important role in the improvement of CIK-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cells. These observations may aid in the improvement of the effects of immunotherapy in depleting the residual cells of hematopoietic tumors. Thus, the use of CIK cells cultured with anti-CD20 mAb could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the depletion of chemotherapy-resistant or residual cells in anaplastic large and B-cell lymphoma.","['Deng, Q I', 'Bai, Xue', 'Lv, Hai-Rong', 'Xiao, Xia', 'Zhao, Ming-Feng', 'Li, Yu-Ming']","['Deng QI', 'Bai X', 'Lv HR', 'Xiao X', 'Zhao MF', 'Li YM']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin 300192, P.R.

Feature extraction for gene selection, mainly serves two purposes. One is to identify certain disease-related genes. The other is to find a compact set of discriminative genes to build a pattern classifier with reduced complexity and improved generalization capabilities. Depending on the purpose of gene selection, two types of feature extraction algorithms including ranking-based feature extraction and set-based feature extraction are employed in microarray gene expression data analysis. In ranking-based feature extraction, features are evaluated on an individual basis, without considering inter-relationship between features in general, while set-based feature extraction evaluates features based on their role in a feature set by taking into account dependency between features. Just as learning methods, feature extraction has a problem in its generalization ability, which is robustness. However, the issue of robustness is often overlooked in feature extraction. In order to improve the accuracy and robustness of feature extraction for microarray data, a novel approach based on multi-algorithm fusion is proposed. By fusing different types of feature extraction algorithms to select the feature from the samples set, the proposed approach is able to improve feature extraction performance. The new approach is tested against gene expression dataset including Colon cancer data, CNS data, DLBCL data, and Leukemia data. The testing results show that the performance of this algorithm is better than existing solutions.","['Jiang, Zhu', 'Xu, Rong']","['Jiang Z', 'Xu R']","['State Key Laboratory of Astronautic Dynamics, Xian Satellite Control Center, Xian, China ; Key Laboratory of Fluid and Power Machinery, Ministry of Education, Xihua University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Astronautic Dynamics, Xian Satellite Control Center, Xian, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150130,Singapore,Bioinformation,Bioinformation,101258255,,,,PMC4349936,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/03/18 06:01,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.6026/97320630011027 [doi]', '97320630011027 [pii]']",epublish,Bioinformation. 2015 Jan 30;11(1):27-33. doi: 10.6026/97320630011027. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['feature extraction', 'microarray data', 'multi-algorithm fusion', 'robustness']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we designed a comprehensive study of BCL6 expression in B-lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: BCL6, LMO, and HGAL protein expression in B-lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated using immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded bone marrow specimens. Cryptic TCF3(E2A)-PBX1 rearrangements were investigated using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Six (12%) of 52 B-lymphoblastic leukemias demonstrated BCL6 protein expression, with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemias containing a t(1;19) translocation demonstrating the strongest staining (three of three). Additional t(1;19) cases beyond the screening study showed similar results. Public microarray expression database mining showed that BCL6 messenger RNA expression levels in B-lymphoblastic leukemia correlated with the protein expression findings. Finally, other markers of B-cell development correlated with BCL6 expression in t(1;19) B-lymphoblastic leukemia cases, with LMO2 and HGAL proteins expressed in six (67%) of nine and eight (89%) of nine cases, respectively.

METHODS: NMSC and peritumoral epidermis protein expression of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry in renal transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus or sirolimus and the general population not receiving immunosuppression. RESULTS: NMSC from renal transplant recipients compared with patients not receiving immunosuppressant medications had a reduced Bcl-xL expression intensity (P = .042). Mcl-1 expression intensity in NMSC was decreased in tacrolimus-treated patients compared with sirolimus-treated patients and the nonimmunosuppressed population (P = .024). Bcl-xL expression intensity was increased in peritumoral epidermis compared with NMSC (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: It was shown for the first time that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression are widespread in the peritumoral epidermis and NMSC of renal transplant recipients. Importantly in NMSC, Bcl-xL expression was reduced with immunosuppression exposure, and Mcl-1 expression was reduced in tacrolimus-treated compared with sirolimus-treated patients.","['Burke, Michael T', 'Morais, Christudas', 'Oliver, Kimberley A', 'Lambie, Duncan L J', 'Gobe, Glenda C', 'Carroll, Robert P', 'Staatz, Christine E', 'Sinnya, Sudipta', 'Soyer, H Peter', 'Winterford, Clay', 'Haass, Nikolas K', 'Campbell, Scott B', 'Isbel, Nicole M']","['Burke MT', 'Morais C', 'Oliver KA', 'Lambie DL', 'Gobe GC', 'Carroll RP', 'Staatz CE', 'Sinnya S', 'Soyer HP', 'Winterford C', 'Haass NK', 'Campbell SB', 'Isbel NM']","['From the Departments of Renal Medicine and Michael.burke@health.qld.gov.au.', 'Centre for Kidney Disease Research, School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia;', 'Pathology, University of Queensland at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia;', 'IQ Pathology, Brisbane, Australia; The University of Queensland, The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia;', 'Centre for Kidney Disease Research, School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia;', 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Services, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Medicine, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia;', 'School of Pharmacy, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia;', 'Dermatology Research Centre, The University of Queensland, School of Medicine, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia; and.', 'Dermatology Research Centre, The University of Queensland, School of Medicine, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia; and.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland, The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia;', 'From the Departments of Renal Medicine and.', 'From the Departments of Renal Medicine and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/therapeutic use', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use', 'Transplant Recipients', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/06/04 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['143/4/514 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPQNB5WA3PLQBK [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Apr;143(4):514-26. doi: 10.1309/AJCPQNB5WA3PLQBK.,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-xL', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mcl-1', 'Mitosis', 'Nonmelanoma skin cancer', 'Renal transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its potential role in management of hematopoietic malignancies has not yet been determined. Here, we evaluated the IL11R as a candidate therapeutic target in human leukemia and lymphoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: First, we show that the IL11R protein is expressed in a variety of human leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines and in a large panel of bone marrow samples from leukemia and lymphoma patients, whereas expression is absent from nonmalignant control bone marrow. Moreover, a targeted peptidomimetic prototype (termed BMTP-11), specifically bound to leukemia and lymphoma cell membranes, induced ligand-receptor internalization mediated by the IL11R, and resulted in a specific dose-dependent cell death induction in these cells. Finally, a pilot drug lead-optimization program yielded a new myristoylated BMTP-11 analogue with an apparent improved antileukemia cell profile. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate (i) that the IL11R is a suitable cell surface target for ligand-directed applications in human leukemia and lymphoma and (ii) that BMTP-11 and its derivatives have translational potential against this group of malignant diseases.","['Karjalainen, Katja', 'Jaalouk, Diana E', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Bover, Laura', 'Sun, Yan', 'Kuniyasu, Akihiko', 'Driessen, Wouter H P', 'Cardo-Vila, Marina', 'Rietz, Cecilia', 'Zurita, Amado J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Calin, George A', 'Koivunen, Erkki', 'Arap, Wadih', 'Pasqualini, Renata']","['Karjalainen K', 'Jaalouk DE', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Bover L', 'Sun Y', 'Kuniyasu A', 'Driessen WH', 'Cardo-Vila M', 'Rietz C', 'Zurita AJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes JE', 'Calin GA', 'Koivunen E', 'Arap W', 'Pasqualini R']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

However, how SLFN11 is regulated in cancer cells remained unknown. Ewing sarcoma, which is characterized by the chimeric transcription factor EWS-FLI1, has notably high SLFN11 expression, leading us to investigate whether EWS-FLI1 drives SLFN11 expression and the role of SLFN11 in the drug response of Ewing sarcoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Binding sites of EWS-FLI1 on the SLFN11 promoter were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and promoter-luciferase reporter analyses. The relationship between SLFN11 and EWS-FLI1 were further examined in EWS-FLI1-knockdown or -overexpressing cells and in clinical tumor samples. RESULTS: EWS-FLI1 binds near the transcription start site of SLFN11 promoter and acts as a positive regulator of SLFN11 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells. EWS-FLI1-mediated SLFN11 expression is responsible for high sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma to camptothecin and combinations of PARP inhibitors with temozolomide. Importantly, Ewing sarcoma patients with higher SLFN11 expression showed better tumor-free survival rate. The correlated expression between SLFN11 and FLI1 extends to leukemia, pediatric, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. In addition, expression of other ETS members correlates with SLFN11 in NCI-60 and CCLE datasets, and molecular experiments demonstrate that ETS1 acts as a positive regulator for SLFN11 expression in breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply the emerging relevance of SLFN11 as an ETS transcription factor response gene and for therapeutic response to topoisomerase I inhibitors and temozolomide-PARP inhibitor combinations in ETS-activated cancers.","['Tang, Sai-Wen', 'Bilke, Sven', 'Cao, Liang', 'Murai, Junko', 'Sousa, Fabricio G', 'Yamade, Mihoko', 'Rajapakse, Vinodh', 'Varma, Sudhir', 'Helman, Lee J', 'Khan, Javed', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Tang SW', 'Bilke S', 'Cao L', 'Murai J', 'Sousa FG', 'Yamade M', 'Rajapakse V', 'Varma S', 'Helman LJ', 'Khan J', 'Meltzer PS', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Developmental Therapeutics Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Developmental Therapeutics Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Developmental Therapeutics Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.

Recent evidences establish anticancer effect of mesenchymal stem cells. However multiple factors including type of cancer, MSC source, study design, and animal model play role in final outcome. Wharton's jelly - a newly approved source of MSCs - possesses superiorities to bone marrow as the conventional source; therefore investigation of its medical effects can produce beneficial results. In this survey we examined cytotoxic and proapoptotic effect of human Wharton's jelly MSC secretome on K562 human leukemia cells. MSCs were isolated from human Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord by explant culture method, then characterized according to ISCT criteria (morphology and plastic adherence, surface antigenicity and differentiation potential). MSC secretome was collected and its cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects on K562 cells in combination with doxorubicin were evaluated using BrdU cell proliferation assay and Annexin V-PI staining. Our results showed antiproliferative effect of mesenchymal stem cell secretome on K562 cancer cells, the effect was also added to cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin without induction of drug resistance. Human Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells exerted cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells. Addition of that effect to anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic agents can leads to cytotoxic drug dose reduction and diminished side effects.","['Hendijani, Fatemeh', 'Javanmard, Shaghayegh Haghjooy', 'Sadeghi-aliabadi, Hojjat']","['Hendijani F', 'Javanmard SH', 'Sadeghi-aliabadi H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

However, the clinical impact of ITPR2 in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) remained unknown. Several microarray datasets were used to evaluate the association between ITPR2 expression and clinical and molecular characteristics. ITPR2 showed a higher expression in CN-AML patients than normal persons. In a cohort of 157 CN-AML patients, high ITPR2 expression (ITPR2high) was associated with dramatically shorter overall survival (OS; P = 0.004) and event-free survival (EFS; P = 0.01), which were also shown in the European Leukemia Net (ELN) intermediate-I genetic category (OS: P = 0.0066; EFS: P = 0.009). Multivariable analyses adjusting for known prognostic factors confirmed ITPR2high to be associated with shorter OS (P = 0.0019) and EFS (P = 0.012). The prognostic value of ITPR2 was further validated in another cohort of 162 CN-AML patients (P = 0.007). In addition, first gene/microRNA expression signatures were derived that associated with ITPR2high on the genome-wide scale, which provided many indications to illustrate the possible mechanisms why ITPR2 could function.

Kaempferol, one of the flavonoids, is widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and may have cancer chemopreventive properties. However, the precise underlying mechanism regarding induced DNA damage and suppressed DNA repair system are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether kaempferol induced DNA damage and affected DNA repair associated protein expression in human leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro. Percentages of viable cells were measured via a flow cytometry assay. DNA damage was examined by Comet assay and DAPI staining. DNA fragmentation (ladder) was examined by DNA gel electrophoresis. The changes of protein levels associated with DNA repair were examined by Western blotting. Results showed that kaempferol dose-dependently decreased the viable cells. Comet assay indicated that kaempferol induced DNA damage (Comet tail) in a dose-dependent manner and DAPI staining also showed increased doses of kaempferol which led to increased DNA condensation, these effects are all of dose-dependent manners. Western blotting indicated that kaempferol-decreased protein expression associated with DNA repair system, such as phosphate-ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (p-ATM), phosphate-ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (p-ATR), 14-3-3 proteins sigma (14-3-3sigma), DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (DNA-PK), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), p53 and MDC1 protein expressions, but increased the protein expression of p-p53 and p-H2AX. Protein translocation was examined by confocal laser microscopy, and we found that kaempferol increased the levels of p-H2AX and p-p53 in HL-60 cells. Taken together, in the present study, we found that kaempferol induced DNA damage and suppressed DNA repair and inhibited DNA repair associated protein expression in HL-60 cells, which may be the factors for kaempferol induced cell death in vitro.","['Wu, Lung-Yuan', 'Lu, Hsu-Feng', 'Chou, Yu-Cheng', 'Shih, Yung-Luen', 'Bau, Da-Tian', 'Chen, Jaw-Chyun', 'Hsu, Shu-Chun', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Wu LY', 'Lu HF', 'Chou YC', 'Shih YL', 'Bau DT', 'Chen JC', 'Hsu SC', 'Chung JG']","['I-Shou University, The School of Chinese Medicine for Post Baccalaureate, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150317,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Chemoprevention', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', '*Flavonoids', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaempferols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phytotherapy', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1142/S0192415X1550024X [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2015;43(2):365-82. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X1550024X.

A total of 64 pediatric patients transplanted from HLA-matched family donors were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients received G-CSF primed marrow (G-BM group) and 35 patients received steady state bone marrow (S-BM group). Number of total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34(+) cells, CFU-GM colony number, neutrophil and platelet engraftment times, total length of stay in hospital, overall and disease free survival, and occasions of acute and chronic GvHD has been compared between these two groups. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor primed bone marrow (G-BM) yielded higher numbers of CD34(+) cells, TNCs, and CFU-GM colony numbers compared to those obtained in S-BM. The neutrophil engraftment time, platelet engraftment time, length of stay in hospital, overall survival and disease free survival were not different between G-BM and S-BM groups. Also the cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute and chronic GvHD were similar. It was observed that the use of G-CSF did not increase the risk of acute or chronic GvHD.

However, its function in the mammalian somatic cells remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that a piRNA derived from Growth Arrest Specific 5, a tumor-suppressive long non-coding RNA, potently upregulates the transcription of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a proapoptotic protein, by inducing H3K4 methylation/H3K27 demethylation. Interestingly, the PIWIL1/4 proteins, which bind with this piRNA, directly interact with WDR5, resulting in a site-specific recruitment of the hCOMPASS-like complexes containing at least MLL3 and UTX (KDM6A). We have indicated a novel pathway for piRNAs to specially activate gene expression. Given that MLL3 or UTX are frequently mutated in various tumors, the piRNA/MLL3/UTX complex mediates the induction of TRAIL, and consequently leads to the inhibition of tumor growth.","['He, Xin',

Recent studies have indicated that an interaction between the SH2 (Src-homology 2) domain and the N-lobe (N-terminal lobe) of the c-Abl kinase domain (KD) has a critical role in leukaemogenesis [Grebien et al. (2011) Cell 147, 306-319; Sherbenou et al. (2010) Blood 116, 3278-3285]. To dissect the structural basis of this phenomenon, we studied c-Abl constructs comprising the SH2 and KDs in vitro. We present a crystal structure of an SH2-KD construct bound to dasatinib, which contains the relevant interface between the SH2 domain and the N-lobe of the KD. We show that the presence of the SH2 domain enhances kinase activity moderately and that this effect depends on contacts in the SH2/N-lobe interface and is abrogated by specific mutations. Consistently, formation of the interface decreases slightly the association rate of imatinib with the KD. That the effects are small compared with the dramatic in vivo consequences suggests an important function of the SH2-N-lobe interaction might be to help disassemble the auto-inhibited conformation of c-Abl and promote processive phosphorylation, rather than substantially stimulate kinase activity.","['Lorenz, Sonja', 'Deng, Patricia', 'Hantschel, Oliver', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Kuriyan, John']","['Lorenz S', 'Deng P', 'Hantschel O', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Kuriyan J']","['*California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A.', 'daggerDepartment of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A.', 'double daggerCeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Lazarettgasse 14, AKH BT 25.3, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'double daggerCeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Lazarettgasse 14, AKH BT 25.3, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', '*California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', '*src Homology Domains']",PMC5936049,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20141492 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20141492 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2015 Jun 1;468(2):283-91. doi: 10.1042/BJ20141492.,,,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],['HHMIMS951371'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that adoptively transferred IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells suppress GvHD in a mouse model of fully mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation. These IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells maintained Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet expression upon transfer and, while there was no evidence of direct killing of donor T cells or host DCs by the IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells, proliferation of donor T cells was inhibited. Strikingly, the graft versus leukemia effect mediated by donor T cells was retained, resulting in improved overall survival of mice that received lymphoma cells, donor allogeneic T cells, and IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells. These results suggest that IL-12/15/18-preactivated NK cells may be useful in improving immunotherapy of mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation. Compared with previously proposed protocols, our findings suggest that in vitro NK-cell preactivation with this cytokine cocktail offers the significant advantage that cytokines do not need to be administered systemically to sustain NK-cell activity, thus avoiding toxicity.","['Huber, Christian M', 'Doisne, Jean-Marc', 'Colucci, Francesco']","['Huber CM', 'Doisne JM', 'Colucci F']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150417,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Eomes protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-18/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4687420,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201445200 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2015 Jun;45(6):1727-35. doi: 10.1002/eji.201445200.

METHODS: Fifty-five AML patients received allo-HSCT were retrospectively reviewed. Relapse rate and overall survival (OS) were analyzed according to cGVHD. RESULTS: cGVHD significantly decreased the relapse rate of AML patients after transplantation within 2 years when compared with those without cGVHD (8.7% vs 38.6%, P=0.019), however, cGVHD had no effect on the long-term relapse rate (22.8% vs 5.9%, P=0.217). cGVHD had no effect on OS within 2 years (78.3% vs 61.0%, P=0.155) but could decrease the rate of long-term survival (63.7% vs 100%,P=0.01). cGVHD also could reduce the rate of relapse (8.3% vs 46.2%, P=0.044) and enhanced the rate of survival (83.3% vs 47.2%, P=0.045) in patients with high risk AML after allo-HSCT in 2 years, while it had no effect on the relapse rate and OS in patients with low and intermediated risk AML in early and late phase. Moreover, compared with the rate of relapse(38.6%) in patients without cGVHD, the rate of relapse were lower in patients with limited cGVHD and intensive cGVHD (27.3% and 31.3%, respectively) but the long-term survival was significantly lower (53.3%, P=0.001) in those patients with intensive cGVHD after all-HSCT.

METHODS: From April 2004 to December 2013, 397 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML (acute promyelocytic leukemia excluded) received the idarubicin combined with cytarabine (IA)""3+7"" regimen as the first induction chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. Therapeutic effect, relapse and survival of these patients were discussed. Patients underwent continuous consolidation chemotherapy, and some eligible patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the first complete remission. RESULTS: Of 397 patients, 347 evaluable patients achieved CR after 1-4 cycles induction chemotherapy.The median follow-up was 18.0 (2.4-115.4) months in survivors, the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years were 33.0%, 58.6% and 67.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that unfavorable cytogenetics, more cycles to achieve CR and post-remission treatment without allo-HSCT were independent risk factors affecting DFS and OS. FLT3-ITD mutation positive was another independent risk factor affecting DFS. There was no statistic difference between patients who achieved CR after one cycle (n=255) and two cycles (n=73) treatment in DFS and OS (P>0.05). DFS and OS in patients who achieved CR after 3 or 4 cycles(n=19)were significantly lower than the above two groups (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis among 183 patients who received consistent chemotherapy showed that achieving CR within 2 cycles was the favorable factor affecting DFS and OS (P=0.001, P=0.035).

Till now, the precise mechanism of GC resistance remains unclear. In the present study, dexamethasone (Dex) inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase, and induced apoptosis in Dex-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, Dex failed to cause cell death in Dex-resistant lymphoid malignant cells. Intriguingly, we found that autophagy was induced by Dex in resistant cells, as indicated by autophagosomes formation, LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, p62 degradation, and formation of acidic autophagic vacuoles. Moreover, the results showed that Dex reduced the activity of mTOR pathway, as determined by decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR, Akt, P70S6K and 4E-BP1 in resistant cells. Inhibition of autophagy by either chloroquine (CQ) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA) overcame Dex-resistance in lymphoid malignant cells by increasing apoptotic cell death in vitro.

This results in progressive bone marrow failure and predisposes to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The molecular mechanisms responsible for these defects are largely unknown. Using Ercc1-deficient mice, we show that Trp53 is responsible for ICL-induced bone marrow failure and that loss of Trp53 is leukemogenic in this model. In addition, Ercc1-deficient myeloid progenitors gain elevated levels of miR-139-3p and miR-199a-3p with age. These microRNAs exert opposite effects on hematopoiesis. Ectopic expression of miR-139-3p strongly inhibited proliferation of myeloid progenitors, whereas inhibition of miR-139-3p activity restored defective proliferation of Ercc1-deficient progenitors. Conversely, the inhibition of miR-199a-3p functions aggravated the myeloid proliferation defect in the Ercc1-deficient model, whereas its enforced expression enhanced proliferation of progenitors. Importantly, miR-199a-3p caused AML in a pre-leukemic mouse model, supporting its role as an onco-microRNA. Target genes include HuR for miR-139-3p and Prdx6, Runx1, and Suz12 for miR-199a-3p. The latter genes have previously been implicated as tumor suppressors in de novo and secondary AML. These findings show that, in addition to TRP53-controlled mechanisms, miR-139-3p and miR-199a-3p are involved in the defective hematopoietic function of ICL-repair deficient myeloid progenitors.","['Alemdehy, Mir Farshid', 'Haanstra, Jurgen R', 'de Looper, Hans W J', 'van Strien, Paulina M H', 'Verhagen-Oldenampsen, Judith', 'Caljouw, Yvette', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Hoogenboezem, Remco', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'Janssen, George M C', 'Smetsers, Stephanie E', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'von Lindern, Marieke', 'Touw, Ivo P', 'Erkeland, Stefan J']","['Alemdehy MF', 'Haanstra JR', 'de Looper HW', 'van Strien PM', 'Verhagen-Oldenampsen J', 'Caljouw Y', 'Sanders MA', 'Hoogenboezem R', 'de Ru AH', 'Janssen GM', 'Smetsers SE', 'Bierings MB', 'van Veelen PA', 'von Lindern M', 'Touw IP', 'Erkeland SJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', ""Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and."", ""Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN139 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn199 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ercc1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endonucleases/deficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/08/27 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31532-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-612507 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 18;125(25):3937-48. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-612507.

One hallmark of malignant cells is metabolic reprogramming, which is mostly represented by a glycolytic shift known as the Warburg effect. Because treatment resistance can be linked to metabolic alterations, we investigated whether bone marrow stromal cells impact the bioenergetics of primary CLL cells. In fact, stromal contact led to an increase of aerobic glycolysis and the cells' overall glycolytic capacity accompanied by an increased glucose uptake, expression of glucose transporter, and glycolytic enzymes. Activation of Notch signaling and of its direct transcriptional target c-Myc contributed to this metabolic switch. Based on these observations, CLL cells' acquired increased glucose dependency as well as Notch-c-Myc signaling could be therapeutically exploited in an effort to overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance.","['Jitschin, Regina', 'Braun, Martina', 'Qorraj, Mirjeta', 'Saul, Domenica', 'Le Blanc, Katarina', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Jitschin R', 'Braun M', 'Qorraj M', 'Saul D', 'Le Blanc K', 'Zenz T', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; and Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Respiration/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Glycolysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31607-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-607036 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 28;125(22):3432-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-607036.

The mutant enzyme is thought to convert alpha-ketoglutarate to the pathogenic 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that affects DNA methylation via inhibition of ten-eleven translocation 2. However, the role of wild-type IDH1 in normal hematopoiesis and its relevance to acute myeloid leukemia is unknown. Here we showed that zebrafish idh1 (zidh1) knockdown by morpholino and targeted mutagenesis by transcription activator-like effector nuclease might induce blockade in myeloid differentiation, as evident by an increase in pu.1 and decrease in mpo, l-plastin, and mpeg1 expression, and significantly reduce definitive hematopoiesis. Morpholino knockdown of zidh2 also induced a blockade in myeloid differentiation but definitive hematopoiesis was not affected. The hematopoietic phenotype of zidh1 knockdown was not rescuable by zidh2 messenger RNA, suggesting nonredundant functions. Overexpression of human IDH1-R132H or its zebrafish ortholog resulted in 2-HG elevation and expansion of myelopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. A human IDH1-R132H-specific inhibitor (AGI-5198) significantly ameliorated both hematopoietic and 2-HG responses in human but not zebrafish IDH1 mutant expression. The results provided important insights to the role of zidh1 in myelopoiesis and definitive hematopoiesis and of IDH1-R132H in leukemogenesis.","['Shi, Xiangguo', 'He, Bai-Liang', 'Ma, Alvin C H', 'Guo, Yuhan', 'Chi, Yali', 'Man, Cheuk Him', 'Zhang, Wenqing', 'Zhang, Yiyue', 'Wen, Zilong', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Leung, Anskar Y H']","['Shi X', 'He BL', 'Ma AC', 'Guo Y', 'Chi Y', 'Man CH', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang Y', 'Wen Z', 'Cheng T', 'Leung AY']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China;', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China;', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China;', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China;', 'Department of Cell Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China;', 'Department of Cell Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Cell Biology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; and Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AGI-5198)', '0 (Benzeneacetamides)', '0 (Glutarates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Benzeneacetamides/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glutarates/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Zebrafish/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31719-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-601187 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 7;125(19):2974-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-601187.

The risk of complications is higher in acute than in chronic leukemias, and particularly leukostasis occurs more often in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for several reasons. Only a small proportion of AML patients present with HL, but these patients have a particularly dismal prognosis because of (1) a higher risk of early death resulting from HL complications; and (2) a higher probability of relapse and death in the long run.

The clinical course is aggressive with short remissions and reduced overall survival. The diagnostic criteria are based on the percentage (>20%) and absolute number (2 x 10(9) /L) of plasma cells in peripheral blood. After establishing diagnosis, induction therapy should begin promptly which is aimed to rapid disease control and to minimize the risk of early death.

It has been used in the clinical treatment of leukemia. 67kDa laminin receptor (67LR), as one of the receptor of laminin, plays an important role in tumor cells invasion, proliferation and metastasis. Current research indicates that 67LR is highly expressed in glioma and is associated with tumor progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially the signaling pathways involved, have not been reported yet. Therefore it is of great importance to clarify its downstream targets. METHODS: The U251 glioma cell line was used in this study. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used in cell proliferation assay. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the transcription level of dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphorylated MAPKs. RESULTS: 67LR could influence the transcription of DUSPs and expression of MAPKs. ATRA could enhance the expression of 67LR in U251 cells and this enhancement was dose-dependent. ATRA was able to inhibit the growth of U251 cells. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA expressed significant therapeutic effect on glioma cells, and 67LR is not the only factor that can influence the proliferation of U251 cells.","['Jiang, Li', 'Zhang, Can', 'Wu, Yue', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Ji, Yonghua', 'Chen, Fuxue']","['Jiang L', 'Zhang C', 'Wu Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Ji Y', 'Chen F']","['School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, .R.

At present 6 types of parasporins are identified and characterized. This review summarizes the properties of these new potentially useful antitumor agents of natural origin. Various types of parasporins possess unique cytotoxic mechanisms against cancer cells. The cytotoxic activity for cancer cells makes parasporins possible candidates for anticancer agents in clinical oncology. Recently, genetic engineering was applied for the production of parasporins and the gene responsible for the production of the proteins was expressed in E. coli.

We show that in hESCs the expression of the Notch ligand DLL4 is induced during hematopoietic differentiation. We found that DLL4 is only expressed in a sub-population of bipotent hematoendothelial progenitors (HEPs) and segregates their hematopoietic versus endothelial potential. We demonstrate at the clonal level and through transcriptome analyses that DLL4(high) HEPs are enriched in endothelial potential, whereas DLL4(low/-) HEPs are committed to the hematopoietic lineage, albeit both populations still contain bipotent cells. Moreover, DLL4 stimulation enhances hematopoietic differentiation of HEPs and increases the amount of clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors. Confocal microscopy analysis of whole differentiating embryoid bodies revealed that DLL4(high) HEPs are located close to DLL4(low/-) HEPs, and at the base of clusters of CD45+ cells, resembling intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters found in mouse embryos. We propose a model for human embryonic hematopoiesis in which DLL4(low/-) cells within hemogenic endothelium receive Notch-activating signals from DLL4(high) cells, resulting in an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and their differentiation into CD45+ hematopoietic cells.","['Ayllon, V', 'Bueno, C', 'Ramos-Mejia, V', 'Navarro-Montero, O', 'Prieto, C', 'Real, P J', 'Romero, T', 'Garcia-Leon, M J', 'Toribio, M L', 'Bigas, A', 'Menendez, P']","['Ayllon V', 'Bueno C', 'Ramos-Mejia V', 'Navarro-Montero O', 'Prieto C', 'Real PJ', 'Romero T', 'Garcia-Leon MJ', 'Toribio ML', 'Bigas A', 'Menendez P']","['Gene Regulation, Stem Cells & Development Laboratory, GENyO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer/University of Granada/Andalusian Regional Government, Granada, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Gene Regulation, Stem Cells & Development Laboratory, GENyO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer/University of Granada/Andalusian Regional Government, Granada, Spain.', 'Gene Regulation, Stem Cells & Development Laboratory, GENyO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer/University of Granada/Andalusian Regional Government, Granada, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Gene Regulation, Stem Cells & Development Laboratory, GENyO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer/University of Granada/Andalusian Regional Government, Granada, Spain.', 'Gene Regulation, Stem Cells & Development Laboratory, GENyO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer/University of Granada/Andalusian Regional Government, Granada, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM-SO), CSIC-UAM, Campus de la Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM-SO), CSIC-UAM, Campus de la Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain."", '1] Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain [2] Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150317,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (delta protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryoid Bodies', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Endothelium/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201574 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1741-53. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.74.

The present study used direct sequencing to screen 20 malignancy-associated genes, which have either been well described in the literature or observed multiple times in human cancer sequencing, in cancerous and normal control tissue samples from 20 patients with histologically confirmed GBM. The investigation identified five somatic non-synonymous coding mutations in four candidate genes, with two located in the proline, glutamic acid, serine, threonine-rich region of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl)-1, (D155G and L174S). The sample pool was then expanded by sequencing Mcl-1 in a further 43 patients with GBM and another somatic mutation in the same region, D155H, was identified. The subsequent functional investigation confirmed that these somatic mutations affected the degradation of Mcl-1, and the growth of glioma cells transfected with mutant plasmids was significantly accelerated compared with cells overexpressing wild-type Mcl-1. The mutational profiling of GBM in the present study revealed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, several mutations in Mcl-1, and identified this gene as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of GBM.","['Lv, Xiupeng', 'Tan, Guang', 'Yao, Yiqun', 'Lv, Li', 'Deng, Xiaoqin', 'Dong, Lei', 'Li, Shuang', 'Li, Linlin', 'Xu, Yinghui']","['Lv X', 'Tan G', 'Yao Y', 'Lv L', 'Deng X', 'Dong L', 'Li S', 'Li L', 'Xu Y']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116011, P.R.

In adults ALL comprises approximately 20 % of all forms of acute leukemia. In recent years substantial progress has been made with respect to the characterization and therapy optimization based on consecutive therapy optimization studies with increasingly more individualized, risk-adapted therapy protocols. Approximately 90 % of adult ALL patients under 55-65 years can now achieve complete remission. The chance of cure for adults could be increased over the last 30 years from less than 10 % to more than 50 %. Fundamental for the improvement of therapy results were an optimization of intensive chemotherapy and supportive treatment, integration of stem cell transplantation into the first-line treatment, inclusion of targeted substances in the therapy concept and improved risk stratification in consideration of the course of the minimal residual disease. Due to individualized therapeutic decisions current therapy protocols are very complex and can only be adequately carried out in specialized centers.

No curative treatment is currently available for this disease. TREATMENT: Advanced disease is treated according to the patients' fitness and comorbidity burden as well as according the presence of high risk genetic factors in CLL cells. The detection of del(17p) and/or TP53 gene mutations reflects a very unfavorable prognosis and refractoriness to chemotherapy (very high risk CLL). In physically fit patients without high comorbidity burden and without very high risk prognostic factors, chemoimmunotherapy containing fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and the CD20 antibody rituximab (FCR) is standard therapy because this regimen has been shown to improve overall survival. In patients with significant comorbidity burden, a less intense chemoimmunotherapy regimen should be administered consisting of the alkylating agent chlorambucil plus CD20 antibody. In very high risk patients, kinase inhibitors blocking the signaling transduction pathway of the B cell receptor have been approved since 2014. The same substances are also approved in relapsed CLL. However, in relapsed CLL repetitive administration of chemoimmunotherapy is still an alternative treatment option, especially if the first remission was longer lasting (> 24 months). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in very high risk CLL or early relapsed disease has become less important than in the past. In some patients considering the risk of the transplantation versus the risk of failing to respond to the new treatment option, this procedure might still be the treatment of choice in order to achieve long-lasting remissions. CONCLUSION: In the choice of treatment for patients with CLL, several factors must be considered. Because of the broad spectrum of treatment options, therapy within a clinical study is still the best treatment option.","['Eichhorst, B', 'Hallek, M']","['Eichhorst B', 'Hallek M']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Centrum fur Integrierte Onkologie Koln Bonn, Universitat Koln, Kerpener Str. 62, 50924, Koln, Deutschland, barbara.eichhorst@uk-koeln.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods']",,2015/03/18 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00108-014-3593-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Internist (Berl). 2015 Apr;56(4):374-80. doi: 10.1007/s00108-014-3593-8.,,,,,,,,,Chronische lymphatische Leukamie : Therapiekonzepte im Wandel.,['Internist (Berl). 2017 Oct;58(10 ):1124.

This apoptotic effect is mediated by interaction of TRAIL and its receptors, which include Death Receptor 4 (DR4) and Death Receptor 5 (DR5). Some antibodies to DR4 or DR5 do not have anti-tumor ability without cross-linking but exhibit anti-tumor ability in the presence of a cross-linking reagent. Here, we suggest that the tetravalent anti-DR5 antibody can induce apoptosis of cancer cells independent of cross-linking reagent. The single-chain variable fragment of the anti-DR5 antibody, HSA (human serum albumin) - p53 gene, comprising residues 490-513 of HSA and the tetramerization domain of human p53 were assembled into the tetravalent antibody by an overlapping PCR. Results of size exclusion HPLC indicated that the purified protein exhibited a major peak (tetramer) and a minor peak (dimer). MTT assay demonstrated the tetravalent antibody without cross-linking could inhibit survival of Jurkat and EC9706 cells in a dose-dependent manner while the monovalent antibody could not inhibit survival of Jurkat and EC9706 cells. IC50 of Jurkat cell was 3.2 mg/L and IC50 of EC9706 cell was 3.9 mg/L. Furthermore, the Annexin V/PI assay and the Hoechst 33258 staining showed that the tetravalent antibody could efficiently induce apoptosis of Jurkat and EC9706 cells. Therefore, the tetravalent anti-DR5 antibody can act as a direct agonistic antibody, and initiate efficient apoptotic independent of cross-linking reagent. Thus, the tetravalent anti-DR5 antibody will be a new kind of candidate for potential cancer therapeutics.","['Liu, Fengtao', 'Si, Yanmin', 'Liu, Guangchao', 'Li, Shulian', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Ma, Yuanfang']","['Liu F', 'Si Y', 'Liu G', 'Li S', 'Zhang J', 'Ma Y']","['Laboratory of antibody engineering, Institute of Immunology, Collage of Medicine, Henan University, 475004 Kaifeng, PR China.', 'Laboratory of antibody engineering, Institute of Immunology, Collage of Medicine, Henan University, 475004 Kaifeng, PR China.', 'Laboratory of antibody engineering, Institute of Immunology, Collage of Medicine, Henan University, 475004 Kaifeng, PR China.', 'Laboratory of antibody engineering, Institute of Immunology, Collage of Medicine, Henan University, 475004 Kaifeng, PR China.', 'Laboratory of antibody engineering, Institute of Immunology, Collage of Medicine, Henan University, 475004 Kaifeng, PR China.', 'Laboratory of antibody engineering, Institute of Immunology, Collage of Medicine, Henan University, 475004 Kaifeng, PR China.

The use of targeted intravenous (I.V.) busulfan has significantly improved the tolerability and efficacy of this regimen. We designed a dose-escalation study to examine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of targeted I.V. busulfan with bolus etoposide as preparative therapy for autologous HSCT in AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single-center, phase I study, adult AML patients received I.V. busulfan targeted to either an area under the curve (AUC) of 1250 (cohort 1) or 1400 (cohort 2) mumol/min over 16 doses. Dose adjustments based on plasma pharmacokinetics occurred before doses 2 and 11. Etoposide 60 mg/kg I.V. was administered 24 hours after the last busulfan dose and 3 days before stem cell infusion. RESULTS: Twelve patients with intermediate-risk AML in first complete remission were treated. All patients in cohort 1 and 5 patients (83%) in cohort 2 were within 10% of the target AUC. The MTD was not reached, although Grade >/= 3 mucositis occurred in 3 patients (50%) in cohort 1 and in 4 patients (66%) in cohort 2, limiting further dose escalation. Two-year relapse-free survival was 33% in cohort 1 versus 67% in cohort 2 (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Etoposide and targeted, dose-escalated I.V. busulfan as myeloablative therapy for autologous HSCT in AML is safe, with mucositis being the most significant toxicity. A phase II study is warranted to further evaluate the activity and safety of busulfan targeted to AUC 1400 mumol/min.","['Mannis, Gabriel N', 'Andreadis, Charalambos', 'Logan, Aaron C', 'Damon, Lloyd E', 'Benet, Leslie Z', 'Ai, Weiyun Z', 'Gaensler, Karin M L', 'Kaplan, Lawrence D', 'Koplowicz, Yelena B', 'Linker, Charles A', 'Olin, Rebecca L', 'Sayre, Peter H', 'Smith, Catherine C', 'Sudhindra, Akshay', 'Venstrom, Jeffrey M', 'Wolf, Jeffrey L', 'Martin, Thomas G 3rd']","['Mannis GN', 'Andreadis C', 'Logan AC', 'Damon LE', 'Benet LZ', 'Ai WZ', 'Gaensler KM', 'Kaplan LD', 'Koplowicz YB', 'Linker CA', 'Olin RL', 'Sayre PH', 'Smith CC', 'Sudhindra A', 'Venstrom JM', 'Wolf JL', 'Martin TG 3rd']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, CA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I study of azacitidine (intravenous 75 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days) with escalating doses of oral midostaurin (25 mg twice per day [b.i.d.], 50 mg b.i.d., and 75 mg b.i.d.) on days 8 to 21 of a 28-day cycle in untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in older patients and/or relapsed AML. Patients were eligible regardless of FLT3 mutation status. Trough blood samples for pharmacokinetics were obtained on days 8, 15, and 21 before midostaurin dosing. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with a median age of 73 (range, 57-83) years were enrolled; 5 patients had previous conventional treatment and none of the patients had FLT3 mutations. Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed. Hospitalizations, primarily for infections, occurred in one-third of treatment cycles. Fourteen patients were evaluable for response: 3 attained complete remission and 2 had hematologic improvement. Median (range) survival from enrollment was 6 (1 to >/= 19) months. Three patients died within 60 days of enrollment (2 progressive disease, 1 non-dose-limiting toxicity, treatment-related). Pharmacokinetic data at 75 mg orally b.i.d. showed increased trough levels of midostaurin during cycle 2 compared with cycle 1 and persistent and increasing levels of its active metabolite, CGP52421. CONCLUSION: The combination of sequential azacitidine and midostaurin is safe and tolerable with response rates comparable with azacitidine alone and should be studied further in FLT3 mutation-positive AML.","['Cooper, Brenda W', 'Kindwall-Keller, Tamila L', 'Craig, Michael D', 'Creger, Richard J', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Tse, William W', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Cooper BW', 'Kindwall-Keller TL', 'Craig MD', 'Creger RJ', 'Hamadani M', 'Tse WW', 'Lazarus HM']","['Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals, Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.

We investigated the molecular control of cell survival of two main DC subsets: plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs) and their dependence on individual antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members. Compared with cDCs, pDCs had higher expression of BCL-2, lower A1, and similar levels of MCL-1 and BCL-XL. Transgenic overexpression of BCL-2 increased the pDC pool size in vivo with only minor impact on cDCs. With a view to immune intervention, we tested BCL-2 inhibitors and found that ABT-199 (the BCL-2 specific inhibitor) selectively killed pDCs but not cDCs. Conversely, genetic knockdown of A1 profoundly reduced the proportion of cDCs but not pDCs. We also found that conditional ablation of MCL-1 significantly reduced the size of both DC populations in mice and impeded DC-mediated immune responses. Thus, we revealed that the two DC types have different cell survival requirements.

We hypothesized that overcoming this differentiation block by forcing cells to reprogram to the myeloid lineage would reduce the leukemogenicity of these cells. We found that primary human BCR-ABL1(+) B-ALL cells could be induced to reprogram into macrophage-like cells by exposure to myeloid differentiation-promoting cytokines in vitro or by transient expression of the myeloid transcription factor C/EBPalpha or PU.1. The resultant cells were clonally related to the primary leukemic blasts but resembled normal macrophages in appearance, immunophenotype, gene expression, and function. Most importantly, these macrophage-like cells were unable to establish disease in xenograft hosts, indicating that lineage reprogramming eliminates the leukemogenicity of BCR-ABL1(+) B-ALL cells, and suggesting a previously unidentified therapeutic strategy for this disease. Finally, we determined that myeloid reprogramming may occur to some degree in human patients by identifying primary CD14(+) monocytes/macrophages in BCR-ABL1(+) B-ALL patient samples that possess the BCR-ABL1(+) translocation and clonally recombined VDJ regions.","['McClellan, James Scott', 'Dove, Christopher', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Ryan, Christine E', 'Majeti, Ravindra']","['McClellan JS', 'Dove C', 'Gentles AJ', 'Ryan CE', 'Majeti R']","['Departments of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and.', 'Departments of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and.', 'Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Departments of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and.', 'Departments of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and rmajeti@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150316,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis']",PMC4386392,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1413383112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1413383112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Mar 31;112(13):4074-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1413383112.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD22, is one of the most promising monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the current literature of IO in adult leukemias and lymphomas. EXPERT OPINION: Single-agent IO has demonstrated activity in patients with relapsed B-cell ALL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It has also demonstrated favorable early results when combined with chemotherapy in older patients with ALL. There is potential for IO to be combined with other targeted therapies under development for these diseases; data are still early and further studies of IO are warranted. While the pivotal randomized study of IO for relapsed NHL versus physician's choice did not show a statistically significant advantage in response rate, the results of the pivotal study in ALL are not yet available.","['Ohanian, Maro', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Guy, Daniel', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Jabbour, Elias', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Ohanian M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Guy D', 'Thomas D', 'Jabbour E', ""O'Brien S""]","['University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2015.1024652 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015 Apr;15(4):601-11. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2015.1024652.,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'inotuzumab ozogamicin', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015 Jun;15(6):915.

In this retrospective study patients were risk-stratified for LTLS based on SUA cut-off values and the discrimination ability was compared to current prediction models. The incidences of LTLS were 17.8%, 21% and 62.5% in the low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively. SUA was an independent predictor of LTLS (adjusted OR 1.12, CI95% 1.0-1.3, p = 0.048). The discriminatory ability of SUA, per ROC curves, to predict LTLS was superior to LDH, cytogenetic profile, tumor markers and the combined model but not to WBC (AUCWBC 0.679). However, in comparisons between high-risk SUA and high-risk WBC, SUA had superior discriminatory capability than WBC (AUCSUA 0.664 vs. AUCWBC 0.520; p <0.001). SUA also demonstrated better performance than the prediction models (high-risk SUAAUC 0.695, p<0.001). In direct comparison of high-risk groups, SUA again demonstrated superior performance than the prediction models (high-risk SUAAUC 0.668, p = 0.001) in predicting LTLS, approaching that of the combined model (AUC 0.685, p<0.001). In conclusion, SUA alone is comparable and highly predictive for LTLS than other prediction models.","['Ejaz, A Ahsan', 'Pourafshar, Negiin', 'Mohandas, Rajesh', 'Smallwood, Bryan A', 'Johnson, Richard J', 'Hsu, Jack W']","['Ejaz AA', 'Pourafshar N', 'Mohandas R', 'Smallwood BA', 'Johnson RJ', 'Hsu JW']","['Division of Nephrology, Hypertension and Transplantation, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.', 'Division of Nephrology, Hypertension and Transplantation, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.', 'Division of Nephrology, Hypertension and Transplantation, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America; Nephrology & Hypertension Section, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health and Health Professions and the College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.', 'Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150316,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/epidemiology/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",PMC4361475,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119497 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-43275 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 16;10(3):e0119497. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119497. eCollection 2015.,,,,['I01 BX002586/BX/BLRD VA/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-intense chemotherapy regimens investigated in small single institution trials, but with the exception of bone marrow transplantation for a minority of patients, little has improved the median overall survival of patients with RS beyond eight months. Patients are often elderly, immunosuppressed, possess co-morbidities and have a deteriorating performance status. TP53 disruption is a common molecular abnormality noted in RS and contributes to the tumour's chemotherapy resistance. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal IgG1kappa antibody that targets a unique epitope on B lymphocytes. It has displayed increased binding affinity and a longer dissociation time when compared to rituximab resulting in improved complement dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC); a mechanism with the potential to overcome apoptosis-resistance in TP53 disruption. Given the prevalence of TP53 disruption in RS, Ofatumumab was considered a relatively non-toxic agent with a sound rationale to test in a prospective multicentre trial as an adjunct to CHOP induction and subsequent ofatumumab maintenance therapy in responding patients. METHODS/DESIGN: The CHOP-OR study is a prospective phase II study to evaluate the safety, feasibility and activity of a CHOP chemotherapy in combination with ofatumumab in induction and subsequent maintenance for patients with newly diagnosed RS. The primary objective will be the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with RS after six cycles of CHOP-O. The secondary objectives include feasibility of recruitment, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. The study will be accompanied by exploratory analysis of the genomic landscape of RS in newly diagnosed patients. DISCUSSION: The CHOP-OR trial evaluates the safety, feasibility and activity of CHOP plus Ofatumumab induction and Ofatumumab maintenance in new RS patients. The study is currently recruiting and has met the interim analysis criteria, with more than 7 of the first 25 participants achieving a CR or PR after six cycles of CHOP-O. The study has the potential to identify predictive biomarkers for this treatment modality.

However, the mechanisms mediating the persistence of complete donor chimerism are poorly understood. The frequent coincidence of complete donor chimerism with graft-versus-leukemia effects and graft-versus-host disease suggests that immune responses against minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) are playing an important role in suppressing the host hematopoiesis after allogeneic SCT. Here, we investigated a possible relationship between donor immune responses against the hematopoiesis-restricted mHag HA-1 and the long-term kinetics of host hematopoietic chimerism in a cohort of 10 patients after allogeneic HLA-matched, HA-1 mismatched SCT. Functional HA-1 specific CTLs (HA-1 CTLs) were detectable in 6/10 patients lysing host-type hematopoietic cells in vitro. Presence of HA-1 CTLs in the peripheral blood coincided with low host hematopoiesis levels quantified by highly sensitive mHag specific PCR. Additionally, co-incubation of host type CD34+ cells with HA-1 CTLs isolated after allogeneic SCT prevented progenitor and cobblestone area forming cell growth in vitro and human hematopoietic engraftment in immunodeficient mice. Conversely, absence or loss of HA-1 CTLs mostly coincided with high host hematopoiesis levels and/or relapse. In summary, in this first study, presence of HA-1 CTLs paralleled low host hematopoiesis levels. This coincidence might be supported by the capacity of HA-1 CTLs isolated after allogeneic SCT to specifically eliminate host type hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Additional studies involving multiple mismatched mHags in more patients are required to confirm this novel characteristic of mHag CTLs as factor for the persistence of complete donor chimerism and leukemia remission after allogeneic SCT.","['van der Torren, Cornelis R', 'van Hensbergen, Yvette', 'Luther, Susanne', 'Aghai, Zohara', 'Rychnavska, Zuzana Stachova', 'Slot, Manon', 'Scherjon, Sicco', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Weissinger, Eva M', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Hambach, Lothar']","['van der Torren CR', 'van Hensbergen Y', 'Luther S', 'Aghai Z', 'Rychnavska ZS', 'Slot M', 'Scherjon S', 'Kroger N', 'Ganser A', 'Weissinger EM', 'Goulmy E', 'Hambach L']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, Division of Research, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, Division of Research, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4361395,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119595 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-38028 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 16;10(3):e0119595. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119595. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially the patient received 1 course of cladribine upon which the disease went into complete remission. 6 weeks ago a relapse was diagnosed and combination therapy with cladibrin and rituximab was initiated. Now the patient presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and pain when breathing. INVESTIGATIONS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: In the chest x-ray, patchy infiltrates and pleural effusions were found on both sides. The subsequently performed computed tomography showed bilateral compactions with an Halo suspicious for fungal infiltrates. Upon admission to the hospital, an empirical antibiotic therapy with clarithromycin and piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated, which was later escalated to meropenem and linezolid. Additionally, an antifungal therapy with voriconazole was started and later switched to liposomal amphotericin B. At his admission, a positive aspergillus antigen could be detected in the microbiological laboratory. Under antimycotic treatment the aspergillus antigen was repeatedly negative. The patient presented with pronounced cytopenias and after a switch of therapy to vemurafenib and filgrastim, the hematopoiesis could only be stimulated insufficiently. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit three days after admission with severe respiratory failure. He died on day 8 after admission. AUTOPSY AND DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis was consistent with relapse of hairy cell leukemia with positive BRAF mutation and a bone marrow infiltration > 80 %. Autopsy revealed a significant hepato-splenomegaly, a lack of erythro-, granulo- and thrombopoiesis. Clots interspersed with fungal hyphae were found in both lungs and an infarction of the spleen with evidence of fungal hyphae was detected. The cultural findings post mortem on yeast or mold were negative. CONCLUSION: Patients with refractory hairy cell leukemia and prolonged neutropenia are at increased risk for systemic fungal infections. Therefore, prohylactic antimycotic therapy should be considered early in this group of patients. The therapeutic approach of vemurafenib in treatment-refractory hairy cell leukemia is promising and offers an additional treatment option. In the present case, the patient could unfortunately not be stabilized due to the septic complications.","['Haap, M', 'Neumayer, B', 'Kopp, H-G', 'Peter, S', 'Haen, S', 'Riessen, R', 'Artunc, F', 'Fend, F', 'Kanz, L', 'Muller, M R']","['Haap M', 'Neumayer B', 'Kopp HG', 'Peter S', 'Haen S', 'Riessen R', 'Artunc F', 'Fend F', 'Kanz L', 'Muller MR']","['Abteilung fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Abteilung fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Abteilung fur Onkologie, Hamatologie, Klinische Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmonologie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Abteilung fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Abteilung fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Abteilung fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.', 'Abteilung fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20150316,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,,IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Neutropenia/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pneumonia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Treatment Failure']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0041-100947 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2015 Mar;140(6):426-7. doi: 10.1055/s-0041-100947.

K63-linked polyubiquitinated Tax activates the IKK complex in the plasma membrane-associated lipid raft microdomain. Tax also interacts with TAX1BP1 to inactivate the NF-kappaB negative regulatory ubiquitin-editing A20 enzyme complex. However, the molecular mechanisms of Tax-mediated IKK activation and A20 protein complex inactivation are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that membrane associated CADM1 (Cell adhesion molecule1) recruits Ubc13 to Tax, causing K63-linked polyubiquitination of Tax, and IKK complex activation in the membrane lipid raft. The c-terminal cytoplasmic tail containing PDZ binding motif of CADM1 is critical for Tax to maintain persistent NF-kappaB activation. Finally, Tax failed to inactivate the NF-kappaB negative regulator ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 complex, and activate the IKK complex in the lipid raft in absence of CADM1. Our results thus indicate that CADM1 functions as a critical scaffold molecule for Tax and Ubc13 to form a cellular complex with NEMO, TAX1BP1 and NRP, to activate the IKK complex in the plasma membrane-associated lipid rafts, to inactivate NF-kappaB negative regulators, and maintain persistent NF-kappaB activation in HTLV-1 infected cells.","['Pujari, Rajeshree', 'Hunte, Richard', 'Thomas, Remy', 'van der Weyden, Louise', 'Rauch, Dan', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K', 'Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Takai, Yoshimi', 'Shembade, Noula']","['Pujari R', 'Hunte R', 'Thomas R', 'van der Weyden L', 'Rauch D', 'Ratner L', 'Nyborg JK', 'Ramos JC', 'Takai Y', 'Shembade N']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Viral Oncology Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, The University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Viral Oncology Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, The University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Viral Oncology Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, The University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Viral Oncology Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Center for AIDS Research and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Viral Oncology Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, The University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2N protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ube2n protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Tnfaip3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Genes, pX/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism']",PMC4361615,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004721 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-01822 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar 16;11(3):e1004721. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004721. eCollection 2015 Mar.,,,,"['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '13031/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA128115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median duration from transplant to 5-azacytidine was 289 days (range 59-2133). Response criteria: CR, temporary disease control or treatment failure. A median of 2.7 courses (range 1-10) were administered; 65 out of 72 patients also received DLI (41 already before 5-azacytidine). Ten patients developed acute GVHD and two succumbed to treatment-related sepsis. CR rate was 9.7% (in two patients lasting >5 years), 44% had temporary disease control (median duration 71 days, range 31-380). Median survival from 5-azacytidine was 108 days, 21 patients proceeded to subsequent transplant. In multivariate analysis, peripheral blood blasts <1% were predictive of longer OS (P=0.03). Taken together, long-term remissions can be induced by this well-tolerated outpatient treatment, particularly in patients without peripheral blood blasts.","['Steinmann, J', 'Bertz, H', 'Wasch, R', 'Marks, R', 'Zeiser, R', 'Bogatyreva, L', 'Finke, J', 'Lubbert, M']","['Steinmann J', 'Bertz H', 'Wasch R', 'Marks R', 'Zeiser R', 'Bogatyreva L', 'Finke J', 'Lubbert M']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150316,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201510 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.10 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 May;50(5):690-5. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2015.10.

We evaluated the outcome of patients suffering from hematological malignancies, including acute leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome after allogeneic transplantation. METHODS: All patients having hematological malignancies with HLA identical sibling donors who underwent allogeneic transplantation were included. Pre-transplant workup consisted of complete blood counts, evaluation of liver, kidneys, lungs, infectious profile, chest X-ray, paranasal sinus roentgenograms and dental review. Donors were given G-CSF at a dose of 5-10 mug/kg/twice daily for five days prior to harvest. The conditioning regimens included cyclophosphamide, busulfan and total body irradiation. RESULTS: A total of 41 allogeneic transplants were performed for hematological malignancies from April 2004 to December 2012. There were 31 males and 10 females. Median age +/- SD was 28 +/- 11.7 years (range 8 - 54 years). A mean of 7.7x108+/-1.5 mononuclear cells/kg were infused (range:6.2-9.2x108/kg). The median time to white cell recovery was 19+/-4 days (range:15-23 days). Transplant related mortality was 19.5%. The median overall survival was 53.6 months.

This disease has diversified pathologies and clinical stages that necessitate well optimized clinical management. Regular updates of epidemiological behavior of lymphoma from various parts of the world are available but studies from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in this field are not consistent. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the current trends in presentation and distribution of lymphoma with special reference to incidence and mortality, gender, age, histopathological subtypes, and clinical stages at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH and RC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included lymphoma data from Saudi Cancer Registry, and relative comparison against KFSH and RC tumor registry data, Gulf country data and International Agency for Research on Cancer data. RESULTS: Common tumors in the West (lung, colon, and prostate) were found to be much less frequent in KSA while leukemia, lymphoma and thyroid cancers were more common. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) ranked 3rd most common cancer with age-adjusted incidence of 6/100,000. Estimated age adjusted mortality was 4/100,000 in KSA. There was a peak rise in incidence of lymphoma in 1997-2007. Most common NHL was diffuse large B cell lymphoma at KFSH and RC. A total of 434 cases were diagnosed in 5 years with 55% of them at advanced stage and 35% demonstrating bulky disease and high risk. KFSH and RC registered 35% of Hodgkins and 21% of total NHL identified in entire Saudi Cancer Registry, 2009. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study are very unique, and reveal diverse trends. The findings provide valuable insights in the understanding of current epidemiological features of lymphoma in this part of the world.","['Rauf, Muhammad Shahzad', 'Akhtar, Saad', 'Maghfoor, Irfan']","['Rauf MS', 'Akhtar S', 'Maghfoor I']","['King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Oncology Centre, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia E-mail : mrauf@ kfshrc.edu.sa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.5.2069 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(5):2069-72. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.5.2069.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their presence in the blood and urine also signify their potential use as biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of different diseases. At present, synthesis and release of these vesicles from mammary tumor cells and their role in disease progression requires further research. In this report, correlation of microvesicles along with breast cancer metastasis has been explored. Metastasis is a process of a non-randomized set of events, which begins with a loss of cancer cell adhesion at the primary tumor site. Later on, these cells invade the surrounding tissue and enter into circulation. After compromising host immune response, these cells extravasate and localized at the suitable distant site for a secondary growth. Involvement of microvesicles in modulating this process has also been observed. Microvesicles released from primary cancer cells may carry mRNA, miRNAs, DNA and various proteins. These vesicles may also influence multi drug resistance as observed in breast and leukemia cancer cell lines. A thorough understanding of microvesicles synthesis and their potential implication in metastasis would facilitate the design of novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer.","['Arshad Malik, Muhammad Faraz']",['Arshad Malik MF'],"['Department of Biosciences, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan. famalik@comsats.edu.pk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (ADP-Ribosylation Factor 6)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factor 6', 'ADP-Ribosylation Factors/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood supply/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microvessels/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['0010 [pii]', '0151803/AIM.0010 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2015 Mar;18(3):189-92. doi: 0151803/AIM.0010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion of MLL and its partner genes generates various MLL fusion genes, and their gene products trigger aberrant self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors leading to leukemia. Since the identification of the MLL gene two decades ago, a substantial amount of information has been obtained regarding the mechanisms by which MLL mutations cause leukemia. Wild-type MLL maintains the expression of Homeobox (HOX) genes during development. MLL activates the expression of posterior HOX-A genes in the hematopoietic lineage to stimulate the expansion of immature progenitors. MLL fusion proteins constitutively activate the HOX genes, causing aberrant self-renewal. The modes of transcriptional activation vary depending on the fusion partners and can be categorized into at least four groups. Here I review the recent progress in research related to the molecular mechanisms of MLL fusion-dependent leukemogenesis.","['Yokoyama, Akihiko']",['Yokoyama A'],"['Laboratory for Malignancy Control Research, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan, yokoyama@dsk.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150317,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1774-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Apr;101(4):352-61. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1774-4.

Enhanced cell growth inhibition was observed when the extracts were combined with imatinib. Exposed cells showed cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and cytochrome c release, indicating that the mechanism of cytotoxicity could be via mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathways.

BLV causes malignant lymphoma and lymphosarcoma; however, most BLV infections remain clinically silent in an aleukaemic state. EBL is a notifiable disease, and official control measures include screening or monitoring, precautions at borders, control of movement inside the country, and stamping out. The objective of this study was to evaluate EBL eradication and surveillance measures in Italy from 2005 to 2012. One-hundred twenty-three outbreaks were recorded (1 January 2006 to 31 December 2012) in the National Veterinary Information System (SIMAN) on 7 November 2013. Of these, 101 had occurred in southern Italy. An outbreak usually lasted for a few days, but sometimes lasted for weeks. Some areas were subjected to normal eradication measures, whereas others were subjected to additional eradication measures as a consequence of persisting EBL outbreaks. During the study period, we noted an overall annual decrease from 0.21% in 2005 to 0.08% in 2012 in the herd prevalence rate, from 0.06% in 2005 to 0.04% in 2012 in the herd incidence rate, and from 0.027% in 2005 to 0.015% in 2012 in the animal prevalence rate. Regions officially recognised as EBL-free areas were found to have their own surveillance plans. Differences in their surveillance plans include the type of sample (serum, milk, or both), age at which the animals must be tested (12 or 24 months), and test frequency of herds (annually or every 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 years). The eradication programme for EBL is difficult to implement in some Italian areas because of several factors such as incomplete herd registry, geographical location and socio-economic conditions of the region.","['Maresca, C', 'Costarelli, S', 'Dettori, A', 'Felici, A', 'Iscaro, C', 'Feliziani, F']","['Maresca C', 'Costarelli S', 'Dettori A', 'Felici A', 'Iscaro C', 'Feliziani F']","[""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Umbria e delle Marche, via G.

METHODS: During the past 20 years, the authors have experienced 14 patients with hematological disorders, i.e. leukemia or aplastic anemia, having acute sensorineural hearing loss. An inner ear test battery comprising audiometry and cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), ocular VEMP (oVEMP), and caloric tests was performed. RESULTS: Diagnoses comprised of sudden sensorineural hearing loss in 12 patients and endolymphatic hydrops in four patients (two patients had one ear with sudden sensorineural hearing loss while the other ear had endolymphatic hydrops). Percentages of recruitment phenomenon showed a significant difference between endolymphatic hydrops and sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Abnormal percentages for mean hearing level (86%), cVEMP test (71%), oVEMP test (25%), and caloric test (14%) exhibited a significant sequential decline in these patients. CONCLUSION: Acute sensorineural hearing loss in a patient with leukemia or aplastic anemia may be related to either sudden sensorineural hearing loss or endolymphatic hydrops. A significant sequential decline in the function of the cochlea, saccule, utricle, and semicircular canals indicates that the pars inferior is more vulnerable to blood insult than the pars superior.","['Lin, Chien-Ta', 'Chiang, Ching-Wen', 'Young, Yi-Ho']","['Lin CT', 'Chiang CW', 'Young YH']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Lo Tung Poh-Ai Hospital , Ilan , Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150314,England,Acta Otolaryngol,Acta oto-laryngologica,0370354,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Audiometry', 'Caloric Tests', 'Female', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00016489.2015.1015608 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Otolaryngol. 2015 Jul;135(7):673-80. doi: 10.3109/00016489.2015.1015608.

Scm interacts with Polyhomeotic (a PcG protein) in vitro by recognizing its SPM domain. The homologous human protein, Sex comb on midleg-like 2 (Scml2), has been implicated in malignant brain tumors. Will die slowly (Wds) is another factor that regulates Drosophila development, and its homologous human protein, WD repeat domain 5(Wdr5), is part of the mixed lineage leukemia 1(MLL1) complex that promotes histone H3Lys4 methylation. Like Scml2, Wdr5 has been implicated in certain cancers; this protein plays an important role in leukemogenesis. In this study, we find that loss-of-function mutations in Scm result in non-autonomous tissue overgrowth in Drosophila, and determine that Scm is essential for ommatidium development and important for cell survival in Drosophila. Furthermore, our research suggests a relationship between Wds and Scm; Wds promotes Scm degradation through ubiquitination in vitro in Drosophila.","['Guo, Jiwei', 'Jin, Dan']","['Guo J', 'Jin D']","['College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.

The Ink4a-Arf locus (also known as Cdkn2a), which encodes p16(INK4A) and p19(ARF), has a central role in inducing and maintaining senescence. Given the importance of cellular senescence in restraining tumour growth, great emphasis is being placed on the identification of novel factors that can modulate senescence. The MYST-family histone acetyltransferase MOZ (MYST3, KAT6A), first identified in recurrent translocations in acute myeloid leukaemia, has been implicated in both the promotion and inhibition of senescence. In this study, we investigate the role of MOZ in cellular senescence and show that MOZ is a potent inhibitor of senescence via the INK4A-ARF pathway. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Moz-deficient embryos exhibit premature senescence, which was rescued on the Ink4a-Arf(-/-) background. Importantly, senescence resulting from the absence of MOZ was not accompanied by DNA damage, suggesting that MOZ acts independently of the DNA damage response. Consistent with the importance of senescence in cancer, expression profiling revealed that genes overexpressed in aggressive and highly proliferative cancers are expressed at low levels in Moz-deficient MEFs. We show that MOZ is required to maintain normal levels of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K27 acetylation at the transcriptional start sites of at least four genes, Cdc6, Ezh2, E2f2 and Melk, and normal mRNA levels of these genes. CDC6, EZH2 and E2F2 are known inhibitors of the INK4A-ARF pathway. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that MOZ occupies the Cdc6, Ezh2 and Melk loci, thereby providing a direct link between MOZ, H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, and normal transcriptional levels at these loci. This work establishes that MOZ is an upstream inhibitor of the INK4A-ARF pathway, and suggests that inhibiting MOZ may be one way to induce senescence in proliferative tumour cells.","['Sheikh, B N', 'Phipson, B', 'El-Saafin, F', 'Vanyai, H K', 'Downer, N L', 'Bird, M J', 'Kueh, A J', 'May, R E', 'Smyth, G K', 'Voss, A K', 'Thomas, T']","['Sheikh BN', 'Phipson B', 'El-Saafin F', 'Vanyai HK', 'Downer NL', 'Bird MJ', 'Kueh AJ', 'May RE', 'Smyth GK', 'Voss AK', 'Thomas T']","['Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Development and Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (MOZ protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*physiology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Signal Transduction']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201533 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.33 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Nov 19;34(47):5807-20. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.33.

However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive. We performed mutational analysis to define a PML interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. Our results showed that E1B-55K/PML binding is not required for p53, Mre11 and Daxx interaction. We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities.","['Wimmer, P', 'Berscheminski, J', 'Blanchette, P', 'Groitl, P', 'Branton, P E', 'Hay, R T', 'Dobner, T', 'Schreiner, S']","['Wimmer P', 'Berscheminski J', 'Blanchette P', 'Groitl P', 'Branton PE', 'Hay RT', 'Dobner T', 'Schreiner S']","['Department of Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Goodman Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.', 'Department of Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201563 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Jan 7;35(1):69-82. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.63.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to estimate the incidences of rare skin malignancies in patients with CLL/SLL or NHL. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of CLL/SLL or NHL recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database during 1992-2007 were identified. Diagnoses of specific skin malignancies were identified from SEER files. RESULTS: During 1992-2007, a total of 128,674 patients with first diagnoses of CLL/SLL or NHL were recorded in SEER; 4743 were excluded because follow-up data were unavailable. Among the remaining 123,931 patients, 28,964 had CLL/SLL and 94,967 had NHL. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for invasive malignant melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Kaposi's sarcoma, and sebaceous carcinoma were 2.3, 8.2, 3.6, 2.5, 2.9, and 1.4, respectively, in CLL/SLL patients and 1.6, 3.2, 1.5, 1.3, 17.6, and 0.8, respectively, in NHL patients. When invasive melanoma was stratified by patient age and sex, the highest SIR (17.8) was found in men aged 0-49 years with CLL (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLL/SLL or NHL have a higher risk for the subsequent development of rare skin cancers. Given the more aggressive nature of these malignancies in this setting, regular monitoring for the development and prompt treatment of cutaneous malignancy is prudent in patients with NHL and particularly in patients with CLL. Regular use of sun protection may decrease the morbidity associated with skin cancer in this immunosuppressed population.","['Brewer, Jerry D', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Roenigk, Randall K', 'Weaver, Amy L', 'Otley, Clark C']","['Brewer JD', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Call TG', 'Cerhan JR', 'Roenigk RK', 'Weaver AL', 'Otley CC']","['Division of Dermatologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Dermatologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Dermatologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150313,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Sebaceous/*epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatofibrosarcoma/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'SEER Program', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*epidemiology', 'Sebaceous Gland Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/17 06:00,2016/04/27 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijd.12564 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2015 Aug;54(8):e287-93. doi: 10.1111/ijd.12564.

Other risk factors for PGF included recipient age <30, HLA mismatch, male recipients of female donor grafts, ABO incompatibility, busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning and cryopreservation. In bone marrow transplants, total nucleated cell doses 2.4 x 10(8) per kg were associated with PGF (odds ratio 1.39; P<0.001). The use of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were associated with decreased PGF risk. These data, allow clinicians to do more informed choices with respect to graft source, donor selection, conditioning and immunosuppressive regimens to reduce the risk of PGF. Moreover, a novel risk score determined on day 21 post transplant may provide the rationale for an early request for additional hematopoietic stem cells.","['Olsson, R F', 'Logan, B R', 'Chaudhury, S', 'Zhu, X', 'Akpek, G', 'Bolwell, B J', 'Bredeson, C N', 'Dvorak, C C', 'Gupta, V', 'Ho, V T', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Marks, D I', 'Ringden, O T H', 'Pasquini, M C', 'Schriber, J R', 'Cooke, K R']","['Olsson RF', 'Logan BR', 'Chaudhury S', 'Zhu X', 'Akpek G', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Bredeson CN', 'Dvorak CC', 'Gupta V', 'Ho VT', 'Lazarus HM', 'Marks DI', 'Ringden OT', 'Pasquini MC', 'Schriber JR', 'Cooke KR']","['1] Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden [2] Centre for Clinical Research Sormland, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', '1] CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA [2] Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Department of Pediatrics, Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."", 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center, Gilbert, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'The Ottawa Hospital Blood and Marrow Transplant Program and the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.', '1] Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden [2] Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', '1] Cancer Transplant Institute, Virginia G Piper Cancer Center, Scottsdale, AZ, USA [2] Arizona Oncology, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20150316,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*etiology/mortality', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Primary Graft Dysfunction/drug therapy/*etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC4527886,2015/03/17 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201575 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.75 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1754-62. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.75.

No superior second-line therapy has been established for steroid-refractory disease. Imatinib mesylate is a multikinase inhibitor of several signaling pathways implicated in skin fibrosis with in vitro antifibrotic activity. We performed an open-label pilot phase II trial of imatinib in children and adults with corticosteroid-refractory ScGVHD. Twenty patients were enrolled in a 6-month trial. Eight received a standard dose (adult, 400 mg daily; children, 260 mg/m(2) daily). Because of poor tolerability, 12 additional patients underwent a dose escalation regimen (adult, 100 mg daily initial dose up to 200 mg daily maximum; children, initial dose 65 mg/m(2) daily up to 130 mg/m(2) daily). Fourteen patients were assessable for primary response, improvement in joint ROM deficit, at 6 months. Primary outcome criteria for partial response was met in 5 of 14 (36%), stable disease in 7 of 14 (50%), and progressive disease in 2 of 14 (14%) patients. Eleven patients (79%), including 5 with partial response and 6 with stable disease, demonstrated a positive gain in ROM (range of 3% to 94% improvement in deficit).

Many sunscreens and cosmetics now use zinc oxide (ZnO) or titania (TiO2) NPs, which are effective ultraviolet (UV) filters. Zinc oxide topical creams are also used in mild anti-inflammatory treatments. In this study we evaluated the effect of size and dispersion state of ZnO and TiO2 NPs, compared to ""bulk"" ZnO, on mast cell degranulation and viability. ZnO and TiO2 NPs were characterized using dynamic light scattering and disc centrifugation. Rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells and primary mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were exposed to ZnO and TiO2 NPs of different sizes (25-200 nm) and surface coatings at concentrations from 1 to 200 mug/mL. The effect of NPs on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent mast cell degranulation was assessed by measuring release of both beta-hexosaminidase and histamine via colorimetric and ELISA assays. The intracellular level of Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions were measured using zinquin ethyl ester and Fluo-4 AM fluorescence probes, respectively. Cellular viability was determined using the soluble tetrazolium-based MTS colorimetric assay. Exposure of RBL-2H3 and primary mouse BMMC to ZnO NPs markedly inhibited both histamine and beta-hexosaminidase release. This effect was both particle size and dispersion dependent. In contrast, TiO2 NPs did not inhibit the allergic response. These effects were independent of cytotoxicity, which was observed only at high concentrations of ZnO NPs, and was not observed for TiO2 NPs. The inhibitory effects of ZnO NPs on mast cells were inversely proportional to particle size and dispersion status, and thus these NPs may have greater potential than ""bulk"" zinc in the inhibition of allergic responses.","['Feltis, B N', 'Elbaz, A', 'Wright, P F A', 'Mackay, G A', 'Turney, T W', 'Lopata, A L']","['Feltis BN', 'Elbaz A', 'Wright PF', 'Mackay GA', 'Turney TW', 'Lopata AL']","['School of Medical Sciences, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Materials Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

Another natural source of this compound is a shrub Sophora flavescens, used in traditional Chinese medicine. Main dietary source of IXN is beer, and the compound is produced from XN during wort boiling. In the human body, the compound is O-demethylated to 8PN, the strongest known phytoestrogen. This process takes place in the liver and in the intestine, where it is mediated by local microflora. It has been reported in some studies that even though beer contains small amounts of hops and its preparations, these compounds may affect the functioning of the human body. IXN exhibits an antiproliferative activity against human cell lines typical for breast cancer (MCF-7), ovarian cancer (A-2780), prostate cancer (DU145 and PC-3), and colon cancer (HT-29 and SW620) cells. It strongly inhibits the activation of the following carcinogens: 2-amino-3-methylimidazol-[4,5-f]quinoline and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) via human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2). It also inhibits the production of prostate specific antigen (PSA). IXN significantly reduces the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the case of invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231. It interferes with JAK/STAT signaling pathway and inhibits the expression of pro1inflammatory genes in the monoblastic leukemia cell line (MonoMac6). It activates apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). In addition, IXN shows an antiviral activity towards herpes viruses (HSV1 and HSV2) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV).","['Zolnierczyk, Anna Katarzyna', 'Maczka, Wanda Krystyna', 'Grabarczyk, Malgorzata', 'Winska, Katarzyna', 'Wozniak, Edyta', 'Aniol, Miroslaw']","['Zolnierczyk AK', 'Maczka WK', 'Grabarczyk M', 'Winska K', 'Wozniak E', 'Aniol M']","['Department of Chemistry, The Faculty of Food Science, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, 50-375 Wroclaw, C.

We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary efficacy of DT2219 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DT2219 was administered intravenously over 2 hours every other day for 4 total doses. Dose was escalated from 0.5 mug/kg/day to 80 mug/kg/day in nine dose cohorts until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with mature or precursor B-cell lymphoid malignancies expressing CD19 and/or CD22 enrolled to the study. Patients received median 3 prior lines of chemotherapy and 8 failed hematopoietic transplantation. All patients received a single course of DT2219; one patient was retreated. The most common adverse events, including weight gain, low albumin, transaminitis, and fever were transient grade 1-2 and occurred in patients in higher dose cohorts (>/=40 mug/kg/day). Two subjects experienced DLT at dose levels 40 and 60 mug/kg. Durable objective responses occurred in 2 patients; one was complete remission after 2 cycles. Correlative studies showed a surprisingly low incidence of neutralizing antibody (30%). CONCLUSIONS: We have determined the safety of a novel immunotoxin DT2219 and established its biologically active dose between 40 and 80 mug/kg/day x4. A phase II study exploring repetitive courses of DT2219 is planned.","['Bachanova, Veronika', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Cao, Qing', 'Lewis, Dixie', 'Grzywacz, Bartosz', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Lazaryan, Aleksandr', 'McClune, Brian', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Vallera, Daniel A']","['Bachanova V', 'Frankel AE', 'Cao Q', 'Lewis D', 'Grzywacz B', 'Verneris MR', 'Ustun C', 'Lazaryan A', 'McClune B', 'Warlick ED', 'Kantarjian H', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Miller JS', 'Vallera DA']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, Texas.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. valle001@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (DT 2219 immunotoxin)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Diphtheria Toxin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC4360883,2015/03/15 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/03/15 06:00'],"['2015/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['21/6/1267 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2877 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Mar 15;21(6):1267-72. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2877.,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,"['P30 CA77598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR000113/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 RR033182/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS662476'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This off-target activity makes tamoxifen an interesting ancillary for boosting the apoptosis-inducing properties of ceramide, a sphingolipid with valuable tumor censoring activity. Here we show for the first time that tamoxifen and metabolite, N-desmethyltamoxifen (DMT), block ceramide glycosylation and inhibit ceramide hydrolysis (by acid ceramidase, AC) in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and in AML cells derived from patients. Tamoxifen (1-10 muM) inhibition of AC in AML cells was accompanied by decreases in AC protein expression. Tamoxifen also depressed expression and activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme-catalyzing production of mitogenic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1-P). Results from mass spectroscopy showed that tamoxifen and DMT (i) increased the levels of endogenous C16:0 and C24:1 ceramide molecular species, (ii) nearly totally halted production of respective glucosylceramide (GC) molecular species, (iii) drastically reduced levels of sphingosine (to 9% of control), and (iv) reduced levels of S1-P by 85%, in vincristine-resistant HL-60/VCR cells. The co-administration of tamoxifen with either N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), a ceramide-generating retinoid, or a cell-deliverable form of ceramide, C6-ceramide, resulted in marked decreases in HL-60/VCR cell viability that far exceeded single agent potency. Combination treatments resulted in synergistic apoptotic cell death as gauged by increased Annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3. These results show the versatility of adjuvant triphenylethylene with ceramide-centric therapies for magnifying therapeutic potential in AML. Such drug regimens could serve as effective strategies, even in the multidrug-resistant setting.","['Morad, Samy A F', 'Tan, Su-Fern', 'Feith, David J', 'Kester, Mark', 'Claxton, David F', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Barth, Brian M', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Morad SA', 'Tan SF', 'Feith DJ', 'Kester M', 'Claxton DF', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Barth BM', 'Fox TE', 'Cabot MC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA; University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA; University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0001, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.

Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to account for this poor prognosis and relapse. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a critical regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway and has been shown to be frequently activated in leukemia. However, the role of PDK1 in the regulation of LSCs in AML is still not clear. Using a PDK1 conditional deletion MLL-AF9 murine AML model, we revealed that the deletion of PDK1 prolonged the survival of AML mice by inducing LSC apoptosis. This was accompanied by the increased expression of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and p53 and the reduced expression of Stat5, which has been shown to be constitutively activated in leukemia. Thus, our findings suggest that PDK1 plays an essential role in maintaining LSCs. Further delineating the function of PDK1 in LSCs may provide a new strategy for the improved treatment of AML relapse.","['Hu, Tianyuan', 'Li, Cong', 'Zhang, Yingchi', 'Wang, Le', 'Peng, Luyun', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Wang, Weili', 'Chu, Yajing', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Yuan, Weiping']","['Hu T', 'Li C', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang L', 'Peng L', 'Cheng H', 'Wang W', 'Chu Y', 'Xu M', 'Cheng T', 'Yuan W']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

Transplants were grouped according to presence vs absence of KIR-ligand mismatches in the graft-vs-host direction (ie, of donor-vs-recipient natural killer [NK]-cell alloreactivity). In the absence of donor-vs-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity, donor activating KIRs had no effects on outcomes. In the 69 transplant pairs with donor-vs-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity, transplantation from donors with KIR2DS1 and/or KIR3DS1 was associated with reduced risk of nonrelapse mortality, largely infection related (KIR2DS1 present vs absent: hazard ratio [HR], 0.25; P = .01; KIR3DS1 present vs absent: HR, 0.18; P = .006), and better event-free survival (KIR2DS1 present vs absent: HR, 0.31; P = .011; KIR3DS1 present vs absent: HR, 0.30; P = .008). Transplantation from donors with KIR2DS1 and/or KIR3DS1 was also associated with a 50% reduction in infection rate (P = .003). In vitro analyses showed that KIR2DS1 binding to its HLA-C2 ligand upregulated inflammatory cytokine production by alloreactive NK cells in response to infectious challenges. Because approximately 40% of donors able to exert donor-vs-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity carry KIR2DS1 and/or KIR3DS1, searching for them may become a feasible, additional criterion in donor selection.","['Mancusi, Antonella', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Urbani, Elena', 'Pierini, Antonio', 'Massei, Maria Speranza', 'Carotti, Alessandra', 'Terenzi, Adelmo', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Tosti, Antonella', 'Topini, Fabiana', 'Bozza, Silvia', 'Romani, Luigina', 'Tognellini, Rita', 'Stern, Martin', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Mancusi A', 'Ruggeri L', 'Urbani E', 'Pierini A', 'Massei MS', 'Carotti A', 'Terenzi A', 'Falzetti F', 'Tosti A', 'Topini F', 'Bozza S', 'Romani L', 'Tognellini R', 'Stern M', 'Aversa F', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Microbiology, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Microbiology, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Blood Bank, Ospedale Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Immunotherapy Laboratory, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C*02 antigen)', '0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Genetic Loci', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA-C Antigens/immunology/metabolism', '*Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2015/03/15 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31695-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-599993 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 14;125(20):3173-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-599993.

The ORR for G-FC was 62% (13/21), with 10% CR and 14% CRi, including 4 patients not evaluable. With a median follow-up of 23.5 months in the G-B cohort and 20.7 months in the G-FC cohort, no patient has relapsed or died. We conclude that obinutuzumab with either B or FC shows manageable toxicity and has promising activity.

METHODS: We analyzed the absolute lymphocyte count at 20 (D+20) and 30 (D+30) days after HSCT in 100 patients with malignant hematologic diseases and correlated with the risk of transplant-related mortality, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapsed mortality (NRM), and risk of infection. RESULTS: Patients presenting with lymphocyte counts of <300 x 103/muL on D+30 have a 3.76 times greater risk of death in <100 days. Over a medium follow-up of 20 months OS, DFS, and NRM were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: In our group of patients delayed lymphocyte recovery after HSCT was a predictor of early death post-HSCT.","['Rigoni, L', 'Scroferneker, M L', 'Pitombeira, B S', 'Ottoni, E', 'Paz, A', 'Fischer, G', 'Michalowski, M', 'Pezzi, A', 'Amorin, B', 'Valim, V', 'Baggio, L', 'Laureano, A', 'da Silva, M A', 'Silla, L', 'Daudt, L']","['Rigoni L', 'Scroferneker ML', 'Pitombeira BS', 'Ottoni E', 'Paz A', 'Fischer G', 'Michalowski M', 'Pezzi A', 'Amorin B', 'Valim V', 'Baggio L', 'Laureano A', 'da Silva MA', 'Silla L', 'Daudt L']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Hospital Santo Antonio, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Laboratory of Cell Culture and Molecular Analysis of Hematopoietic Cells, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

This study addresses this issue in 228 adult patients above 50 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission given peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-identical siblings after fludarabine and 2 days of intravenous busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning. A total of 152 patients received anti-thymocyte globulin, either in combination with cyclosporine A in 86 patients (group 1), or with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil or short course methotrexate in 66 patients (group 2). The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil (group 3). Incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease were comparable in the three groups (16.5%, 29.5% and 19.5% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, P=0.15). In multivariate analysis, the absence of anti-thymocyte globulin was the only factor associated with a higher risk of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (P=0.005), while the use of triple immunosuppression (group 3) was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P=0.003). In comparison to anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone, the other two strategies of graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis were associated with reduced leukemia-free survival and overall survival (P=0.001 for each parameter), independently of the dose of anti-thymocyte globulin. These data suggest that fine tuning of the intensity of this prophylaxis can affect the outcome of transplantation and that anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone should be the preferred combination with the fludarabine-busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and sibling donors.","['Rubio, Marie Therese', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Contreras, Rafael Rojas', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Vigouroux, Stephane', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Bulabois, Claude-Eric', 'Caminos, Nerea', 'Lopez-Corral, Lucia', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Rubio MT', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Socie G', 'Contreras RR', 'Chevallier P', 'Sanz MA', 'Vigouroux S', 'Huynh A', 'Shimoni A', 'Bulabois CE', 'Caminos N', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","[""Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France INSERM UMRs938, CDR Saint Antoine, Paris, France mt_rubio@hotmail.com."", ""Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France EBMT Data Office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hopital St. Louis, Dept. of Hematology - BMT, Paris, France.', 'IMIBIC/Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.', ""CHU Nantes, Dept.

In this study, telomere length was also negatively correlated with the age of patients (r(2)=0.528; P=0.000) which supports the notion that it could be used as a marker for biological aging. ALT associated PML bodies containing PML protein was found in telomerase negative cases of RCC. It suggests the presence of an ALT pathway mechanism to maintain the telomere length in telomerase negative RCC tissues which was associated with high stages of RCC, suggesting a prevalent mechanism for telomere maintenance in high stages. In conclusion, the telomerase activity and telomere length can be used as a diagnostic as well as a predictive marker in RCC. The prevalence of ALT mechanism in high stages of RCC is warranted for the development of anti-ALT inhibitors along with telomerase inhibitor against RCC as a therapeutic approach.","['Pal, Deeksha', 'Sharma, Ujjawal', 'Khajuria, Ragini', 'Singh, Shrawan Kumar', 'Kakkar, Nandita', 'Prasad, Rajendra']","['Pal D', 'Sharma U', 'Khajuria R', 'Singh SK', 'Kakkar N', 'Prasad R']","['Department of Biochemistry, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Urology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Histopathology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.

Melphalan is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent against multiple myeloma. However, despite a 70-80% initial response rate, virtually all patients eventually relapse due to the emergence of drug-resistant tumour cells. By using global proteomic and transcriptomic profiling on melphalan sensitive and resistant RPMI8226 cell lines followed by functional assays, we discovered changes in cellular processes and pathways not previously associated with melphalan resistance in multiple myeloma cells, including a metabolic switch conforming to the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis), and an elevated oxidative stress response mediated by VEGF/IL8-signaling. In addition, up-regulated aldo-keto reductase levels of the AKR1C family involved in prostaglandin synthesis contribute to the resistant phenotype. Finally, selected metabolic and oxidative stress response enzymes were targeted by inhibitors, several of which displayed a selective cytotoxicity against the melphalan-resistant cells and should be further explored to elucidate their potential to overcome melphalan resistance.","['Zub, Kamila Anna', 'Sousa, Mirta Mittelstedt Leal de', 'Sarno, Antonio', 'Sharma, Animesh', 'Demirovic, Aida', 'Rao, Shalini', 'Young, Clifford', 'Aas, Per Arne', 'Ericsson, Ida', 'Sundan, Anders', 'Jensen, Ole Norregaard', 'Slupphaug, Geir']","['Zub KA', 'Sousa MM', 'Sarno A', 'Sharma A', 'Demirovic A', 'Rao S', 'Young C', 'Aas PA', 'Ericsson I', 'Sundan A', 'Jensen ON', 'Slupphaug G']","['Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway; PROMEC Core Facility for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway; PROMEC Core Facility for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*genetics', 'Proteome/drug effects/genetics', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transcriptome/drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics']",PMC4358942,2015/03/15 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119857 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-42749 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 13;10(3):e0119857. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119857. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using transcriptome sequencing data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, breast cancer and uveal melanoma tumor samples, we show that hundreds of cryptic 3' splice sites (3'SSs) are used in cancers with SF3B1 mutations. We define the necessary sequence context for the observed cryptic 3' SSs and propose that cryptic 3'SS selection is a result of SF3B1 mutations causing a shift in the sterically protected region downstream of the branch point. While most cryptic 3'SSs are present at low frequency (<10%) relative to nearby canonical 3'SSs, we identified ten genes that preferred out-of-frame cryptic 3'SSs. We show that cancers with mutations in the SF3B1 HEAT 5-9 repeats use cryptic 3'SSs downstream of the branch point and provide both a mechanistic model consistent with published experimental data and affected targets that will guide further research into the oncogenic effects of SF3B1 mutation.","['DeBoever, Christopher', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Shepard, Peter J', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Barrett, Christian L', 'Jepsen, Kristen', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Carson, Dennis', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Frazer, Kelly A']","['DeBoever C', 'Ghia EM', 'Shepard PJ', 'Rassenti L', 'Barrett CL', 'Jepsen K', 'Jamieson CH', 'Carson D', 'Kipps TJ', 'Frazer KA']","['Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', ""Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America."", 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', ""Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America."", 'Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', ""Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splice Sites/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",PMC4358997,2015/03/15 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004105 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-14-01585 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2015 Mar 13;11(3):e1004105. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004105. eCollection 2015 Mar.,,,,"['1R21CA152613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA121938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA152613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has led to a reduction in mortality rates, and the estimated prevalence of CML is increasing accordingly. Most patients with CML are diagnosed in the chronic phase, and approximately 15% to 30% of these patients will meet some definition of resistance to imatinib. In the more advanced phases of disease, the rates of imatinib resistance are much higher. Both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines emphasize adequate monitoring of patients to ensure that they are meeting treatment milestones. Loss of response is most commonly associated with the acquisition of resistance-conferring kinase domain point mutations within BCR-ABL1. The multiple treatment options available for patients with imatinib-resistant CML include dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib, as well as the non-TKI salvage agent omacetaxine mepesuccinate.

R72P associations with specific cancer risk, particularly hematological malignancies, have been conflicting. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with chromosome 5q deletion is characterized by erythroid hypoplasia arising from lineage-specific p53 accumulation resulting from ribosomal insufficiency. We hypothesized that apoptotically diminished R72P C-allele may influence predisposition to del(5q) MDS. Bone marrow and blood DNA was sequenced from 705 MDS cases (333 del(5q), 372 non-del(5q)) and 157 controls. Genotype distribution did not significantly differ between del(5q) cases (12.6% CC, 38.1% CG, 49.2% GG), non-del(5q) cases (9.7% CC, 44.6% CG, 45.7% GG) and controls (7.6% CC, 37.6% CG, 54.8% GG) (P=0.13). Allele frequency did not differ between non-del(5q) and del(5q) cases (P=0.91) but trended towards increased C-allele frequency comparing non-del(5q) (P=0.08) and del(5q) (P=0.10) cases with controls. Median lenalidomide response duration increased proportionate to C-allele dosage in del(5q) patients (2.2 (CC), 1.3 (CG) and 0.89 years (GG)). Furthermore, C-allele homozygosity in del(5q) was associated with prolonged overall and progression-free survival and non-terminal interstitial deletions that excluded 5q34, whereas G-allele homozygozity was associated with inferior outcome and terminal deletions involving 5q34 (P=0.05). These findings comprise the largest MDS R72P SNP analysis.","['McGraw, K L', 'Zhang, L M', 'Rollison, D E', 'Basiorka, A A', 'Fulp, W', 'Rawal, B', 'Jerez, A', 'Billingsley, D L', 'Lin, H-Y', 'Kurtin, S E', 'Yoder, S', 'Zhang, Y', 'Guinta, K', 'Mallo, M', 'Sole, F', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Cervera, J', 'Such, E', 'Gonzalez, T', 'Nevill, T J', 'Haferlach, T', 'Smith, A E', 'Kulasekararaj, A', 'Mufti, G', 'Karsan, A', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'Sokol, L', 'Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Wei, S', 'List, A F']","['McGraw KL', 'Zhang LM', 'Rollison DE', 'Basiorka AA', 'Fulp W', 'Rawal B', 'Jerez A', 'Billingsley DL', 'Lin HY', 'Kurtin SE', 'Yoder S', 'Zhang Y', 'Guinta K', 'Mallo M', 'Sole F', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Cervera J', 'Such E', 'Gonzalez T', 'Nevill TJ', 'Haferlach T', 'Smith AE', 'Kulasekararaj A', 'Mufti G', 'Karsan A', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Sokol L', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Wei S', 'List AF']","['Hematology Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Molecular Genomics Core Lab, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Cancer Epidemiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', '1] Hematology Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA [2] Cancer Biology PhD Program, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Biostatistics-Division of Health Sciences Research, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Molecular Genomics Core Lab, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Institut de Recerca Contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras (IJC) Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Recerca Contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras (IJC) Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics Medicine Public Foundation, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', ""King's College London, King's College Hospital, London, UK."", ""King's College London, King's College Hospital, London, UK."", ""King's College London, King's College Hospital, London, UK."", 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Hematology Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Immunology Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Immunology Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Hematology Department, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC4382654,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201511 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.11 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Mar 13;5:e291. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.11.,,,,"['R01 CA131076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA174664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA115308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 R01 CA131076-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant improvements in survival outcomes have been realized over the last decade for all age groups with de novo ALL. Frontline treatment incorporates a tailored approach, based on factors such as the patient's age and the disease subtype. Children, adolescents, and young adults are likely to receive intensifying or deintensifying chemotherapy regimens using standard chemotherapeutics (eg, anthracyclines, vincristine, asparaginase) based on risk stratification. Older adults appear to benefit from reduced-intensity chemotherapy regimens, which incorporate targeted therapy (eg, monoclonal antibodies). New data suggest that a more intensive pediatric protocol might be feasible in adult patients. More than half of ALL patients relapse, and their limited survival has led to the development of novel approaches. Recently approved chemotherapeutic agents include clofarabine, nelarabine, asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi, and vincristine sulfate liposome injection, a novel formulation that permits administration of a higher dosage of vincristine than that used in standard regimens. Approaches under investigation include cell therapy using autologous T-cell technologies, antibody-drug conjugates, and agents targeting common gene mutations.

Most cases are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. Adults have a worse prognosis than children. Approximately half of adult ALL patients relapse after their initial treatment. There is no standard treatment for ALL; strategies vary according to the patient's age, comorbidities, and Philadelphia chromosome status. Regimens used in pediatric patients are being adapted for use in adults. Frontline management can include hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with cycles of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD) and the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster regimen. Relapsed/refractory patients have several options, including a regimen consisting of fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG); tyrosine kinase inhibitors; and chemotherapy. The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved 3 therapies for these patients: clofarabine, nelarabine, and vincristine sulfate liposome injection, a modified formulation of vincristine that allows the drug to be administered at a higher dosage. Several novel strategies are currently under investigation, including the monoclonal antibody blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager that targets the B-cell-specific antigen CD19 and activates T cells to exert cytotoxic activity against the target B cell.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was negative for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and John Cunningham virus (JCV) DNA. The clinical suggestion of PML prompted us to perform a brain biopsy and to start treatment with mefloquine. In the brain biopsy, histopathological features of demyelination were described and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified JCV, confirming the diagnosis of PML. Treatment with mefloquine (250 mg/week) and dexamethasone (4 mg/day) was started and maintained for 6 months. A year later there was an almost complete resolution of the MRI lesions and the patient achieved a stable clinical state with persisting motor impairment and severe epilepsy.

We report a successful endovascular technique using a snare for retrieving broken peripherally inserted venous ports in a child for chemotherapy. Catheter fragments may cause complications such as cardiac perforation, arrhythmias, sepsis, and pulmonary embolism. A 12-year-old female received chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia through a central venous port implanted into her right subclavian area. The patient completed chemotherapy without complications 6 months ago. Venous port was accidentally fractured during its removal. Chest radiographs of the patient revealed intracardiac catheter fragment extending from the right subclavian to the right atrium (RA) and looping in the RA. The procedure was performed under ketamine and midazolam anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance using a percutaneous femoral vein approach. A snare with triple loops (10 mm in diameter) was used to successfully retrieve the catheter fragments without any complication. Percutaneous transcatheter retrieval of catheter fragments is occasionally extremely useful and should be considered by interventional cardiologists for retrieving migrated catheters and can be chosen before resorting to surgery, which has potential risks related to thoracotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and general anesthesia.","['Ghaderian, Mehdi', 'Sabri, Mohammad Reza', 'Ahmadi, Ali Reza']","['Ghaderian M', 'Sabri MR', 'Ahmadi AR']","['Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Child Growth and Development Research Center, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Child Growth and Development Research Center, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Child Growth and Development Research Center, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,India,J Res Med Sci,Journal of research in medical sciences : the official journal of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,101235599,,,,PMC4354073,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/03/15 06:01,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/15 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Res Med Sci. 2015 Jan;20(1):97-9.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Percutaneous retrieval', 'port catheter', 'triple loops snare']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the antitumor activity of zerumbone (ZER) has been reported, there has been no information available on the effect of ZER-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) (ZER-NLC) on murine leukemia cells. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo effects of ZER-NLC on murine leukemia induced with WEHI-3B cells were investigated. The results from 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Hoechst 33342, Annexin V, cell cycle, and caspase activity assays showed that the growth of leukemia cells in vitro was inhibited by ZER-NLC. In addition, outcomes of histopathology, transmission electron microscopy, and Tdt-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling analyses revealed that the number of leukemia cells in the spleen of BALB/c leukemia mice significantly decreased after 4 weeks of oral treatment with various doses of ZER-NLC. Western blotting and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays confirmed the antileukemia effects of ZER-NLC. In conclusion, ZER-NLC was shown to induce a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in murine leukemia. Loading of ZER in NLC did not compromise the anticancer effect of the compound, suggesting ZER-NLC as a promising and effective delivery system for treatment of cancers.","['Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman', 'Rasedee, Abdullah', 'How, Chee Wun', 'Zeenathul, Nazariah Allaudin', 'Chartrand, Max Stanley', 'Yeap, Swee Keong', 'Abdul, Ahmad Bustamam', 'Tan, Sheau Wei', 'Othman, Hemn Hassan', 'Ajdari, Zahra', 'Namvar, Farideh', 'Arulselvan, Palanisamy', 'Fakurazi, Sharida', 'Mehrbod, Parvaneh', 'Daneshvar, Nasibeh', 'Begum, Hasina']","['Rahman HS', 'Rasedee A', 'How CW', 'Zeenathul NA', 'Chartrand MS', 'Yeap SK', 'Abdul AB', 'Tan SW', 'Othman HH', 'Ajdari Z', 'Namvar F', 'Arulselvan P', 'Fakurazi S', 'Mehrbod P', 'Daneshvar N', 'Begum H']","['Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimany, Sulaimany City, Northern Iraq.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'DigiCare Behavioral Research, Casa Grande, AZ, USA.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimany, Sulaimany City, Northern Iraq.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products (INTROP), Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '471-05-6 (zerumbone)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', '*Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC4354694,2015/03/15 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S67113 [doi]', 'ijn-10-1649 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2015 Mar 2;10:1649-66. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S67113. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BALB/c mice', 'WEHI-3B cells', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia', 'mitochondrial pathway', 'zerumbone-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An elderly woman with AML with an inv(2)(p23q13)/RANBP2-ALK and monosomy 7 was treated with crizotinib. After a short-term hematological response and the restoration of normal hematopoiesis, she experienced a relapse of AML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the ALK break-apart probe confirmed the inv(2)(p23q13), while G-banded karyotyping revealed the deletion of a segment of the short arm of chromosome 1 [del(1)(p13p22)] after crizotinib therapy. The ALK gene carried a heterozygous mutation at the nucleotide position g.716751G>C within exon 25, causing the p.G1269A amino acid substitution within the ALK-KD. Reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that the mutated ALK allele was selectively transcribed and the mutation occurred in the ALK allele rearranged with RANBP2. As both the del(1)(p13p22) at the cytogenetic level and p.G1269A at the nucleotide level newly appeared after crizotinib treatment, it is likely that they were secondarily acquired alterations involved in crizotinib resistance. Although secondary genetic abnormalities in ALK are most frequently described in non-small cell lung cancers harboring an ALK alteration, this report suggests that an ALK-KD mutation can occur independently of the tumor cell type or fusion partner after crizotinib treatment.","['Takeoka, Kayo', 'Okumura, Atsuko', 'Maesako, Yoshitomo', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Ohno, Hitoshi']","['Takeoka K', 'Okumura A', 'Maesako Y', 'Akasaka T', 'Ohno H']","['Tenri Institute of Medical Research, Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan.', 'Tenri Institute of Medical Research, Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan.', 'Tenri Institute of Medical Research, Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan; Department of Hematology, Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan.

Imiquimod (IMQ) directly exhibits anti-tumor activity through the induction of apoptosis and autophagic cell death. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of AMPK in IMQ-induced apoptosis and autophagy. METHODS: The phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrates was detected by immunoblotting. ATP contents were analyzed by an ATP bioluminescence assay. The upstream signaling for AMPK activation was dissected by examination of TLR7/8 expression, over-expression of TLR7/8, the addition of AMPK kinase inhibitors, and the genetic silencing of Myd88 and LKB1. The role of AMPK activation in IMQ-induced autophagy and apoptosis was assessed by inhibiting AMPK, genetically silencing AMPK and over-expressing AMPK dominant-negative mutants. Autophagy and apoptosis were evaluated by a DNA content assay, immunoblotting, EGFP-LC3 puncta detection and acridine orange staining. RESULTS: IMQ could activate AMPK and autophagy in cancer cells not expressing TLR7/8. IMQ caused ATP depletion and induced LKB1-mediated AMPK activation. The down-regulation of AMPK activity via pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing resulted in reduced IMQ-induced apoptosis but did not influence autophagy, and this rescue effect was associated with the retention of translation factor activity and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 protein expression levels. CONCLUSION: IMQ induces AMPK activation independent of TLR7/8 expression, resulting in translation inhibition and subsequent apoptosis through ATP depletion and LKB1 signaling, in skin tumor cells.","['Wang, Sin-Ting', 'Huang, Shi-Wei', 'Kao, Jun-Kai', 'Liang, Shu-Mei', 'Chen, Yi-Ju', 'Chen, Yu-Yu', 'Wu, Chun-Ying', 'Shieh, Jeng-Jer']","['Wang ST', 'Huang SW', 'Kao JK', 'Liang SM', 'Chen YJ', 'Chen YY', 'Wu CY', 'Shieh JJ']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan."", 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.

In this study, we present results of the ENESTchina (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-China) that was conducted to investigate nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs imatinib 400 mg once daily in a Chinese population. ENESTchina met its primary end point with a statistically significant higher rate of major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1 </=0.1% on the International Scale) at 12 months in the nilotinib arm vs the imatinib arm (52.2% vs 27.8%; P < .0001), and MMR rates remained higher with nilotinib vs imatinib throughout the follow-up period. Rates of complete cytogenetic response (0% Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] metaphases by standard cytogenetics) were comparable and >/=80% by 24 months in both arms. The estimated rate of freedom from progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis at 24 months was 95.4% in each arm. The safety profiles of both drugs were similar to those from previous studies. In conclusion, rates of MMR at 12 months were superior with nilotinib vs imatinib in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression of ID1 is induced by abnormal tyrosine kinases, such as FLT3 and BCR-ABL. High level expression of ID1 is associated with poor prognosis in young patients. We aimed to explore the ID1 mutation and its prognosis in AML patients. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-three AML patients were included. Cytogenetic results and ID1 mutation were compared. The ID1 gene was amplified by nested PCR, and the mutation was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Four new ID1 mutations (G40C, A124G, A230G, A349G) were identified in the normal karyotype patients. The A349G mutation, located in the nuclear export signal domain of the ID1 protein, was predicted by the in silico method as a damaged protein. Meanwhile, another new mutation, A290G, found in cases with 11q23 deletion, corresponded to the amino acid 97 in the helix 1 position of the ID1 protein. It could interfere with the dimerization of ID1 and EST-1, leading to a disruption of cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found 5 mutations in 260 AML patients. ID1 mutations were not commonly observed in AML. This may differ in other hematologic malignancies. Further studies in other types of hematologic malignancy will help to clarify the importance of ID1 mutations. (c) 2015 S.

The patient was treated again with IM and achieved CMR. A combination of IM and interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) was administered for the following year, and then discontinued. The patient has since sustained CMR without therapy for 24 months, to date. This patient was found to have a BCL2L11 (BIM) deletion polymorphism. CML patients with a BIM deletion polymorphism show a low response to IM, and we infer that the BIM deletion polymorphism is a negative factor for discontinuation of IM.

However, even if these patients achieve and maintain marked molecular responses such as a complete molecular response (BCR-ABL/ABL</=0.032% by international scale), discontinuation of TKI treatment results in early molecular relapse in most cases. Although several factors such as the Sokal score and the duration of TKI treatment have been identified as being related to treatment-free remission (TFR), identification of more definite factors or clinical conditions that would enable us to select patients who can maintain TFR is required. Relapse after TKI discontinuation is considered to be attributable to CML stem cells surviving even in patients who maintain marked molecular responses. A number of in vitro experiments have shown that TKI by itself cannot kill CML stem cells. Also, CML stem cells are resistant to TKI in a manner dependent on self-renewal factors (Hh, Wnt/beta-catenin), cell cycle regulators (PML), metabotropic factors (FOXO3, Alox5), and adhesion molecules (CXCR4). In addition, surface markers specific for CML stem cells such as IL-1RAP and CD26 have been identified. New therapeutic strategies targeting these molecules in combination with TKI hold promise of achieving a more effective strategy for curing CML.","['Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Hirase, Chikara', 'Matsumura, Itaru']","['Tanaka H', 'Hirase C', 'Matsumura I']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism']",,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.56.139 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2015 Feb;56(2):139-49. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.56.139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1) binds to hemimethylated DNA and plays an essential role in the maintenance of DNA methylation. Here, we provide evidence that UHRF1 is transcriptionally downregulated by H3K9 HMTase G9a. We found that increased expression of G9a along with transcription factor YY1 specifically represses UHRF1 transcription during TPA-mediated leukemia cell differentiation. Using ChIP analysis, we found that UHRF1 was among the transcriptionally silenced genes during leukemia cell differentiation. Using a DNA methylation profiling array, we discovered that the UHRF1 promoter was hypomethylated in samples from leukemia patients, further supporting its overexpression and oncogenic activity. Finally, we showed that G9a regulates UHRF1-mediated H3K23 ubiquitination and proper DNA replication maintenance. Therefore, we propose that H3K9 HMTase G9a is a specific epigenetic regulator of UHRF1.","['Kim, Kee-Beom', 'Son, Hye-Ju', 'Choi, Sulji', 'Hahm, Ja Young', 'Jung, Hyeonsoo', 'Baek, Hee Jo', 'Kook, Hoon', 'Hahn, Yoonsoo', 'Kook, Hyun', 'Seo, Sang-Beom']","['Kim KB', 'Son HJ', 'Choi S', 'Hahm JY', 'Jung H', 'Baek HJ', 'Kook H', 'Hahn Y', 'Kook H', 'Seo SB']","['Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun 519-809.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun 519-809.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756.', 'Medical Research Center for Gene Regulation and Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 501-746, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756 sangbs@cau.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150312,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",PMC4402520,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gkv183 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkv183 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Apr 20;43(7):3509-23. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv183.

A second HCT represents one of the few therapeutic options for these high-risk patients. For children undergoing second HCT, the outcome data are particularly limited. We, therefore, conducted a retrospective single-institution study and report the outcomes and prognostic variables associated with overall survival (OS) and relapse in 43 pediatric patients who underwent a second HCT between 2000 and 2013. Eleven of the 43 patients who underwent transplantation remain alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 5 to 127 months). The 5-year probability of OS for the entire cohort was 24%. Patients who had early relapse (<6 months) after first HCT had significantly worse OS than those who relapsed late (>6 months), with 5-year OS at 11% versus 34%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 4.93; P = .013). Active disease at time of second HCT was also associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 2.36; P = .049) for the entire cohort and relapse was the most frequent cause of death (23 of 32; 72%). On subgroup analysis for the 34 patients with leukemia alone, presence of active disease was associated both with a significant decrease in OS (SHR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.09; P = .044) and significant increase in the rate of relapse (SHR, 2.46; P = .046). By contrast, underlying disease, donor source, conditioning regimen, or development of GVHD did not modify OS or rate of relapse. Hence, a second HCT appears to be a useful therapeutic option in children with relapsed hematological malignancies that is most likely to benefit those individuals with late onset of relapse and with low disease burden at the time of transplantation.","['Naik, Swati', 'Martinez, Caridad', 'Leung, Kathryn', 'Sasa, Ghadir', 'Nguyen, Ngoc-Yen', 'Wu, Meng-Fen', 'Gottschalk, Stephen', 'Brenner, Malcolm', 'Heslop, Helen', 'Krance, Robert']","['Naik S', 'Martinez C', 'Leung K', 'Sasa G', 'Nguyen NY', 'Wu MF', 'Gottschalk S', 'Brenner M', 'Heslop H', 'Krance R']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas.

Similarly multifaceted is its contribution to cellular transformation, affecting multiple cellular processes such as self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. Recently, the roles of the DEK and DEK-NUP214 proteins have been elucidated by global analysis of DNA binding and gene expression, as well as multiple functional studies.

It is not known whether this is true in patients treated with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2G TKI) from diagnosis, and whether 2G TKIs modulate the CIP2A pathway. Here, we show that patients with high diagnostic CIP2A levels who receive a 2G TKI do not progress, unlike those treated with imatinib (P=<0.0001). 2G TKIs induce more potent suppression of CIP2A and c-Myc than imatinib. The transcription factor E2F1 is elevated in high CIP2A patients and following 1 month of in vivo treatment 2G TKIs suppress E2F1 and reduce CIP2A; these effects are not seen with imatinib. Silencing of CIP2A, c-Myc or E2F1 in K562 cells or CML CD34+ cells reactivates PP2A leading to BCR-ABL suppression. CIP2A increases proliferation and this is only reduced by 2G TKIs. Patients with high CIP2A levels should be offered 2G TKI treatment in preference to imatinib. 2G TKIs disrupt the CIP2A/c-Myc/E2F1 positive feedback loop, leading to lower disease progression risk. The data supports the view that CIP2A inhibits PP2Ac, stabilising E2F1, creating a CIP2A/c-Myc/E2F1 positive feedback loop, which imatinib cannot overcome.","['Lucas, C M', 'Harris, R J', 'Holcroft, A K', 'Scott, L J', 'Carmell, N', 'McDonald, E', 'Polydoros, F', 'Clark, R E']","['Lucas CM', 'Harris RJ', 'Holcroft AK', 'Scott LJ', 'Carmell N', 'McDonald E', 'Polydoros F', 'Clark RE']","['Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'CR-UK Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150313,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CIP2A protein, human)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoantigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201571 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.71 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1514-23. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.71.

METHODS: The clinical data of 19 cases presenting with bi-ASNHL were retrospectively analyzed, including the clinical features, systemic examinations, laboratory examinations, audiology and radiology results, as well as the prognosis. RESULTS: There were 15 non-otologic diseases in 19 patients, accounting for 78.9% of the total cases, most of which were disorders with multisystem and multi-organ disorder. The central nervous system diseases including fungal meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, and viral encephalitis in 3 patients. The clinical features of deafness were bilateral, progressive, accompanied with fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and change of mental status. There was a decrease in speech recognition score (SRS), and speech recognition threshold (SRT) was obviously inferior to pure tone average (PTA) disproportionally. Diseases of immune system including antineural cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV), relapsing polychondritis (RP), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 5 patients. They showed the characteristics of bilateral, progressive and simultaneous autoimmune disease. Hematological and endocrine system diseases including diabetes mellitus, leukemia, and thyroid hypofunction in 5 patients. The deafness had the characteristics of symmetry and progressivity. Otologic diseases including large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in 4 patients; Drug-induced sensorineural deafness happened in 2 patients. After the treatment aimed at the causes, 1 case was cured, 3 patients were markedly effective, 7 patients were effective, and 8 patients were ineffective(including dead and refusal cases), with a total effective rate of 57.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The most of bi-ASNHL cases are often associated with systemic diseases. Clinicians should analyze the history and clinical characteristics in detail, and complete specific laboratory examinations, audiology and imaging examinations in order to reveal the causative diseases. It should be treated aimed at the etiology.","['Gao, Xiaowei', 'Liu, Liyan', 'Huang, Yongwang', 'Lu, Hongmei', 'Ouyang, Jie', 'Wang, Yanyou']","['Gao X', 'Liu L', 'Huang Y', 'Lu H', 'Ouyang J', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300211, China.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300211, China.

Flow cytometry (FCM) has become an essential tool for immunophenotypic studies of malignant hematopoietic cells. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utilization trend of FCM and its diagnostic yields for hematologic malignancy at a major teaching hospital in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: FCM results of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) specimens during 2000-2013 were analyzed and compared to clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Overall, 7,982 specimens were submitted for diagnostic FCM including 6,561 BM and 1,421 PB. The number of specimens analyzedwas 121, 142, 164, 299, 491, 431, 690, 611, 719, 744, 725, 863, 955 and 1,027, respectively, from 2000 to 2013. The most common clinical diagnoses requested for FCM were acute leukemia (5,911 cases, 74%) followed by lymphoma (1,419 cases, 17.8%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (634 cases, 7.94%). The highest diagnostic yield of FCM was found in acute leukemia cases (69.71%) followed by CLL (35.33%). Only 15.43% of clinically suspected lymphoma cases were positive by FCM. Overutilization of PB (35.6% of cases) instead of BM for lymphoma staging significantly contributed to low diagnostic yields of lymphoma by FCM as circulating tumor cells may not be present in such cases. CONCLUSION: FCM has an increasing role in the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies in Thai patients over the past 14 years with the highest diagnostic yield in acute leukemia. Appropriate specimen types and study indications are required in order to reduce futility of costly diagnostic tests and improve diagnostic yields.","['Promsuwicha, Orathai', 'Kankhao, Supattra', 'Songmuang, Wayuree', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Promsuwicha O', 'Kankhao S', 'Songmuang W', 'Auewarakul CU']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/15 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2015/03/14 06:00'],"['2015/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2014 Dec;97(12):1296-301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the association between Bmi-1 and RKIP and outcome of gastric cancer through clinical data analysis and in vitro experiments. METHODS: Bmi-1 expression and RKIP expression were observed in 107 cases of gastric cancer through use of tissue microarray technology to identify their correlations with clinicopathological parameters, patient survival, and susceptibility to chemotherapy. The correlation was confirmed in gastric cancer cell lines, analyzed further by gene overexpression and silencing analysis, a cell invasion assay, and a chemosensitivity test. RESULTS: Positive expression of Bmi-1 was highly correlated with T classification and clinical stage. Diminished or lost expression of RKIP was significantly associated with T classification, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and clinical stage. Bmi-1 is negatively and RKIP is positively related to patient survival. Positive expression of Bmi-1 and negative expression of RKIP are associated with poor patient survival and modest efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy. A meaningfully inverse association between Bmi-1 and RKIP was found in tissue microarray studies, and was verified further in gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, gene overexpression and silencing analysis indicated that RKIP might be regulated by Bmi-1. Furthermore, the impacts of Bmi-1 on cell invasion and chemotherapy resistance were rescued by knockdown of RKIP. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implies that detection of Bmi-1 and RKIP is valuable in predicting patient survival and therapeutic response in gastric cancer, and the inverse association between Bmi-1 and RKIP reveals the potential molecular mechanisms underlying tumor metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.","['Chen, Yinting', 'Lian, Guoda', 'Ou, Guangsheng', 'Yang, Kege', 'Chen, Jianning', 'Li, Haigang', 'Chen, Shaojie', 'Li, Jiajia', 'Zeng, Linjuan', 'Huang, Kaihong']","['Chen Y', 'Lian G', 'Ou G', 'Yang K', 'Chen J', 'Li H', 'Chen S', 'Li J', 'Zeng L', 'Huang K']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510630, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510630, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, China. zenglinj@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China. huangkh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China. huangkh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,Japan,Gastric Cancer,Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,100886238,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (PEBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacology', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",,2015/03/13 06:00,2016/12/27 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10120-015-0485-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10120-015-0485-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Gastric Cancer. 2016 Apr;19(2):392-402. doi: 10.1007/s10120-015-0485-0.

Ponatinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to overcome single-resistance mutations in the ABL kinase. Three clinical trials confirmed the efficacy of ponatinib in the relapsed and front-line setting in Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, even in the presence of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The rate of relapse appears to be very low when used in combination with chemotherapy, suggesting a role for ponatinib in newly diagnosed patients. A major concern with the use of ponatinib is the associated high risk of life-threatening vascular thrombotic events. Potential strategies to reduce this risk include minimizing the use of ponatinib in patients with significant baseline cardiovascular risk, careful surveillance and treatment of cardiovascular risk-factors and dose reduction of ponatinib.","['Sanford, David S', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Sanford DS', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150312,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced/prevention & control']",,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14737140.2015.1025256 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2015 Apr;15(4):365-73. doi: 10.1586/14737140.2015.1025256.

Immortalization, understood as the capacity for indefinite expansion, is needed for the generation of any cell line. In the case of v-myc immortalized multipotent human Neural Stem Cells (hNSCs), we hypothesized that v-myc immortalization could induce a more de-differentiated state in v-myc hNSC lines. To test this, we investigated the expression of surface, biochemical and genetic markers of stemness and pluripotency in v-myc immortalized and control hNSCs (primary precursors, that is, neurospheres) and compared these two cell types to human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) and fibroblasts. Using a Hierarchical Clustering method and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the v-myc hNSCs associated with their counterparts hNSCs (in the absence of v-myc) and displayed a differential expression pattern when compared to hESCs. Moreover, the expression analysis of pluripotency markers suggested no evidence supporting a reprogramming-like process despite the increment in telomerase expression. In conclusion, v-myc expression in hNSC lines ensures self-renewal through the activation of some genes involved in the maintenance of stem cell properties in multipotent cells but does not alter the expression of key pluripotency-associated genes.","['Pino-Barrio, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Garcia, Elisa', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Martinez-Serrano, Alberto']","['Pino-Barrio MJ', 'Garcia-Garcia E', 'Menendez P', 'Martinez-Serrano A']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Center of Molecular Biology ""Severo Ochoa"" (CBMSO), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (UAM-CSIC), Campus UAM Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Center of Molecular Biology ""Severo Ochoa"" (CBMSO), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (UAM-CSIC), Campus UAM Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Cell Therapy Program, Facultat de Medicina, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Center of Molecular Biology ""Severo Ochoa"" (CBMSO), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (UAM-CSIC), Campus UAM Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150312,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Oncogene Protein p55(v-myc))']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Oncogene Protein p55(v-myc)/*metabolism', 'Principal Component Analysis']",PMC4357445,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0118499 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-33434 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 12;10(3):e0118499. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0118499. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cellular reprogramming has the potential to provide a novel autologous source of HPCs for transplantation, the applicability of this technology toward the derivation of healthy autologous hematopoietic cells devoid of patient-specific leukemic aberrations from AML patients must first be evaluated. Here, we report the generation of human AML patient-specific hematopoietic progenitors that are capable of normal in vitro differentiation to myeloid lineages and are devoid of leukemia-associated aberration found in matched patient bone marrow. Skin fibroblasts were obtained from AML patients whose leukemic cells possessed a distinct, leukemia-associated aberration, and used to create AML patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Through hematopoietic differentiation of AML patient iPSCs, coupled with cytogenetic interrogation, we reveal that AML patient-specific HPCs possess normal progenitor capacity and are devoid of leukemia-associated mutations. Importantly, in rare patient skin samples that give rise to mosaic fibroblast cultures that continue to carry leukemia-associated mutations; healthy hematopoietic progenitors can also be generated via reprogramming selection. Our findings provide the proof of principle that cellular reprogramming can be applied on a personalized basis to generate healthy HPCs from AML patients, and should further motivate advances toward creating transplantable hematopoietic stem cells for autologous AML therapy.","['Salci, Kyle R', 'Lee, Jong-Hee', 'Laronde, Sarah', 'Dingwall, Steve', 'Kushwah, Rahul', 'Fiebig-Comyn, Aline', 'Leber, Brian', 'Foley, Ronan', 'Dal Cin, Arianna', 'Bhatia, Mickie']","['Salci KR', 'Lee JH', 'Laronde S', 'Dingwall S', 'Kushwah R', 'Fiebig-Comyn A', 'Leber B', 'Foley R', 'Dal Cin A', 'Bhatia M']","['McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, Michael G.

Because quinolone prophylaxis is effective in adults with AML and in transplant populations, ciprofloxacin prophylaxis (CPx) was introduced as the standard for pediatric AML. We report here the impact of CPx in this population. METHODS: Prevalence of fever and neutropenia, frequency and pathogen spectrum of infections, antibiotic use, supportive care and mortality before and after implementation of CPx were retrospectively compared in children with AML. RESULTS: The cohort included 35 patients with de novo and 10 with relapsed AML, who together underwent 153 chemotherapy courses. Fever and neutropenia resulting in the use of empiric antibiotics occurred in 90% of chemotherapy courses (137/153); this was associated with proven bacteremia in 26%. The use of CPx did not change the incidence of febrile or infectious episodes, number of days of fever or antibiotic treatment or mortality. CPx was associated with a significant decrease in infections caused by Gram-negative rods (13.4% vs 4.7%) but a concomitant significant increase in bacteremia caused by viridans streptococci (12% vs 28%), resulting in no significant overall difference in the incidence of bacteremia between the 2 groups (35.9% vs 31.5%). CONCLUSIONS: CPx neither alter the incidence of overall bacteremia nor change the pattern of fever or use of supportive care. Our experience supports further investigation into the use of extended-spectrum quinolone prophylaxis during therapy for pediatric AML.","['Felsenstein, Susanna', 'Orgel, Etan', 'Rushing, Teresa', 'Fu, Cecilia', 'Hoffman, Jill A']","['Felsenstein S', 'Orgel E', 'Rushing T', 'Fu C', 'Hoffman JA']","[""From the *Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California; daggerChildren's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, University of Southern California; and double daggerDepartment of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Bacteria/classification/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciprofloxacin/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/INF.0000000000000591 [doi]', '00006454-201504000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2015 Apr;34(4):e78-84. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000000591.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This question is important because these viruses persist in lymphoid cells and suppress double-stranded DNA-break repair. Consequently, prenatal adenovirus infections may generate the aberrant clones of lymphocytes that precede development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present study was designed to overcome technical limitations of prior work by processing cord blood lymphocytes within a day of collection, and by analyzing sufficient numbers of lymphocytes to detect adenovirus-containing cells at the lower limits determined by our previous studies of tonsil lymphocytes. By this approach, adenoviral DNA was identified in 19 of 517 (3.7%) samples, providing definitive evidence for the occurrence of prenatal infection with species C adenoviruses in a significant fraction of neonates predominantly of African American and Hispanic ancestry. Cord blood samples were also tested for the presence of the ETV6-RUNX1 translocation, the most common genetic abnormality in childhood ALL. Using a nested PCR assay, the ETV6-RUNX1 transcript was detected in four of 196 adenovirus-negative samples and one of 14 adenovirus-positive cord blood samples. These findings indicate that this method will be suitable for determining concordance between adenovirus infection and the leukemia-associated translocations in newborns.","['Ornelles, David A', 'Gooding, Linda R', 'Garnett-Benson, C']","['Ornelles DA', 'Gooding LR', 'Garnett-Benson C']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Emory University School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150312,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/classification/*genetics', 'Adenoviridae Infections/*genetics/*virology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*virology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*virology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",PMC4357425,2015/03/13 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119256 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-47381 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 12;10(3):e0119256. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119256. eCollection 2015.,,,,"['P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was an open-label, single-arm, prospective clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferasirox (DFX) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with serum ferritin levels of at least 1000 ng/mL and ongoing transfusion requirements were enrolled. DFX was administered for up to 1 year. A total of 100 patients were enrolled. RESULTS: Serum ferritin levels decreased significantly following treatment (from 2000 to 1650 ng/mL, p = 0.004). The median absolute reduction in serum ferritin levels was -65 ng/mL in AA (p = 0.037), -647 ng/mL in lower-risk MDS (MDS-LR; p = 0.007), and -552 ng/mL in higher-risk MDS (MDS-HR)/AML (p = 0.482). Mean labile plasma iron (LPI) levels decreased from 0.24 mumol/L at baseline to 0.03 mumol/L at 1 year in all patients (p = 0.036). The mean LPI reduction in each group was -0.17 mumol/L in AA, -0.21 mumol/L in MDS-LR, and -0.30 mumol/L in MDS-HR/AML. Gastrointestinal disorders were commonly observed among groups (16.0%). DFX was temporarily skipped for adverse events in seven patients (7.0%) and was permanently discontinued in 11 patients (11.0%). CONCLUSION: DFX reduced serum ferritin and LPI levels in patients with transfusional iron overload.

Early chemotherapeutic treatments, including alkylating agents, purine nucleoside derivatives, and immunotherapeutic antibodies, only show limited benefits for patients but severe off-target related side effects. Recent advances in understanding of the critical molecular pathways of regulating proliferation and survival of B-CLL cells have spurred a new therapeutical strategy by selectively targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta). Idelalisib, a first-in-class PI3Kdelta-selective small molecule has received the FDA's fast-track approval in July of 2014 as a new treatment of CLL, indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma. Undoubtedly, the success of idelalisib has provided a solid support in the development of PI3Kdelta-specific inhibitors and reformed the concept of treating CLL. However, the number of reported selective inhibitors of PI3Kdelta is very limited and very few have advanced into clinical trials. The mechanism of their actions remains elusive.

The most common extramedullary involvement includes soft tissues and lymph nodes, but it may arise in different sites of the body. There are only very few reports about MS in the pulmonary system, and involvement of the trachea is extremely rare. METHODS: This is the first report of initial presentation of MS by severe acute tracheal stenosis. RESULTS: After failed tracheal dilatation, a tracheostomy was performed where tracheal tissue was submitted for pathology. Histology of the tracheal biopsy and bone marrow revealed AML. The patient was subsequently referred to our oncology service for further management.

The natural cycle is the prototype to which we aspire to emulate in assisted reproduction techniques. Increasing evidence is emerging that controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with exogenous gonadotropins may be detrimental to oogenesis, embryo quality, and endometrial receptivity. This research aimed at assessing the impact of COH on the intrafollicular milieu by comparing follicular fluid (FF) cytokine profiles during stimulated in vitro fertilization (IVF) and modified natural cycle (MNC) IVF. Methods. Ten women undergoing COH IVF and 10 matched women undergoing MNC IVF were recruited for this pilot study. 40 FF cytokine concentrations from individual follicles and plasma were measured by fluid-phase multiplex immunoassay. Demographic/cycle/cytokine data were compared and correlations between cytokines were computed. Results. No significant differences were found between COH and MNC groups for patient and cycle demographics, including outcome. Overall mean FF cytokine levels were higher in the MNC group for 29/40 cytokines, significantly so for leukaemia inhibitory factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha. Furthermore, FF MNC cytokine correlations were significantly stronger than for COH data. Conclusions. These findings suggest that COH perturbs intrafollicular cytokine networks, in terms of both cytokine levels and their interrelationships. This may impact oocyte maturation/fertilization and embryo developmental competence.","['Baskind, N Ellissa', 'Orsi, Nicolas M', 'Sharma, Vinay']","['Baskind NE', 'Orsi NM', 'Sharma V']","['The Leeds Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Seacroft Hospital, York Road, LS14 6UH Leeds, UK.', ""Women's Health Research Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer & Pathology, St James's University Hospital, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, Beckett Street, LS9 7TF Leeds, UK."", 'The Leeds Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Seacroft Hospital, York Road, LS14 6UH Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141130,Egypt,Int J Reprod Med,International journal of reproductive medicine,101633172,,,,PMC4334052,2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/218769 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Reprod Med. 2014;2014:218769. doi: 10.1155/2014/218769.

The tumor-suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) belongs to the serine-threonine phosphatases family and accounts for the majority of serine-threonine phosphatase activity in eukaryotic cells. Numerous studies have shown that inhibition of PP2A expression and/or function may contribute to leukemogenesis in several hematological malignancies. Likewise, overexpression or aberrant expression of physiologic PP2A inhibitory molecules (e.g., SET and its associated SETBP1 and CIP2A) may turn off PP2A function and participate to leukemic progression. The discovery of PP2A as tumor suppressor has prompted the evaluation of the safety and the efficacy of new compounds, which can restore PP2A activity in leukemic cells. Although further studies are needed to better understand how PP2A acts in the intricate phosphatases/kinases cancer network, the results reviewed herein strongly support the development on new PP2A-activating drugs and the immediate introduction of those available into clinical protocols for leukemia patients refractory or resistant to current available therapies.","['Ciccone, Maria', 'Calin, George A', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Ciccone M', 'Calin GA', 'Perrotti D']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150216,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC4329809,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/03/13 06:01,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00021 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Feb 16;5:21. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00021. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['PADs', 'PP2A', 'SET', 'phosphatases', 'tumor suppressor']","['R01 CA163800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH2 TR000943/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some reports showed that expression of ZAP70 gene and chromosomal abnormality are two prognostic factors in management of B-CLL. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we determined ZAP70 mRNA expression level in the del17p13, del6q21 and del11q13 subgroups of Iranian B-CLL patients to investigate prognostic value of ZAP70 expression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was carried out on 66 Iranian B-CLL patients. Zap70 mRNA expression was evaluated by using Real Time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Molecular analysis showed that ZAP70 expression increased 2.46 fold in the del11q13 subgroup, 2.87 fold in the del17p13 and 1.87 fold in the del6q21, compared to the 15 patients in the control group. Comparison of standard deviation and mean of the ZAP70 expression profile within the subgroups showed more variability among the cases of the del11q13 and del17p13 versus tight clustering for the del6q21. Therefore, there is a relation between del6q21 aberrations; which has good prognosis with normal levels of ZAP70 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results of ANOVA test showed that ZAP70 expression gene was significantly increased in del17p13 and del11q13 subgroups compared to control group. Thus, ZAP70 may play an important role in the prognosis of B-CLL patients.","['Jafari Ghahfarokhi, Hamideh', 'Ashoori, Saeede', 'Akbari, Mohamad Taghi', 'Lotfizadeh, Masoud', 'Karimi, Ali', 'Teimori, Hossein']","['Jafari Ghahfarokhi H', 'Ashoori S', 'Akbari MT', 'Lotfizadeh M', 'Karimi A', 'Teimori H']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, IR Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, IR Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Department of Public Health, Social Health Determinants Research Center, School of Health, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, IR Iran.', 'Medical Plant Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, IR Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, IR Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141116,Iran,Iran Red Crescent Med J,Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,101319850,,,,PMC4329929,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/03/13 06:01,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/ircmj.22528 [doi]'],epublish,Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2014 Nov 16;16(11):e22528. doi: 10.5812/ircmj.22528. eCollection 2014 Nov.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromosomal Abnormality', 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'ZAP70 Expression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects were dose-dependent, with inhibition of downstream signaling and functional effects correlating with the degree of Mer or Flt3 kinase inhibition. Treatment of primary AML patient samples expressing Mer and/or Flt3-ITD with UNC1666 also inhibited Mer and Flt3 intracellular signaling, induced apoptosis, and inhibited colony formation.

Models for multi-state data have been the theme of many recent published works. Motivated by bone marrow transplant data, we propose a Bayesian model using the gap times between two successive events in a path of events experienced by a subject. Path specific frailties are introduced to capture the dependence structure of the gap times in the paths with two or more states. Under improper prior distributions for the parameters, we establish propriety of the posterior distribution.

Clinical trials typically focus on single agents despite the routine emergence of resistant subclones and experience in blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia arguing against this strategy. Inclusion of only relapsed-refractory, or unfit newly diagnosed, patients risks falsely negative results. There is uncertainty as to whether eligibility should require demonstration of the putative target and regarding therapeutic end points. Although use of in vivo preclinical models employing primary leukemic cells is first choice, newer preclinical models including ""organoids"" and combinations of pharmacologic and genetic approaches may better align models with human AML. We advocate earlier inclusion of combinations +/- chemotherapy and of newly diagnosed patients into clinical trials. When a drug plausibly targets a pathway uniquely related to a specific genetic aberration, eligibility should begin with this subset, including patients with other malignancies, with subsequent extension to other patients. In other cases, a more open-minded approach to initial eligibility would facilitate quicker identification of responsive subsets. Complete remission without minimal residual disease seems a particularly useful short-term end point. Genotypic and phenotypic studies should be prespecified and performed routinely to distinguish responders from nonresponders.","['Estey, Elihu', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Estey E', 'Levine RL', 'Lowenberg B']","['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150311,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31784-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-561373 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 16;125(16):2461-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-01-561373.

Rs3865444 is in linkage disequilibrium with rs12459419 which has been associated with efficacy of an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapeutic agent based on a CD33 antibody. We seek to evaluate the extent to which CD33 genetics in AD and AML can inform one another and advance human disease therapy. We have previously shown that these SNPs are associated with skipping of CD33 exon 2 in brain mRNA. Here, we report that these CD33 SNPs are associated with exon 2 skipping in leukocytes from AML patients and with a novel CD33 splice variant that retains CD33 intron 1. Each copy of the minor rs12459419T allele decreases prototypic full-length CD33 expression by approximately 25% and decreases the AD odds ratio by approximately 0.10. These results suggest that CD33 antagonists may be useful in reducing AD risk. CD33 inhibitors may include humanized CD33 antibodies such as lintuzumab which was safe but ineffective in AML clinical trials. Here, we report that lintuzumab downregulates cell-surface CD33 by 80% in phorbol-ester differentiated U937 cells, at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. Overall, we propose a model wherein a modest effect on RNA splicing is sufficient to mediate the CD33 association with AD risk and suggest the potential for an anti-CD33 antibody as an AD-relevant pharmacologic agent.","['Malik, Manasi', 'Chiles, Joe 3rd', 'Xi, Hualin S', 'Medway, Christopher', 'Simpson, James', 'Potluri, Shobha', 'Howard, Dianna', 'Liang, Ying', 'Paumi, Christian M', 'Mukherjee, Shubhabrata', 'Crane, Paul', 'Younkin, Steven', 'Fardo, David W', 'Estus, Steven']","['Malik M', 'Chiles J 3rd', 'Xi HS', 'Medway C', 'Simpson J', 'Potluri S', 'Howard D', 'Liang Y', 'Paumi CM', 'Mukherjee S', 'Crane P', 'Younkin S', 'Fardo DW', 'Estus S']","['Department of Physiology, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging .', 'Department of Physiology, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging .', 'Computational Sciences Center of Emphasis, Pfizer Inc., Cambridge, MA 02140, USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL 32224, USA and.', 'Department of Physiology, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging .', 'Rinat-Pfizer, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Toxicology.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL 32224, USA and.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging , Steve.Estus@uky.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150311,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4498153,2015/03/13 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ddv092 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddv092 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2015 Jun 15;24(12):3557-70. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddv092.

During the past decade, the identification of key genetic and epigenetic alterations in patients has improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. However, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to the pathogenesis of MDS have largely remained obscure. Recently, essential evidence supporting the direct role of innate immune abnormalities in MDS has been obtained, including the identification of multiple key regulators that are overexpressed or constitutively activated in BM hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Mounting experimental results indicate that the dysregulation of these molecules leads to abnormal hematopoiesis, unbalanced cell death and proliferation in patients' BM, and has an important role in the pathogenesis of MDS. Furthermore, there is compelling evidence that the deregulation of innate immune and inflammatory signaling also affects other cells from the immune system and the BM microenvironment, which establish aberrant associations with hematopoietic precursors and contribute to the MDS phenotype. Therefore, the deregulation of innate immune and inflammatory signaling should be considered as one of the driving forces in the pathogenesis of MDS. In this article, we review and update the advances in this field, summarizing the results from the most recent studies and discussing their clinical implications.","['Ganan-Gomez, I', 'Wei, Y', 'Starczynowski, D T', 'Colla, S', 'Yang, H', 'Cabrero-Calvo, M', 'Bohannan, Z S', 'Verma, A', 'Steidl, U', 'Garcia-Manero, G']","['Ganan-Gomez I', 'Wei Y', 'Starczynowski DT', 'Colla S', 'Yang H', 'Cabrero-Calvo M', 'Bohannan ZS', 'Verma A', 'Steidl U', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""1] Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA [2] Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medicine (Oncology), Einstein/Montefiore Medical Center, New York, NY, USA [2] Albert Einstein Cancer Center and Ruth L. and David S.

Imatinib is clinically active in FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive diseases. Using in vitro screening to identify imatinib-resistant mutations, we frequently detected a Phe to Ser exchange at position 604 (F604S) of FIP1L1-PDGFRA alone or in combination with other exchanges. Surprisingly, FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S did not increase the biochemical or cellular IC50 value of imatinib when compared with unmutated FIP1L1-PDGFRA. However, FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S more efficiently induced growth factor independence in cell lines and primary mouse bone marrow cells. Pulse chase analysis revealed that the F604S exchange strongly stabilized FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S. The F604S mutation creates a binding site for the phosphatase domain of SHP-2, leading to lower autophosphorylation of FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S. This is associated with a reduced activation of SRC and CBL by FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S compared with the unmutated oncogene. As SRC inhibition and knockdown resulted in FIP1L1-PDGFRA stabilization, this explains the extended half-life of FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S. Interestingly, FIP1L1-PDGFRA/L629P, a recently identified mutation in an imatinib-resistant CEL patient, also showed protein stabilization similar to that observed with FIP1L1-PDGFRA/F604S. Therefore, resistance mutations in FIP1L1-PDGFRA that do not interfere with drug binding but rather increase target protein stability seem to be one of the drug-resistance mechanisms in FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive disease.","['Gorantla, S P', 'Zirlik, K', 'Reiter, A', 'Yu, C', 'Illert, A L', 'Von Bubnoff, N', 'Duyster, J']","['Gorantla SP', 'Zirlik K', 'Reiter A', 'Yu C', 'Illert AL', 'Von Bubnoff N', 'Duyster J']","['1] Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150312,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Stability/*drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*chemistry/*genetics']",,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201570 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1763-70. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.70.

Removing immunosuppressive cells before treatment can enhance efficacy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) may be of interest to combine with immunotherapy, as it has been shown that the inhibitor sunitinib reduces myeloid suppressor cells in patients with renal cell carcinoma and dasatinib promotes expansion of natural killer-like lymphocytes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this study, the capacity of dasatinib and imatinib to reduce myeloid suppressor cells and to induce immunomodulation in vivo was investigated ex vivo. Samples from CML patients treated with imatinib (n = 18) or dasatinib (n = 14) within a Nordic clinical trial (clinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00852566) were investigated for the presence of CD11b(+)CD14(-)CD33(+) myeloid cells and inhibitory molecules (arginase I, myeloperoxidase, IL10) as well as the presence of natural killer cells, T cells (naive/memory), and stimulatory cytokines (IL12, IFNgamma, MIG, IP10). Both imatinib and dasatinib decreased the presence of CD11b(+)CD14(-)CD33(+) myeloid cells as well as the inhibitory molecules and the remaining myeloid suppressor cells had an increased CD40 expression. Monocytes also increased CD40 after therapy. Moreover, increased levels of CD40, IL12, natural killer cells, and experienced T cells were noted after TKI initiation. The presence of experienced T cells was correlated to a higher IFNgamma and MIG plasma concentration. Taken together, the results demonstrate that both imatinib and dasatinib tilted the immunosuppressive CML tumor milieu towards promoting immune stimulation. Hence, imatinib and dasatinib may be of interest to combine with cancer immunotherapy.","['Christiansson, Lisa', 'Soderlund, Stina', 'Mangsbo, Sara', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Richter, Johan', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Loskog, Angelica', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla']","['Christiansson L', 'Soderlund S', 'Mangsbo S', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Hoglund M', 'Markevarn B', 'Richter J', 'Stenke L', 'Mustjoki S', 'Loskog A', 'Olsson-Stromberg U']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratories, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the breakdown of spending on the components of cancer care. Cancer decedents in 2009 were identified from the Korean Central Cancer Registry and linked with the Korean National Health Insurance Claims Database. The final number of patients included in the study was 70,558. RESULTS: In 2009, the average cancer care cost during the last year of life was US $15,720. Patients under age 20 spent US $53,890 while those 70 or over spent US $11,801. Those with leukemia incurred the highest costs (US $43,219) while bladder cancer patients spent the least (US $13,155). General costs, drugs other than analgesics, and test fees were relatively high (29.7%, 23.8%, and 20.7% of total medical costs, respectively). Analgesic drugs, rehabilitation, and psychotherapy were still relatively low (4.3%, 0.7%, and 0.1%, respectively). Among the results of multiple regression analysis, few were notable. Age was found to be negatively related to cancer care costs while income level was positively associated. Those classified under distant Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results stages of cancer and higher comorbidity level also incurred higher cancer care costs. CONCLUSION: Average cancer care costs varied significantly by patient characteristics. However, the study results suggest an underutilization of support services likely due to lack of alternative accommodations for terminal cancer patients. Further examination of utilization patterns of healthcare resources will help provide tailored evidence for policymakers in efforts to reduce the burdens of cancer care.","['Hwang, Inuk', 'Shin, Dong Wook', 'Kang, Kyoung Hee', 'Yang, Hyung Kook', 'Kim, So Young', 'Park, Jong-Hyock']","['Hwang I', 'Shin DW', 'Kang KH', 'Yang HK', 'Kim SY', 'Park JH']","['National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Health Promotion Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; Cancer Survivorship Clinic, Seoul National University Cancer Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Koarea.', 'National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Chungbuk Regional Cardiocerebrovascular Center, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Health Science Business Convergence, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea ; Department of Preventive Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', '*Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health', 'Leukemia/economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*economics', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Registries', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Terminal Care/economics', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/economics', 'Young Adult']",PMC4720102,2015/03/13 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4143/crt.2014.088 [doi]', 'crt.2014.088 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2016 Jan;48(1):365-75. doi: 10.4143/crt.2014.088.

To capture the impacts of these genes on ALL risk in the California Hispanic population, we comprehensively assessed the variation within the genes and further assessed the joint effects between the genetic variation and surrogates for early-life infections (the presence of older siblings, daycare attendance, and ear infections). METHODS: Genotypic data for 323 Hispanic ALL cases and 454 controls from the California Childhood Leukemia Study were generated using Illumina OmniExpress v1 platform. Logistic regression assuming a log-additive model estimated odds ratios (OR) associated with each SNP, adjusted for age, sex, and the first five principal components. In addition, we examined potential interactions between six ALL risk alleles and surrogates for early-life infections using logistic regression models that included an interaction term. RESULTS: Significant associations between genotypes at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and ALL risk were identified: rs7780012, OR 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.71 (p = 0.004); rs7089424, OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.65 (p = 1.16 x 10(-9)); rs4982731, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.37-2.08 (p = 2.35 x 10(-6)), respectively. Evidence for multiplicative interactions between genetic variants and surrogates for early-life infections with ALL risk was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings in non-Hispanic White population, our study showed that variants within IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE were associated with increased ALL risk, and the effects for ARID5B and CEBPE were most prominent in the high-hyperdiploid ALL subtype in the California Hispanic population.

Here, we characterize a mitotic stress response that determines cell fate in response to microtubule poisons. We show that mitotic arrest induced by these drugs produces a temporally controlled DNA damage response (DDR) characterized by the caspase-dependent formation of gammaH2AX foci in non-apoptotic cells. Following exit from a delayed mitosis, this initial response results in activation of DDR protein kinases, phosphorylation of the tumour suppressor p53 and a delay in subsequent cell cycle progression. We show that this response is controlled by Mcl-1, a regulator of caspase activation that becomes degraded during mitotic arrest. Chemical inhibition of Mcl-1 and the related proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by a BH3 mimetic enhances the mitotic DDR, promotes p53 activation and inhibits subsequent cell cycle progression. We also show that inhibitors of DDR protein kinases as well as BH3 mimetics promote apoptosis synergistically with taxol (paclitaxel) in a variety of cancer cell lines. Our work demonstrates the role of mitotic DNA damage responses in determining cell fate in response to microtubule poisons and BH3 mimetics, providing a rationale for anti-cancer combination chemotherapies.","['Colin, Didier J', 'Hain, Karolina O', 'Allan, Lindsey A', 'Clarke, Paul R']","['Colin DJ', 'Hain KO', 'Allan LA', 'Clarke PR']","['Division of Cancer Research, Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK p.r.clarke@dundee.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Open Biol,Open biology,101580419,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/metabolism', '*Mitosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4389791,2015/03/13 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2015/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['rsob.140156 [pii]', '10.1098/rsob.140156 [doi]']",ppublish,Open Biol. 2015 Mar;5(3):140156. doi: 10.1098/rsob.140156.,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'apoptosis', 'caspase', 'mitosis', 'paclitaxel']","['12-0105/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'C275/A13424/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3525-2622'],,,,,,,,,,

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 231 parents of children with leukemia and 261 parents of children with acute diseases in hospitals. Parents completed questionnaires on anxiety, TDP, social support, coping styles, children's clinical characteristics, and demographic characteristics. Parents of children with leukemia showed higher prevalence of anxiety (64.5% vs 40.2%, P < 0.01) and TDP (44.2% vs 24.1%, P < 0.01) compared with controls. TDP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.34, P < 0.01), lower social support (OR = 1.92, P = 0.02), and less positive coping (OR = 1.87, P = 0.02) were independently associated with anxiety. Parents with TDP showed lower social support and less positive coping, but more negative coping compared with those without. Moreover, multiple mediation analyses revealed that the significant effect of TDP on anxiety was partially mediated by social support and positive coping. In conclusion, anxiety and TDP were highly prevalent in parents of children with leukemia. The predictive factors could be used to identify those parents who are at high risk of anxiety and may also be targets for prevention and intervention.","['Chen, Jie', 'Liu, Yang', 'Cai, Qing-Qing', 'Liu, Yi-Min', 'Wang, Tong', 'Zhang, Kun', 'Wang, Jing-Feng', 'Chen, Wei-Qing', 'Huang, Hui']","['Chen J', 'Liu Y', 'Cai QQ', 'Liu YM', 'Wang T', 'Zhang K', 'Wang JF', 'Chen WQ', 'Huang H']","['From the Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (JC, YL, TW, KZ, JFW, HH); Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (JC, YL, YML, TW, KZ, JFW, HH); Department of Internal Medicine (QQC), Cancer Center; and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (WQC), School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Prevalence', '*Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological', '*Type D Personality']",PMC4602458,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/05/07 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000627 [doi]', '00005792-201503020-00020 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2015 Mar;94(10):e627. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000627.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various mechanisms have been identified to explain how C/EBPalpha functions in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). C/EBPalpha expression is suppressed as a result of common leukemia-associated genetic and epigenetic alterations such as AML1-ETO, RARalpha-PLZF or gene promoter methylation. Recent data have shown that ubiquitination modification also contributes to its downregulation. In addition, 10-15% of patients with AML in an intermediate cytogenetic risk subgroup were characterized by mutations of the C/EBPalpha gene. As a transcription factor, C/EBPalpha can translocate into the nucleus and further regulate a variety of genes directly or indirectly, which are all key factors for cell differentiation. This review summarizes recent reports concerning the dysregulation of C/EBPalpha expression at various levels in human AML. The currently available data are persuasive evidence suggesting that impaired abnormal C/EBPalpha expression contributes to the development of AML, and restoration of C/EBPalpha expression as well as its function represents a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Song, Guanhua', 'Wang, Lin', 'Bi, Kehong', 'Jiang, Guosheng']","['Song G', 'Wang L', 'Bi K', 'Jiang G']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory for Modern Medicine and Technology of Shandong Province, Key Laboratory for Rare and Uncommon Diseases, Key Medical Laboratory for Tumor Immunology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Immunology of Shandong Province, Jinan, Shandong 250062, P.R.

METHODS: According to cytogenetic characteristics, 106 children with AML were divided into three groups: patients with normal karyotype (Group A, n=26), patients with abnormal karyotype who had no loss of sex chromosomes (Group B, n=52), and patients with abnormal karyotype who had loss of sex chromosomes (Group C, n=28). Prognosis was compared between the three groups. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of Groups A, B, and C were (38.9+/-11.2)%, (59.3+/-7.3)%, and (66.5+/-10.5)%, respectively; the EFS of Group C was significantly higher than that of Group A (P=0.035). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of Groups A, B, and C were (54.3+/-13.5)%, (68.1+/-7.7)%, and (77.9+/-9.8)%, respectively (P>0.05). The 5-year EFS of 58 patients with t(8;21) was (63.3+/-7.3)%, significantly higher than that of patients with normal karyotype (P=0.015). All the 28 cases in Group C had t(8;21), and their 5-year EFS was not significantly different from that of patients with t(8;21) in Group B (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Loss of sex chromosomes is a favorable karyotype in children with AML M2 subtype and the patients in this group mostly have t(8;21). Why loss of sex chromosomes indicates a favorable prognosis is probably because it is accompanied by t(8;21) in the patients.","['Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Zhang, Le-Ping', 'Liu, Gui-Lan']","['Jia YP', 'Zuo YX', 'Lu AD', 'Zhang LP', 'Liu GL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. zuoyingxi@pkuph.edu.cn.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', '*Sex Chromosome Aberrations', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2015.02.012 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2015 Feb;17(2):168-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-limiting offtarget effects and intrinsic drug resistance result in the inefficient eradication of leukemic blast cells and their survival beyond remission. This minimal residual disease is the major cause of relapse and is responsible for a 5-year survival rate of only 24%. More specific and efficient approaches are therefore required to eradicate malignant cells while leaving healthy cells unaffected. In this study, we generated scFv antibodies that bind specifically to the surface of AML blast cells and AML bone marrow biopsy specimens. We isolated the antibodies by phage display, using subtractive whole-cell panning with AML M2derived Kasumi1 cells. By selecting for internalizing scFv antibody fragments, we focused on potentially novel agents for intracellular drug delivery and tumor modulation. Two independent methods showed that 4 binders were internalized by Kasumi-1 cells. Furthermore, we observed the AMLselective inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis by a recombinant immunotoxin comprising one scFv fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA'). This method may therefore be useful for the selection of novel disease-specific internalizing antibody fragments, providing a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML patients.","['Fitting, Jenny', 'Blume, Tobias', 'Ten Haaf, Andre', 'Blau, Wolfgang', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Tur, Mehmet Kemal', 'Barth, Stefan']","['Fitting J', 'Blume T', 'Ten Haaf A', 'Blau W', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Tur MK', 'Barth S']","['a Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy; Institute of Applied Medical Engineering; Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering ; University Hospital RWTH Aachen ; Aachen , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity/genetics', '*Bacterial Toxins/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Exotoxins/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Immunotoxins/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', '*Single-Chain Antibodies/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', '*Virulence Factors/genetics/immunology/pharmacology']",PMC4622674,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19420862.2015.1007818 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2015;7(2):390-402. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2015.1007818.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML immunohistochemistry', 'AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'CDR, Complementarity Determining Region', 'ETA, Pseudomonas exotoxin A', 'PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'anti-AML antibody fragments', 'in vitro efficacy', 'internalizing phage antibodies', 'phage display technology', 'primary AML blast cells', 'recombinant immunotoxin', 'scFv, single chain variable fragment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which O. japonicus extract affects the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, its association with the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) genes in phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells and how it mediates the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay, mRNA expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein expression was measured by western blot analysis. It was demonstrated that O. japonicus suppressed the mRNA expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In addition, O. japonicus was found to downregulate iNOS and COX-2 transcription and translocation. Furthermore, O. japonicus inhibited NF-kappaB p65 activity as well as the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, MAPK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). The present results suggested that O. japonicus inhibited not only MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression, but also iNOS and COX-2 gene expression, suppressed NF-kappaB activation and reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, MEK and ERK. The present results therefore indicated that O. japonicus was able to inhibit the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and suppress the transcription and translocation of iNOS and COX-2 by directly inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway in THP-1 cells.","['Kim, Young Il', 'Park, Seung-Won', 'Yoon, Yeo-Kwang', 'Lee, Kyung-Wook', 'Lee, Jang-Hoon', 'Woo, Hong-Jung', 'Kim, Youngchul']","['Kim YI', 'Park SW', 'Yoon YK', 'Lee KW', 'Lee JH', 'Woo HJ', 'Kim Y']","['Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Seoul 130872, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Catholic University of Daegu, Daegu 712702, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130872, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130872, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130872, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130872, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130872, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150310,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crassulaceae/chemistry', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/administration & dosage']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/01/12 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2015.3460 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2015 Jul;12(1):657-62. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2015.3460.

Their descriptions in the literature are largely limited to a few case series. We analyzed the spectrum of these lymphomas diagnosed by peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) examination. METHODS: Over a period of 6 years, 75 patients were diagnosed with a lymphoma from PB/BM who had presented with predominant splenomegaly. Their clinical and laboratory records including PB and BM morphology; immunophenotyping using multi-parametric flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry were reviewed. Wherever indicated, an extended panel of immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on BM biopsies for accurate sub-classification. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The commonest lymphomas were hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (32%) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) (24%). Others included diffuse large B cell lymphoma (8%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (8%), mantle cell lymphoma (2.7%), and follicular lymphoma (1.3%), all of which usually presents with lymphadenopathy. SMZL was the commonest lymphoma among females and those with massive splenomegaly and lymphocytosis; while HCL was commonest in patients with pancytopenia. SMZL commonly presented with lymphocytosis; however, 22% of them also presented with pancytopenia. CONCLUSION: The high diagnostic efficacy of PB and BM examination using flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry in confirming and sub-classifying splenic lymphomas suggests that a thorough hematological evaluation should always precede a diagnostic splenectomy. Immunohistochemistry remains the best modality to identify sparse or intra-sinusoidal infiltration on BM biopsy and is particularly useful in patients with fibrotic marrows and pancytopenia.","['Sreedharanunni, Sreejesh', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Ahluwalia, Jasmina', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Prakash, Gaurav', 'Khadwal, Alka', 'Sharma, Prashant', 'Kumar, Narender', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Das, Reena']","['Sreedharanunni S', 'Sachdeva MU', 'Malhotra P', 'Ahluwalia J', 'Naseem S', 'Prakash G', 'Khadwal A', 'Sharma P', 'Kumar N', 'Varma N', 'Varma S', 'Das R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150311,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/*diagnosis/pathology']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/07/13 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000005 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Oct;20(9):530-7. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000005.

Large-scale studies of de novo CD5+ DLBCL are lacking in Western countries. In this study by the DLBCL Rituximab-CHOP Consortium, CD5 was expressed in 5.5% of 879 DLBCL patients from Western countries. CD5+ DLBCL was associated with higher frequencies of >1 ECOG performance status, bone marrow involvement, central nervous system relapse, activated B-cell-like subtype, Bcl-2 overexpression, and STAT3 and NF-kappaB activation, whereas rarely expressed single-stranded DNA-binding protein 2 (SSBP2), CD30 or had MYC mutations. With standard R-CHOP chemotherapy, CD5+ DLBCL patients had significantly worse overall survival (median, 25.3 months vs. not reached, P< .0001) and progression-free survival (median, 21.3 vs. 85.8 months, P< .0001) than CD5- DLBCL patients, which was independent of Bcl-2, STAT3, NF-kappaB and the International Prognostic Index. Interestingly, SSBP2 expression abolished the prognostic significance of CD5 expression, suggesting a tumor-suppressor role of SSBP2 for CD5 signaling. Gene-expression profiling demonstrated that B-cell receptor signaling dysfunction and microenvironment alterations are the important mechanisms underlying the clinical impact of CD5 expression. This study shows the distinctive clinical and biological features of CD5+ DLBCL patients in Western countries and underscores important pathways with therapeutic implications.","['Xu-Monette, Zijun Y', 'Tu, Meifeng', 'Jabbar, Kausar J', 'Cao, Xin', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Visco, Carol', 'Nagarajan, Lalitha', 'Cai, Qingqing', 'Montes-Moreno, Santiago', 'An, Yuji', 'Dybkaer, Karen', 'Chiu, April', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Zu, Youli', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Richards, Kristy L', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Choi, William W L', 'van Krieken, J Han', 'Huh, Jooryung', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Ferreri, Andres J M', 'Zhao, Xiaoying', 'Moller, Michael B', 'Farnen, John P', 'Winter, Jane N', 'Piris, Miguel A', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Young, Ken H']","['Xu-Monette ZY', 'Tu M', 'Jabbar KJ', 'Cao X', 'Tzankov A', 'Visco C', 'Nagarajan L', 'Cai Q', 'Montes-Moreno S', 'An Y', 'Dybkaer K', 'Chiu A', 'Orazi A', 'Zu Y', 'Bhagat G', 'Richards KL', 'Hsi ED', 'Choi WW', 'van Krieken JH', 'Huh J', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Zhao X', 'Moller MB', 'Farnen JP', 'Winter JN', 'Piris MA', 'Miranda RN', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Young KH']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Department of Genetics and Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'University of Hong Kong Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong, China.', 'Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'San Raffaele H.

Despite advances, 20% of pediatric and the majority of adult patients with T-ALL succumb to mortality from resistant or relapsed disease, and the survival rate for patients with resistant or relapsed T-ALL remains poor. Alterations in the expression of Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) have been detected in several types of cancer, and the inhibition of FoxM1 has been investigated as therapeutic strategy in cancer. The present study investigated the effects of the inhibition of FoxM1 by thiostrepton in human T-ALL Jurkat cells. The cells were treated with different concentrations of thiostrepton, either alone or in combination with doxorubicin. Cell viability was measured using CCK-8 assays and the cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and cell-associated mean fluorescence intensity of intracellular doxorubicin were assessed using flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The inhibition of FoxM1 by thiostrepton significantly decreased the proliferation of the Jurkat cells proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell arrest at the G2/M phase, and apoptosis was significantly increased in the thiostrepton-treated Jurkat cells. Thiostrepton reduced the half maximal inhibitory concentration of doxorubicin in the Jurkat cells, and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin within the Jurkat cells by enhancing doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and increasing the accumulation of intracellular doxorubicin. Furthermore, the inhibition of FoxM1 by thiostrepton enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, possibly through a caspase-3-dependent pathway, and increased the accumulation of intracellular doxorubicin, possibly through downregulating the expression of glutathione S-transferase pi. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that targeting FoxM1 with thiostrepton resulted in potent antileukemia activity and chemosensitizing effects in human T-ALL Jurkat cells.","['Wang, Jian-Yong', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Xing, Hai-Yan', 'Li, You-Jie', 'Fan, Wen-Wen', 'Li, Na', 'Xie, Shu-Yang']","['Wang JY', 'Jia XH', 'Xing HY', 'Li YJ', 'Fan WW', 'Li N', 'Xie SY']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, P.R.

In the present study, we investigated whether hFTUC-derived stem cells are able to differentiate into germ cells. The hFTUC-derived stem cells were first isolated, expanded and then cultured in differentiation medium containing human follicular fluid, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol for 24 days. During the period of induction, a subpopulation of the cultured cells appeared that had a morphological resemblance to primordial germ cells (PGCs) and cumulus-oocyte complex (COC)-like cells, and oocyte-like cells (OLCs). The PGC-like cells expressed specific markers indicative of germ cell formation such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1), B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp1), PR domain containing 14 (Prdm14), transcription factor AP-2 gamma (Tfap2C), VASA, STELLA, deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3). The OLCs, which contained a single germinal vesicle, expressed oocyte-specific markers, such as synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3), growth/differentiation factor-9 (GDF9), GDF9B and zona pellucida (ZP)1, ZP2 and ZP3. The COC-like cells secreted estradiol, vascular endothelial growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor. Thus, our findings suggest that hFTUC-derived stem cells have an intrinsic ability to differentiate into OLCs, which may provide an in vitro model for the identification of factors involved in germ cell formation and differentiation.","['Hu, Xiang', 'Lu, Hua', 'Cao, Sheng', 'Deng, Yan-Li', 'Li, Qi-Jia', 'Wan, Qian', 'Yie, Shang-Mian']","['Hu X', 'Lu H', 'Cao S', 'Deng YL', 'Li QJ', 'Wan Q', 'Yie SM']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The Second Medical College/Teaching Hospital, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R.

However, the accuracy of pharmacy data from administrative/billing datasets have not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to determine the concordance of Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) administrative/billing chemotherapy data with Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol-mandated chemotherapy and to assess the implications of this level of concordance for further PHIS research. PROCEDURE: Data from 384 pediatric patients (1,060 courses of chemotherapy) with acute myeloid leukemia treated on COG clinical trial AAML0531 were previously merged with PHIS data. PHIS chemotherapy administrative/billing data were reviewed for the first three courses of chemotherapy. Accuracy was assessed using three metrics: recognizability of chemotherapy pattern by course, chemotherapy administration pattern by individual medication, and concordance with the number of days of protocol-defined chemotherapy. RESULTS: The chemotherapy pattern was recognizable in 87.3% of courses when course-wide accuracy was assessed. Chemotherapy administration pattern varied by medication. Cytarabine had perfect concordance 70.9% of the time, daunorubicin had perfect concordance 77.4% of the time, and etoposide had perfect concordance 67.8% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of chemotherapy administrative/billing data supports the continued use of PHIS data for epidemiology studies as long as investigators perform data quality control checks and evaluate each specific medication prior to undertaking definitive analyses.","['Miller, Tamara P', 'Troxel, Andrea B', 'Li, Yimei', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Hall, Matt', 'Torp, Kari', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Rubin, David', 'Luger, Selina', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Miller TP', 'Troxel AB', 'Li Y', 'Huang YS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Hall M', 'Torp K', 'Fisher BT', 'Bagatell R', 'Seif AE', 'Sung L', 'Gamis A', 'Rubin D', 'Luger S', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology The Perelman School of Medicine, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Preventative Medicine, University of Southern California, Arcadia, California.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, California."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, California."", ""Children's Hospital Association, Overland Park, Kansas."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'The University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150311,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', '*Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Information Systems/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Young Adult']",PMC4433587,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25475 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jul;62(7):1184-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25475.

A previous study identified mature miR-126-3p as an onco-microRNA that is generated from the premicroRNA, miR-126. Although miR-126 also generates mature miR-126-5p, its function is less clear. In the present study, the relationship between miR-126-5p/3p expression levels and overall survival in 109 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received intensive therapy were evaluated. Higher expression levels above the median value of miR-126-5p/3p were correlated with a poorer overall survival. The hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the higher expression group relative to the lower expression group of miR-126-5p/3p were 2.098 (95% CI: 1.075-4.228) and 1.958 (95% CI: 1.001-3.927), respectively. An interaction was not observed between the hazard ratios of miR-126-5p and miR126-3p (p=0.73). Transfection of the mimic miR-126-5p into the AML cell line, KG-1, resulted in a decrease in the sensitivity to cytarabin and the expression level of Klotho mRNA as well as the elevation in the phosphorylation of Akt. The results of the present study demonstrated that higher expression levels of miR-126-5p/3p in patients with AML resulted in a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, miR-126-5p elevated the phosphorylation of Akt.","['Shibayama, Yoshihiko', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Ohya, Hiroki', 'Fujisawa, Shin-Ichi', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Iseki, Ken']","['Shibayama Y', 'Kondo T', 'Ohya H', 'Fujisawa S', 'Teshima T', 'Iseki K']","['Education Research Center for Clinical Pharmacy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Hokkaido University Hospital, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150306,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",PMC4391586,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/01/07 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.3839 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2015 May;33(5):2176-82. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.3839.

In this review we examine current ideas as to the nature of this functional role in mast cell activation. Mechanistically, there is controversy as to the candidate proteins responsible for phosphatidylserine translocation from the internal to external leaflet, and here we review the candidacies of mast cell PLSCR1 and TMEM16F. Finally we examine the potential relationship between functionally important mast cell membrane perturbations and phosphatidylserine exposure during activation.","['Rysavy, Noel M', 'Shimoda, Lori M N', 'Dixon, Alyssa M', 'Speck, Mark', 'Stokes, Alexander J', 'Turner, Helen', 'Umemoto, Eric Y']","['Rysavy NM', 'Shimoda LM', 'Dixon AM', 'Speck M', 'Stokes AJ', 'Turner H', 'Umemoto EY']","[""a Laboratory of Immunology and Signal Transduction ; Department of Biology; Chaminade University ; Honolulu , Hawai'i USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Bioarchitecture,Bioarchitecture,101518332,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Mast Cells', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism']",PMC4914033,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19490992.2014.995516 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioarchitecture. 2014;4(4-5):127-37. doi: 10.1080/19490992.2014.995516.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCA, ABC binding cassette family A', 'CRAC, calcium release activated channel', 'GPMV, giant plasma membrane vesicle', 'ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif', 'PLA2, phospholipase A2', 'PLSCR, phospholipid scramblase', 'PMA, phorbol 12,13-myristate acetate', 'RBL, rat basophilic leukemia', 'RFU, relative fluorescence units', 'ROI, region of interest', 'TMEM, transmembrane protein', 'TMEM16F', 'WGA, wheat germ agglutinin', 'mast cells', 'membrane lipids', 'phosphatidylserine']","['P20 GM103466/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 MD006084/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD007584/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', '2P20GM103466/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: A 4-year-old boy with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma was successfully treated with chemotherapy in 2011. However, in May 2012, he developed secondary AML. Although he was treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation, tumor lysis syndrome occurred with renal and heart failure complications. After an ultrasound examination by pediatricians found bilateral subretinal protrusions, he was referred to our clinic. Fundus examinations confirmed that the protrusions were bilateral subretinal or choroidal hemorrhages. A few weeks later, dense vitreous hemorrhages occurred bilaterally, and he completely lost vision in both eyes. Electroretinograms were extinguished in both eyes. After improvement of his general condition, we performed a 25-gauge vitrectomy combined with lens extraction in his left eye in December 2012. After removal of the vitreous hemorrhage, we found the subretinal hemorrhage had already been absorbed, leaving a mottled fundus color. However, the optic disc was not pale. Nine months after the surgery, his best-corrected visual acuity finally improved to 0.1. CONCLUSION: We successfully treated a case of severe vitreous hemorrhage secondary to leukemia therapy and tumor lysis syndrome using 25-gauge vitrectomy. This procedure may be safe and effective to perform, even in children with complications.","['Kudo, Takashi', 'Suzuki, Yukihiko', 'Metoki, Tomomi', 'Nakazawa, Mitsuru']","['Kudo T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Metoki T', 'Nakazawa M']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20150127,Switzerland,Case Rep Ophthalmol,Case reports in ophthalmology,101532006,,,,PMC4327334,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/03/12 06:01,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000374088 [doi]', 'cop-0006-0034 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Ophthalmol. 2015 Jan 27;6(1):34-8. doi: 10.1159/000374088. eCollection 2015 Jan-Apr.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Pediatric surgery', 'Tumor lysis syndrome', 'Vitrectomy', 'Vitreous hemorrhage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone metastases often lead to skeletal-related events with significant morbidity and mortality. The therapy of bone metastases and osteoporosis with bisphosphonates (BPs) has been established many years ago as a standard treatment. In the adjuvant setting, cancer treatment-induced bone loss is a frequent cause of morbidity, and prevention and treatment of this condition with BPs and the monoclonal antibody denosumab are also well established. Besides postmenopausal patients, several studies including 2 larger studies by the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) have shown an increase in bone mineral density in premenopausal women. BPs as anticancer treatment are, however, still controversial because several studies yielded conflicting results, with beneficial effects only in subgroups of patients. The publication of the latest Oxford overview of prospective trials is being awaited; at the presentation of the results, a 34% relative reduction of bone metastasis and a 17% improvement in overall survival was demonstrated in the subgroup of postmenopausal patients. These results will likely lead to an incorporation of the use of BPs into routine adjuvant breast cancer treatment.","['Knauer, Michael', 'Thurlimann, Beat']","['Knauer M', 'Thurlimann B']","['Breast Center St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Breast Center St. Gallen, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Breast Care (Basel),"Breast care (Basel, Switzerland)",101254060,,,,PMC4322690,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/03/12 06:01,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000368760 [doi]', 'brc-0009-0319 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Care (Basel). 2014 Oct;9(5):319-22. doi: 10.1159/000368760.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adjuvant therapy', 'Bisphosphonates', 'Bone health', 'Breast neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emerging roles of HDACs in DNA repair provide new opportunities for improving traditional genotoxic drugs. Here, we report the development and characterization of CY190602, a novel bendamustine-derived drug with significantly enhanced anticancer potency. We show that CY190602's enhanced potency can be attributed to its newly gained ability to inhibit HDACs. Using this novel DNA/HDAC dual-targeting drug as a tool, we further explored HDAC's role in DNA repair. We found that HDAC activities are essential for the expression of several genes involved in DNA synthesis and repair, including TYMS, Tip60, CBP, EP300, and MSL1. Importantly, CY190602, the first-in-class example of such DNA/HDAC dual-targeting drugs, exhibited significantly enhanced anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide rationales for incorporating HDAC inhibitory moieties into genotoxic drugs, so as to overcome the repair capacity of cancer cells. Systematic development of similar DNA/HDAC dual-targeting drugs may represent a novel opportunity for improving cancer therapy.","['Liu, Chuan', 'Ding, Hongyu', 'Li, Xiaoxi', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Hong, Liya', 'Guo, Dianwu', 'Chen, Yi', 'Wang, Difei', 'Wang, Wei', 'Wang, Yajie', 'Hemann, Michael T', 'Jiang, Hai']","['Liu C', 'Ding H', 'Li X', 'Pallasch CP', 'Hong L', 'Guo D', 'Chen Y', 'Wang D', 'Wang W', 'Wang Y', 'Hemann MT', 'Jiang H']","['Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China Department of Oncology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Clinic for Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Hangzhou Minsheng Pharma Research Institute Ltd, Hangzhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Minsheng Pharma Research Institute Ltd, Hangzhou, China.', 'Crystal Biopharmaceutical LLC, Pleasanton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China yajiewa0459@163.com hemann@mit.edu hai@sibcb.ac.cn.', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA yajiewa0459@163.com hemann@mit.edu hai@sibcb.ac.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China yajiewa0459@163.com hemann@mit.edu hai@sibcb.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice']",PMC4403045,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['emmm.201404580 [pii]', '10.15252/emmm.201404580 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2015 Apr;7(4):438-49. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201404580.,['(c) 2015 The Authors.

This study is also aimed to estimate the number of already cured cancer patients, whose mortality rates have become undistinguishable from that of the general population of the same age and sex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study took advantage of the information from the AIRTUM database, which included 29 Cancer Registries (covering 21 million people, 35% of the Italian population). A total of 1,624,533 cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2009 contributed to the study. For each registry, the observed prevalence was calculated. Prevalence for lengths of time exceeding the maximum duration of the registration and of the complete prevalence were derived by applying an estimated correction factor, the completeness index. This index was estimated by means of statistical regression models using cancer incidence and survival data available in registries with 18 years of observation or more. For 50 types or combinations of neoplasms, complete prevalence was estimated at 1.1.2010 as an absolute number and as a proportion per 100,000 inhabitants by sex, age group, area of residence, and years since diagnosis. Projections of complete prevalence for 1.1.2015 were computed under the assumption of a linear trend of the complete prevalence observed until 2010. Validated mixture cure models were used to estimate: the cure fraction, that is the proportion of patients who, starting from the time of diagnosis, are expected to reach the same mortality rate of the general population; the conditional relative survival (CRS), that is the cumulative probability of surviving some additional years, given that patients already survived a certain number of years; the time to cure, that is the number of years necessary so that conditional survival in the following five years (5-year CRS) exceeds the conventional threshold of 95% (i.e., mortality rates in cancer patients become undistinguishable compared to those of the general population); the proportion of patients already cured, i.e., people alive since a number of years exceeding time to cure. RESULTS: As of 1.1.2010, it was estimated that 2,587,347 people were alive after a cancer diagnosis, corresponding to 4.4% of the Italian population. A relevant geographical heterogeneity emerged, with a prevalence above 5% in northern registries and below 4% in southern areas. Men were 45% of the total (1,154,289) and women 55% (1,433,058). In the population aged 75 years or more, the proportions of prevalent cases were 20% in males and 13% in females, 11% between 60 and 74 years of age in both sexes. Nearly 600,000 Italian women were alive after a breast cancer diagnosis (41% of all women with this neoplasm), followed by women with cancers of the colon rectum (12%), corpus uteri (7%), and thyroid (6%). In men, 26% of prevalent cases (295,624) were patients with prostate cancer, 16% with either bladder or colon rectum cancer. The projections for 1.1.2015 are of three million (3,036,741) people alive after a cancer diagnosis, 4.9% of the Italian population; with a 20% increase for males and 15% for females, compared to 2010. The cure fractions were heterogeneous according to cancer type and age. Estimates obtained as the sum of cure fractions for all cancer types showed that more than 60% of patients diagnosed below the age of 45 years will reach the same mortality rate of the general population. This proportion decreased with increasing age and it was <30% for cancer diagnosed after the age of 74 years. It was observed that 60% of all prevalent cases (1,543,531 people or 2.6% of overall Italian population) had been diagnosed >5 years earlier (long-term survivors). Time to cure (5-year CRS>95%) was reached in <10 years by patients with cancers of the stomach, colon rectum, pancreas, corpus and cervix uteri, brain, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality rates similar to the ones reported by the general population were reached after approximately 20 years for breast and prostate cancer patients. Five-year CRS remained <95% for >25 years after cancer diagnosis in patients with liver and larynx cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia. Time to cure was reached by 27% (20% in men and 33% in women) of all people living after a cancer diagnosis, defined as already cured. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a steady increase over time (nearly +3% per year) of prevalent cases in Italy. A quarter of Italian cancer patients alive in 2010 can be considered as already cured. The AIRTUM Report 2014 describes characteristics of cancer patients and former-patients for 50 cancer types or combinations by sex and age. This detailed information promotes the conduction of studies aimed at expanding the current knowledge on the quality of life of these patients during and after the active phase of treatments (prevalence according to health status), on the long-term effects of treatments (in particular for paediatric patients), on the cost profile of cancer patients, and on rare tumours. All these observations have a high potential impact on health planning, clinical practice, and, most of all, patients' perspective.",,,,"['eng', 'ita']",['Journal Article'],,Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['materiali/2014/EP2014_I6S1_001.pdf [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2014 Nov-Dec;38(6 Suppl 1):1-122.,,,,,,,,,,['Epidemiol Prev. 2016 Jan-Feb;40(1):76.

While absent in the majority of ALL cases, tonic pre-BCR signaling was found in 112 cases (13.5%). In these cases, tonic pre-BCR signaling induced activation of BCL6, which in turn increased pre-BCR signaling output at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, inhibition of pre-BCR-related tyrosine kinases reduced constitutive BCL6 expression and selectively killed patient-derived pre-BCR(+) ALL cells. These findings identify a genetically and phenotypically distinct subset of human ALL that critically depends on tonic pre-BCR signaling. In vivo treatment studies suggested that pre-BCR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are useful for the treatment of patients with pre-BCR(+) ALL.","['Geng, Huimin', 'Hurtz, Christian', 'Lenz, Kyle B', 'Chen, Zhengshan', 'Baumjohann, Dirk', 'Thompson, Sarah', 'Goloviznina, Natalya A', 'Chen, Wei-Yi', 'Huan, Jianya', 'LaTocha, Dorian', 'Ballabio, Erica', 'Xiao, Gang', 'Lee, Jae-Woong', 'Deucher, Anne', 'Qi, Zhongxia', 'Park, Eugene', 'Huang, Chuanxin', 'Nahar, Rahul', 'Kweon, Soo-Mi', 'Shojaee, Seyedmehdi', 'Chan, Lai N', 'Yu, Jingwei', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Bijl, Janetta J', 'Ye, B Hilda', 'Ansel, K Mark', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Kurre, Peter', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Milne, Thomas A', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Geng H', 'Hurtz C', 'Lenz KB', 'Chen Z', 'Baumjohann D', 'Thompson S', 'Goloviznina NA', 'Chen WY', 'Huan J', 'LaTocha D', 'Ballabio E', 'Xiao G', 'Lee JW', 'Deucher A', 'Qi Z', 'Park E', 'Huang C', 'Nahar R', 'Kweon SM', 'Shojaee S', 'Chan LN', 'Yu J', 'Kornblau SM', 'Bijl JJ', 'Ye BH', 'Ansel KM', 'Paietta E', 'Melnick A', 'Hunger SP', 'Kurre P', 'Tyner JW', 'Loh ML', 'Roeder RG', 'Druker BJ', 'Burger JA', 'Milne TA', 'Chang BH', 'Muschen M']","['Departments of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA;

Its main side effect is a dose-related, length-dependent (LD) axonal neuropathy. METHODS: We performed electrodiagnostic (EDx) examinations in 17 children who had been treated with vincristine and who presented with the clinical picture of a peripheral neuropathy. RESULTS: The mean dose of vincristine was 8.5 +/- 4.0 mg/m(2) . Clinical motor symptoms were more frequent and more severe than sensory ones. Thirteen children presented with a motor deficit, 4 of whom could no longer walk. EDx examination showed an axonal neuropathy with a non-length-dependent (NLD) pattern in 9 children and an LD pattern in 8. A major motor predominance was encountered in 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The electrophysiological and clinical motor predominance described differs from the mainly sensory neuropathy reported in adults. Incomplete myelination due to young age may have resulted in greater sensitivity of some nerves to neurotoxic agents.","['Courtemanche, Helene', 'Magot, Armelle', 'Ollivier, Yolaine', 'Rialland, Fanny', 'Leclair-Visonneau, Laurene', 'Fayet, Guillemette', 'Camdessanche, Jean-Philippe', 'Pereon, Yann']","['Courtemanche H', 'Magot A', 'Ollivier Y', 'Rialland F', 'Leclair-Visonneau L', 'Fayet G', 'Camdessanche JP', 'Pereon Y']","[""Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44093, Nantes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44093, Nantes, France."", 'Centre de Reference Maladies Neuromusculaires Nantes Angers, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44093, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Pediatrique, Hopital Mere-Enfant, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44093, Nantes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44093, Nantes, France."", 'Service de Neurologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44093, Nantes, France."", 'Centre de Reference Maladies Neuromusculaires Nantes Angers, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150912,United States,Muscle Nerve,Muscle & nerve,7803146,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromyography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neural Conduction/physiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mus.24647 [doi]'],ppublish,Muscle Nerve. 2015 Dec;52(6):981-5. doi: 10.1002/mus.24647.

Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the frequency and potential pathogenetic role of MCPyV in CLL. The aim of this study was to evaluate MCPyV's association with CLL and its prognostic significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2013, DNA samples obtained from CLL patients (n = 119) before treatment were tested for MCPyV using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and verified by gel electrophoresis. Only samples testing positive by both methods were considered valid. RESULTS: We found that 13 (11%) of 119 CLL cases were positive for MCPyV. Between the groups of MCPyV-positive and -negative patients, there was no significant difference in the sex, age, cytogenetics, presence of p53 defect, or immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) mutational status. In the subset of MCPyV-negative patients, advanced Rai stage (III to IV) was found more frequently, and therapy was initiated more often. There was no difference in overall response rate, median progression-free survival, and overall survival between both groups. We did not observe any new positivity after treatment in initially MCPyV-negative patients. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first analysis of the prognostic role of MCPyV in CLL. MCPyV occurrence seems to be a relatively rare event during the course of CLL. MCPyV is also unlikely to influence the outcome of CLL patients.","['Trizuljak, Jakub', 'Srovnal, Josef', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Semerad, Lukas', 'Bakesova, Denisa', 'Letalova, Eva', 'Benedikova, Andrea', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Hajduch, Marian', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Doubek, Michael']","['Trizuljak J', 'Srovnal J', 'Plevova K', 'Brychtova Y', 'Semerad L', 'Bakesova D', 'Letalova E', 'Benedikova A', 'Mayer J', 'Hajduch M', 'Pospisilova S', 'Doubek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, and Faculty Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, and Faculty Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.

RESULTS: Ninety-six physicians (19%) responded-89% in community practice, 83% with more than 10 years of experience, and 92% caring for CML patients. Eighty-four percent self-reported using CML monitoring guidelines, 14% were familiar with but did not adopt guidelines and 2% were unfamiliar. Eighty-four percent performed molecular monitoring quarterly as recommended; 6% did not perform molecular monitoring at all during the first year. Guidelines were considered evidence based by 98%, but only 54% strongly considered them easy to find; only 51% strongly felt they addressed all aspects of disease management. Patient resource barriers were a significant deterrent toward implementation with 30% citing high costs. Physician resources, including lack of time to search guidelines, limited use in one fifth. Despite 90% believing an online database helpful, between one third and one half did not feel that additional training, professional society endorsements, or availability of expert consultations would encourage use. CONCLUSIONS: Significant barriers to adherence with evidence-based CML guidelines exist. Resource barriers, lack of familiarity and lack of agreement restrict adoption, but efforts to facilitate use are not desired. Multifaceted educational strategies, including automated computerized reminders at point of care, are needed to improve quality outcomes in CML.","['Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Akard, Luke P', 'Dugan, Michael J', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Pecora, Andrew L']","['Goldberg SL', 'Akard LP', 'Dugan MJ', 'Faderl S', 'Pecora AL']","['John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ; and Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, St Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, IN sgoldberg@hackensackumc.org.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ; and Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, St Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, IN.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ; and Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, St Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, IN.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ; and Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, St Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, IN.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ; and Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, St Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, IN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20150310,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Access to Information', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Drug Monitoring/standards/trends', '*Evidence-Based Medicine/standards/trends', '*Guideline Adherence/standards/trends', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Indiana', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Medication Adherence', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/standards/trends', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'New Jersey', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards/trends"", 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JOP.2014.001099 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2014.001099 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2015 May;11(3):e398-404. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2014.001099.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenylter-trazolium bromide tetrazolium (MTT) assay was adopted to examine cytotoxicity of different treatments. Nuclear morphology changes were observed under a fluorescence microscopy with 4'-6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of caspase-3, Beclin 1 (BECN 1) and the conversion of LC3- phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate/a cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3 II/I). Fluorescence microscope was used to identify the formation of autophagic vacuoles (AVO) during autophagy. RESULTS: Under optimal conditions, SDT was shown to induce autophagy in K562 cells, which caused the up-regulation of Beclin-1 and the formation of AVO. In addition, pre-treatment of cancer cells with Beclin 1-targeted short hairpin RNA (Beclin 1 shRNA) was shown to reduce the level of LC3-II accumulation and staining with punctate spots of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. Besides, the cytotoxic effect of SDT was significantly increased by Beclin 1 shRNA. Furthermore, studies showed a marked effect on the apoptosis of cells by Beclin 1 shRNA to sonodamage with increased DAPI staining and caspase-3 cleavage. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that SDT significantly induced autophagy of K562 cells, probably to protect the K562 cells from sonodamage.","['Su, Xiaomin', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Liu, Quanhong', 'Wang, Pan', 'Xu, Chuanshan', 'Leung, Albert Wingnang']","['Su X', 'Wang X', 'Liu Q', 'Wang P', 'Xu C', 'Leung AW']","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an, Shaanxi , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150318,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Autophagy/genetics', 'Beclin-1', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Photosensitizing Agents/therapeutic use', 'Protoporphyrins/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Ultrasonic Therapy/*methods', 'Vacuoles/pathology']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2015.1021961 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2015 Jun;91(6):472-9. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2015.1021961.

B cell-Hodgkin lymphomas are the more frequent cancer, followed by non-Hodgkin lymphoma and epithelial tumors (gastric, breast, bladder and cervix). OBJECTIVE: To describe the types of cancers in a cohort of adult patients with CVID. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study was made in which we reviewed the charts of patients with CVID attending the Primary Immunodeficiencies Clinic at Specialties Hospital Dr. Bernardo Sepulveda, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Mexico City. RESULTS: There were included 23 patients with CVID diagnosis, 13 women (56%) and 10 men (44%), with an average age of 36.7 years. Four patients developed malignancies (2 men and 2 women), with a prevalence of 17.3%. The types of cancers in this group of patients were: B cell-Hodgkin lymphoma (1/23), neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas (1/23), myeloid chronic leukemia (1/23) and thyroid papillary carcinoma (1/23). In two of the subjects the diagnosis of cancer was established previous to CVID diagnosis. The average age of diagnosis of cancer was 27 years (19-34 years). CONCLUSIONS: In our patients we found different types of malignancies compared to previously described. We consider necessary a screening protocol for an early diagnosis of cancer in these patients. The frequency of cancer in our population was the same as reported in the literature.","['Lopez-Rocha, Eunice', 'Rodriguez-Mireles, Karen', 'Segura-Mendez, Nora Hilda', 'Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco Antonio']","['Lopez-Rocha E', 'Rodriguez-Mireles K', 'Segura-Mendez NH', 'Yamazaki-Nakashimada MA']","['Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Distrito Federal, Mexico. aeri_05@hotmail.com.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Mexico,Rev Alerg Mex,"Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)",9438824,,IM,,,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/03/12 06:01,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Alerg Mex. 2015 Jan-Mar;62(1):22-7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Common variable immunodeficiency patients', 'Lymphoma', 'Neoplasm']",,,,,,Prevalencia de cancer en pacientes adultos con inmunodeficiencia comun variable.,,,,,,,,

The outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for patients with this disease remains unknown. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the efficacy of allo-HSCT in eight adult MLL-ELL-positive AML patients. Although all eight patients achieved first complete remission (CR1), three (37.5 %) patients experienced relapse after induction therapy. Five (62.5 %) patients underwent allo-HSCT during CR1, whereas two (25.0 %) underwent allo-HSCT during disease relapse, and one (12.5 %) during CR2. All three patients who received allo-HSCT beyond CR1 died due to AML progression after allo-HSCT. Of the five patients who received allo-HSCT during CR1, three (60.0 %) remained alive at study conclusion. The overall survival rate at five years was 50.0 %. Intriguingly, clonally expanded non-leukemic cells expressing MLL-ELL during consolidation therapy were found to be eradicated after allo-HSCT during the monitoring of minimal residual disease in one patient; this indicates that allo-HSCT is efficacious for eliminating pre-leukemic cells resistant to chemotherapy. In conclusion, allo-HSCT soon after CR1 represents a promising therapeutic option for adult AML patients with MLL-ELL, although the outcome of allo-HSCT for patients beyond CR1 was dismal.","['Muto, Tomoya', 'Takeuchi, Masahiro', 'Yamazaki, Atsuko', 'Sugita, Yasumasa', 'Tsukamoto, Shokichi', 'Sakai, Shio', 'Takeda, Yusuke', 'Mimura, Naoya', 'Ohwada, Chikako', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Aotsuka, Nobuyuki', 'Iseki, Tohru', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki']","['Muto T', 'Takeuchi M', 'Yamazaki A', 'Sugita Y', 'Tsukamoto S', 'Sakai S', 'Takeda Y', 'Mimura N', 'Ohwada C', 'Sakaida E', 'Aotsuka N', 'Iseki T', 'Nakaseko C']","['Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, 260-8670, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150311,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (MLL-ELL fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1779-z [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jul;102(1):86-92. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1779-z.

Recent studies have indicated that the addition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may increase the sensitivity of malignant cells to ATO. The aim of the present study was to test for possible synergistic effects of ATO and rapamycin at therapeutically achievable doses in non-APL AML cells. In HL-60 and U937 cell lines, the inhibitory effects of low concentrations of ATO and rapamycin were synergistic and more pronounced in U937 cells. The combination of drugs increased apoptosis in HL-60 cells and increased the percentage of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase in both cell lines. In U937 cells, rapamycin alone increased the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and the addition of ATO decreased the level of phosphorylated ERK, Ser473 phosphorylated Akt and anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Primary AML cells show high sensitivity to growth-inhibitory effects of rapamycin alone or in combination with ATO. The results of the present study reveal the mechanism of the synergistic effects of two drugs at therapeutically achievable doses in non-APL AML cells.","['Dembitz, Vilma', 'Lalic, Hrvoje', 'Ostojic, Alen', 'Vrhovac, Radovan', 'Banfic, Hrvoje', 'Visnjic, Dora']","['Dembitz V', 'Lalic H', 'Ostojic A', 'Vrhovac R', 'Banfic H', 'Visnjic D']","['Department of Physiology and Croatian Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Salata 3, POB 978, 10 000, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150311,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1776-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jul;102(1):12-24. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1776-2.

Distinguishing MDS from other cytopenias is sometimes difficult even for trained hematologists. WT1, the gene mutated in Wilms' tumor, was found expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and MDS. The amount of WT1 in peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) is low in low-risk MDS subtypes, and is high in high-risk MDS subtypes. However, the role of WT1 in the differential diagnosis between MDS and other diseases showing cytopenia has not been fully addressed. The present study evaluated whether WT1 expression level can assist in the differential diagnosis of MDS from other cytopenias. METHODS: The amount of WT1 message was evaluated among 56 MDS patients and 47 patients with cytopenia for various other reasons (cytopenia VR) at the Nagasaki University Hospital. RESULTS: The level of WT1 was significantly related to the percentage of blasts in BM among MDS cases, and the type of French-American-British classification of MDS; refractory anemia (RA) cases showed significantly lower WT1 level than patients with RA with excess blasts. WT1 level was significantly related to the prognostic risk categories of MDS by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the revised IPSS. Although the blast percentage in the BM of RA and cytopenia VR were both less than 5%, there was a significant difference in the level of WT1 between MDS and cytopenia VR. CONCLUSION: WT1 might be a good marker to differentiate low blast percentage MDS and cytopenia VR.","['Baba, Maki', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Tsushima, Hideki', 'Mori, Sayaka', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Turuta, Kazuto', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Ando, Koji', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Baba M', 'Hata T', 'Tsushima H', 'Mori S', 'Sasaki D', 'Turuta K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Ando K', 'Sawayama Y', 'Imanishi D', 'Taguchi J', 'Yanagihara K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamihira S', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Unit of Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150115,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Myoblasts/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.54.3123 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2015;54(5):445-51. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.3123.

However, the fact that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including IM, are extremely expensive is a major cause of poor adherence, resulting in disease relapse or drug resistance. Therefore, physicians are encouraged to prescribe generic drugs to reduce the financial burden of medical expenses. In Japan, only generic drugs that have a basic chemical structure and pharmacokinetic data that are the same as those of the original drug are approved. However, it is not mandatory to demonstrate that generic drugs have adequate biological effects. This is one of the reasons why Japanese hematologists do not often use generic IM. The aim of the present study was to compare the anti-leukemic effects of Glivec (a commercial IM) and its generic formulation, OHK9511. The IC50 values of OHK9511 and Glivec were comparable, and both induced similar levels of apoptosis in several CML cell lines. Furthermore, the overall survival of OHK9511-treated mice transplanted with BCR-ABL-positive cells was similar to that of mice treated with Glivec.

The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence of SMs after a diagnosis of WM with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: With SEER-13 data (1992-2011), standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the rates of solid and hematologic SMs in WM patients versus the general population. The analysis was stratified by age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, and latency from the WM diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 4676 patients with WM, 681 SMs were recorded. The overall SIR was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.38-1.61), and the median time to an SM was 3.7 years. The cumulative incidence of SMs was 10% at 5 years and 16% at 10 years. The risk was significantly increased for cancers of the lungs, urinary tract, and thyroid; melanoma; aggressive lymphoma; and acute leukemia. The SIR for SMs in patients with WM was increased, regardless of age, sex, race, or year of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WM had a 49% higher risk of SMs than the general population. The selectively increased risk for hematologic SMs and certain solid SMs may be associated with transformation, therapy, and immune dysregulation.","['Castillo, Jorge J', 'Olszewski, Adam J', 'Hunter, Zachary R', 'Kanan, Sandra', 'Meid, Kirsten', 'Treon, Steven P']","['Castillo JJ', 'Olszewski AJ', 'Hunter ZR', 'Kanan S', 'Meid K', 'Treon SP']","['Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Pawtucket, Rhode Island.', 'Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150310,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*epidemiology']",,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/09/01 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2015/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29334 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jul 1;121(13):2230-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29334.

When the disease becomes symptomatic or progressive, chemotherapy with fludarabine in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (FCR) is recommended as standard therapy, except for patients with relevant comorbidity or with del(17p13) oder TP53 mutation. We predict the number of prevalent CLL patients in 2011-2020 who need first-line therapy but are ineligible for FCR treatment. The input parameters of the Markov model are the estimated total CLL incidence (based on German cancer registry data) and clinical data on disease progression and patient characteristics (obtained by a systematic literature research). Plausibility ranges for the estimation of the total CLL incidence are given by the following: (1) inclusion of small lymphocytic lymphoma and (2) an alternative handling of death-certificate-only cases. The number of patients ineligible for FCR treatment increases from approximately 1200 in 2011 to approximately 1450 in 2020. The inclusion of small lymphocytic lymphoma cases results in 10% higher estimates, the alternative handling of death-certificate-only cases in 8% lower estimates. Recently, several new and targeted agents have been approved for CLL patients ineligible for standard treatment. Estimation of patient numbers is a prerequisite for planning of health care and for calculating the costs of treatment.

This study evaluated the pro-apoptotic effect of an anthocyanin-rich dietary bilberry extract (Antho 50) on B CLL cells from 30 patients and on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy subjects, and determined the underlying mechanism. Antho 50 induced concentration- and time-dependent pro-apoptotic effects in B CLL cells but little or no effect in PBMCs. Among the main phenolic compounds of the bilberry extract, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside induced a pro-apoptotic effect. Antho 50-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase 3, down-regulation of UHRF1, a rapid dephosphorylation of Akt and Bad, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Antho 50 significantly induced PEG-catalase-sensitive formation of reactive oxygen species in B CLL cells. PEG-catalase prevented the Antho 50-induced induction of apoptosis and related signaling. The present findings indicate that Antho 50 exhibits strong pro-apoptotic activity through redox-sensitive caspase 3 activation-related mechanism in B CLL cells involving dysregulation of the Bad/Bcl-2 pathway. This activity of Antho 50 involves the glucoside and rutinoside derivatives of delphinidin. They further suggest that Antho 50 has chemotherapeutic potential by targeting selectively B CLL cells.","['Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Leon-Gonzalez, Antonio J', 'Dandache, Israa', 'Lelay, Agnes', 'Rashid, Sherzad K', 'Kevers, Claire', 'Pincemail, Joel', 'Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Mauvieux, Laurent', 'Herbrecht, Raoul', 'Schini-Kerth, Valerie B']","['Alhosin M', 'Leon-Gonzalez AJ', 'Dandache I', 'Lelay A', 'Rashid SK', 'Kevers C', 'Pincemail J', 'Fornecker LM', 'Mauvieux L', 'Herbrecht R', 'Schini-Kerth VB']","['CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74, route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74, route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74, route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.', '1] CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74, route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France [2] Oncologie et Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Avenue Moliere, 67100 Strasbourg, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74, route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.', 'University of Liege, Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Unit, B22, Sart Tilman, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Dept. of Cardiovascular Surgery and CREDEC, Pathology Tower B23, Sart Tilman, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.', '1] Oncologie et Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Avenue Moliere, 67100 Strasbourg, France [2] Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Medecine, Strasbourg, France.', ""1] Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Medecine, Strasbourg, France [2] Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Avenue Moliere, 67100 Strasbourg, France."", '1] Oncologie et Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Avenue Moliere, 67100 Strasbourg, France [2] Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Medecine, Strasbourg, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74, route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150311,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '474A9U89JS (delphinidin 3-O-glucopyranoside)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthocyanins/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Glucosides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Vaccinium myrtillus/*chemistry', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*metabolism']",PMC4355738,2015/03/12 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08996 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08996 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Mar 11;5:8996. doi: 10.1038/srep08996.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we introduce two-dimensional (2D) metal oxides to tackle this biological separation issue. A nanocomposite composed of titanoniobate nanosheets embedded with Fe(3)O(4) nanocrystals (Fe(3)O(4)-TiNbNS) is constructed via a facile cation-exchange approach, and adopted for the capture and isotope labeling of phosphopeptides. In this nanoarchitecture, the 2D titanoniobate nanosheets offer enlarged surface area and a spacious microenvironment for capturing phosphopeptides, while the Fe(3)O(4) nanocrystals not only incorporate a magnetic response into the composite but, more importantly, also disrupt the restacking process between the titanoniobate nanosheets and thus preserve a greater specific surface for binding phosphopeptides. Owing to the extended active surface, abundant Lewis acid sites and excellent magnetic controllability, Fe(3)O(4)-TiNbNS demonstrates superior sensitivity, selectivity and capacity over homogeneous bulk metal oxides, layered oxides, and even restacked nanosheets in phosphopeptide enrichment, and further allows in situ isotope labeling to quantify aberrantly-regulated phosphopeptides from sera of leukemia patients. This composite nanosheet greatly contributes to the MS analysis of phosphopeptides and gives inspiration in the pursuit of 2D structured materials for separation of other biological molecules of interests.","['Chen, Xueqin', 'Li, Siyuan', 'Zhang, Xiaoxia', 'Min, Qianhao', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie']","['Chen X', 'Li S', 'Zhang X', 'Min Q', 'Zhu JJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, P.

Previous studies have indicated that lower TCRzeta levels are a common characteristic of patients with leukemia, and upregulating TCRzeta could partially recover T cell function. In this study, we characterized the effect of the stimulating factor induction on the TCRzeta, Zap-70, and FcvarepsilonRIgamma levels, IFN-gamma secretion, and the distribution and clonal expansion of TCR Vbeta subfamilies in CD3(+) T cells sorted from peripheral blood from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The induction included single stimulating factor or a combination with different cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-2+IL-7, IL-7+IL-12, CD3, CD3+CD28 antibody, CD3+CD28 antibody+IL-2, and CD3+CD28 antibody+IL-7) at 72 h. The results showed that increased TCRzeta and Zap-70 levels with deceased FcvarepsilonRIgamma in T cells after induction, and different responses to cytokine in T cell from different cases may indicate the heterogeneity of T cells and different immune statuses in different AML cases. Increased IFN-gamma levels in T cells from AML patients were detected after induction in the IL-12+IL-7, CD3+CD28+IL-2, and CD3+CD28+IL-7 groups. Moreover, the number of TCR Vbeta subfamily T cells expressed was increased; however, all of the TCR Vbeta subfamily T cells in the AML patients could not be completely recovered after induction. In conclusion, the cytotoxicity and activation function of T cells could be enhanced after induction by different stimuli accompanied by an increase in TCRzeta and Zap-70 and recovery of the TCR Vbeta repertoire in AML patients.","['Shi, Li', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Xu, Yan', 'Xu, Ling', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Zhu, Kanger', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Shi L', 'Chen S', 'Zha X', 'Xu Y', 'Xu L', 'Yang L', 'Lu Y', 'Zhu K', 'Li Y']","['1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '2 Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '3 Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '4 Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '4 Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '1 Institute of Hematology, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .', '3 Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150310,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",PMC4504257,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/10/02 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2015.2810 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2015 Jul;34(7):481-8. doi: 10.1089/dna.2015.2810.

In this study we found that expression of Aven correlates inversely with metastasis-free survival in osteosarcoma patients and is increased in metastases compared to primary tumours. Aven is an adaptor protein that has been implicated in anti-apoptotic signalling and serves as an oncoprotein in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In osteosarcoma cells, silencing Aven triggered G2 cell-cycle arrest; Chk1 protein levels were attenuated and ATR-Chk1 DNA damage response signalling in response to chemotherapy was abolished in Aven-depleted osteosarcoma cells, while ATM, Chk2 and p53 activation remained intact. Osteosarcoma is notoriously difficult to treat with standard chemotherapy, and we examined whether pharmacological inhibition of the Aven-controlled ATR-Chk1 response could sensitize osteosarcoma cells to genotoxic compounds. Indeed, pharmacological inhibitors targeting Chk1/Chk2 or those selective for Chk1 synergized with standard chemotherapy in 2D cultures. Likewise, in 3D extracellular matrix-embedded cultures, Chk1 inhibition led to effective sensitization to chemotherapy. Together, these findings implicate Aven in ATR-Chk1 signalling and point towards Chk1 inhibition as a strategy to sensitize human osteosarcomas to chemotherapy.","['Baranski, Zuzanna', 'Booij, Tijmen H', 'Cleton-Jansen, Anne-Marie', 'Price, Leo S', 'van de Water, Bob', 'Bovee, Judith V M G', 'Hogendoorn, Pancras C W', 'Danen, Erik H J']","['Baranski Z', 'Booij TH', 'Cleton-Jansen AM', 'Price LS', 'van de Water B', 'Bovee JV', 'Hogendoorn PC', 'Danen EH']","['Division of Toxicology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Toxicology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), The Netherlands.', 'Division of Toxicology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, The Netherlands.', 'OcellO B.V.

Indications for colostomy were nonhealing wounds, and ceaseless pain. RESULTS: All patients showed a rapid reduction of pain. Complete wound healing was seen in 2 patients, and considerable pain reduction and increased quality of life were seen in a third patient during palliative care.

As a result, in 2006 the Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology Progress Review Group convened and examined the factors that impact the care of the 70,000 new cases per year (approximately 7% of all new cases) in the United States and published their findings. The reasons for inferior survival gains are of course multiple and include the settings in which patients are cared for, clinical trial enrollment, insurance coverage, varied treatment of sarcomas, varied treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the psychosocial impact of cancer and cancer survivorship. A new area of a yet-to-be completely defined subspecialty was born out of this meeting: AYA oncology. As a medical community we realized that these patients do not fit neatly into the pediatric nor adult world and, therefore, require a unique approach which many individuals, oncology centers, advocacy groups, and cooperative trial groups have started to address. This group of dedicated providers and advocates has made strides but there is still much work to be done on the local, national, and international level to make up for shortcomings in the medical system and improve outcomes. We review key components of AYA cancer care in 2015 that all providers should be aware of, how far we have come, where this movement is headed, and the obstacles that continue to stand in the way of better cure rates and quality of life after cure for this unique group of patients. Like an adolescent maturing into adulthood, this movement has learned from the past and is focused on moving into the future to achieve its goals.","['Shaw, Peter H', 'Reed, Damon R', 'Yeager, Nicholas', 'Zebrack, Bradley', 'Castellino, Sharon M', 'Bleyer, Archie']","['Shaw PH', 'Reed DR', 'Yeager N', 'Zebrack B', 'Castellino SM', 'Bleyer A']","[""*Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA daggerSarcoma Program, H.

Bromodomain- and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multidomain histone binder and a master activator of three lysine acetyltransferases, MOZ, MORF and HBO1, which are also known as KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7, respectively. While the MOZ and MORF genes are rearranged in leukemia, the MORF gene is also mutated in prostate and other cancers and in four genetic disorders with intellectual disability. Here we show that forebrain-specific inactivation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes hypoplasia in the dentate gyrus, including underdevelopment of the suprapyramidal blade and complete loss of the infrapyramidal blade. We trace the developmental origin to compromised Sox2+ neural stem cells and Tbr2+ intermediate neuronal progenitors. We further demonstrate that Brpf1 loss deregulates neuronal migration, cell cycle progression and transcriptional control, thereby causing abnormal morphogenesis of the hippocampus. These results link histone binding and acetylation control to hippocampus development and identify an important epigenetic regulator for patterning the dentate gyrus, a brain structure critical for learning, memory and adult neurogenesis.","['You, Linya', 'Yan, Kezhi', 'Zou, Jinfeng', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Bertos, Nicholas R', 'Park, Morag', 'Wang, Edwin', 'Yang, Xiang-Jiao']","['You L', 'Yan K', 'Zou J', 'Zhao H', 'Bertos NR', 'Park M', 'Wang E', 'Yang XJ']","['The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150310,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BRPF1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eomes protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6B protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (MOZ protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dentate Gyrus/growth & development/*metabolism/pathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Hippocampus/growth & development/pathology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Morphogenesis/*genetics', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Prosencephalon/embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics']",PMC4355587,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/12/25 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1005034 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-13-03434 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2015 Mar 10;11(3):e1005034. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005034. eCollection 2015 Mar.,,,,,,,,,,"['PLoS Genet. 2015 Jun;11(6):e1005329.

Riceberry that had demonstrated anti-cancer activity in leukemic cell line were investigated. After saponification with potassium hydroxide, separation of the unsaponified fraction by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resulted in four sub-fractions that had a certain degree of anti-proliferation against a mouse leukemic cell line (WEHI-3 cell), this being IC50 at 24 h ranging between 2.80-467.11 mug/mL. Further purification of the bioactive substances contained in these four sub-fractions was performed by normal-phase HPLC. Structural characterization by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) resulted in, overall, the structures of seven phytosterols and four triterpenoids.

To examine the involvement of AT2R expression in human PDAC, expressions of AT2R as well as the major angiotensin II receptor (type 1 receptor, AT1R) in human PDAC and adjacent normal tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and real time PCR using surgically dissected human PDAC specimens. In immunohistochemical analysis, relatively strong AT1R expression was detected consistently in both normal pancreas and PDAC areas, whereas moderate AT2R expression was detected in 78.5% of PDAC specimens and 100% of normal area of the pancreas. AT1R, but not AT2R, mRNA levels were significantly higher in the PDAC area than in the normal pancreas. AT2R mRNA levels showed a negative correlation trend with overall survival. In cell cultures, treatment with a novel AT2R agonist significantly attenuated both murine and human PDAC cell growth with negligible cytotoxicity in normal epithelial cells. In a mouse study, administrations of the AT2R agonist in tumor surrounding connective tissue markedly attenuated growth of only AT2R expressing PAN02 murine PDAC grafts in syngeneic mice. The AT2R agonist treatment induced apoptosis primarily in tumor cells but not in stromal cells. Taken together, our findings offer clinical and preclinical evidence for the involvement of AT2R signaling in PDAC development and pinpoint that the novel AT2R agonist could serve as an effective therapeutic for PDAC treatment.","['Ishiguro, Susumu', 'Yoshimura, Kiyoshi', 'Tsunedomi, Ryouichi', 'Oka, Masaaki', 'Takao, Sonshin', 'Inui, Makoto', 'Kawabata, Atsushi', 'Wall, Terrahn', 'Magafa, Vassiliki', 'Cordopatis, Paul', 'Tzakos, Andreas G', 'Tamura, Masaaki']","['Ishiguro S', 'Yoshimura K', 'Tsunedomi R', 'Oka M', 'Takao S', 'Inui M', 'Kawabata A', 'Wall T', 'Magafa V', 'Cordopatis P', 'Tzakos AG', 'Tamura M']","['a Department of Anatomy and Physiology ; Kansas State University ; Manhattan , KS USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1)', '0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', 'Pancreatic Carcinoma']",IM,"['Angiotensin II/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2/agonists/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",PMC4623015,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2014.1002357 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(2):307-16. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2014.1002357.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor', 'AT2R, angiotensin II type 2 receptor', 'Ad-, adenoviral vector', 'Ang II, angiotensin II', 'BSA, bovine serum albumin', 'DMEM, Dulbecco`s modification of Eagle`s medium', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'GFP, green fluorescent protein', ""HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution"", 'HIF-1, hypoxia inducible factor', 'Ki, association constant', 'PCR, polymerase chain reaction', 'PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase', 'PLZF, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein', 'TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling', 'VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor', 'angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R)', 'apoptosis', 'cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'selective AT2R agonist']","['5P20RR015563/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016475/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017686/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

High affinity Mcl(-)1 inhibitors currently do not exist such that novel methods to inhibit Mcl(-)1 clinically are in high demand. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) regulate Mcl(-)1 in many cancers and play a role in NB survival, yet how they regulate Bcl(-)2 family interactions in NB is unknown. We found that NB cell lines derived to resist the Bcl(-)2/-xl/-w antagonist, ABT-737, acquire a dependence on Mcl(-)1 and show increased expression and activation of the RTK, EGFR. Mcl(-)1 dependent NB cell lines derived at diagnosis and from the same tumor following relapse also have increased EGFR expression compared to those dependent on Bcl(-)2. Inhibition of EGFR by shRNA or erlotinib in Mcl(-)1 dependent NBs disrupts Bim binding to Mcl(-)1 and enhances its affinity for Bcl(-)2, restoring sensitivity to ABT-737 as well as cytotoxics in vitro. Mechanistically treatment of NBs with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR (erlotinib, cetuximab) and ERK (U0126) increases Noxa expression and dephosphorylates Bim to promote Bim binding to Bcl(-)2. Thus, EGFR regulates Mcl(-)1 dependence in high-risk NB via ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Bim such that EGFR/ERK inhibition renders Mcl(-)1 dependent tumors now reliant on Bcl(-)2. Clinically, EGFR inhibitors are ineffective as single agent compounds in patients with recurrent NB, likely due to this transferred survival dependence to Bcl(-)2. Likewise, EGFR or ERK inhibitors warrant further testing in combination with Bcl(-)2 antagonists in vivo as a novel future combination to overcome therapy resistance in the clinic.","['Nalluri, Srilatha', 'Peirce, Susan K', 'Tanos, Rachel', 'Abdella, Haneen A', 'Karmali, Dipan', 'Hogarty, Michael D', 'Goldsmith, Kelly C']","['Nalluri S', 'Peirce SK', 'Tanos R', 'Abdella HA', 'Karmali D', 'Hogarty MD', 'Goldsmith KC']","[""a Division of Hematology/Oncology; Aflac Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center ; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta ; Atlanta , GA USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",PMC4622539,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2014.1002333 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(2):276-86. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2014.1002333.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'AKT, protein kinase B', 'BH3, Bcl-2 homology domain 3', 'Bcl-2 antagonist', 'Bcl-2 homology proteins', 'Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2', 'EGFR', 'EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor', 'ERK, extracellular signal related kinase', 'HR NB, high-risk neuroblastoma', 'LPP, lambda protein phosphatase', 'Mcl-1', 'Mcl-1, Myeloid cell leukemia-1', 'NB, neuroblastoma', 'RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase', 'TK, tyrosine kinase', 'WCL, whole cell lysate', 'apoptosis', 'bim regulation', 'co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation']",['K08-CA128925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanisms of AS by analyzing microarray of GSE25101. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: AS is an inflammatory arthritis that can lead to chronic pain and disability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GSE25101 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus including 16 AS patients and 16 normal controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using limma package in Bioconductor and miRNAs targeted DEGs were predicted. Then, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Besides, the interaction relationships of the proteins encoded by DEGs were searched by STRING, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized by Cytoscape. Moreover, modules analysis of PPI network was performed using Clique Percolation Method in CFinder. RESULTS: A total of 284 DEGs were screened and 1899 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs were obtained. Both myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) were targeted by has-miR-124 and has-miR-363. Function enrichment analyze indicated that these DEGs, especially, downregulated protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type C (PTPRC), cluster of differentiation 3gamma (CD3G), cluster of differentiation 247 (CD247), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R), MYH9, and BCL11B were associated with regulation of immune response. Meanwhile, CD4 (degree=25), perforin 1 (PRF1) (degree=15), PTPRC (degree=13), and CD247 (degree=9) had higher connectivity degrees in the PPI network for the DEGs. And they might be involved in AS by interacting with other genes in module B (eg, PTPRC-IL7R, CD3G-CD247, and PRF1-PTPRC). CONCLUSION: MYH9, BCL11B, PTPRC, CD3G, CD247, CD4, IL7R, and PRF1 might have a correlation with AS.","['Shi, Zhicai', 'Li, Quan', 'Cai, Bin', 'Ran, Bo', 'Li, Ming']","['Shi Z', 'Li Q', 'Cai B', 'Ran B', 'Li M']","['Department of Orthopedics, Changhai Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",,United States,J Spinal Disord Tech,Journal of spinal disorders & techniques,101140323,,,,,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/03/11 06:01,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/BSD.0000000000000266 [doi]'],ppublish,J Spinal Disord Tech. 2015 May;28(4):E244-50. doi: 10.1097/BSD.0000000000000266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Spinal Disord Tech. 2015 May;28(4):E250.

Patient 1 was a 78-year-old man with chemotherapy-resistant inguinal bulky mass. Radiotherapy (total 40 Gy) for this inguinal lesion was started; however, the bulky disease was found to be resistant to radiotherapy and progressed. VP-16 and CPT-11 were administered in addition to radiotherapy (after a total of 20 Gy of radiotherapy). Patient 2 was a 71-year-old man with a solitary bulky mass in left cervical lesion. Various previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy approaches had not been able to control the disease. Six months after first radiotherapy, the bulky disease rapidly progressed with the occurrence of pain. Second radiotherapy (30 Gy) was started with simultaneous administration of CPT-11 and VP-16. In both cases, the bulky disease gradually regressed and completely disappeared by the end of radiotherapy.

METHODS: We performed immunophenotyping for expressions of the molecules in blood samples from children diagnosed with ALL by using a panel of monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometry analysis. The expression of markers was evaluated in relation to clinical and paraclinical features as well as response to treatment in the patients. Findings : CD95 showed a higher expression in T-ALL compared to B-ALL (P<0.001). Analysis of the clinical and laboratory findings at diagnosis in the group of B-ALL patients revealed an association between CD95 expression with lower white blood cell (WBC) numbers and bone marrow blasts (P<0.05). We detected a positive correlation between the expressions of CD95 and CD44 (r=0.445, P<0.01) in B-ALL patients. There was an association between CD20 expression and several poor prognostic factors that included increased extramedullary involvement (EMI) and decreased platelet numbers (P<0.008). The mean expression of CD34 in B-ALL was higher than T-ALL (P=0.004). At follow-up, complete remission duration (CRD) and survival duration did not significantly differ between patients who were positive or negative for each marker. CONCLUSION: Association of the studied molecules with several prognostic factors implies the significance of CD95 molecule as favorable and CD20 as unfavorable prognostic markers for childhood ALL.","['M Kamazani, Fatemeh', 'Bahoush-Mehdiabadi, Gholamreza', 'Aghaeipour, Mahnaz', 'Vaeli, Shahram', 'Amirghofran, Zahra']","['M Kamazani F', 'Bahoush-Mehdiabadi G', 'Aghaeipour M', 'Vaeli S', 'Amirghofran Z']","['Department of Immunology, Autoimmune Disease Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz.', 'Onco-Pathology Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences.', 'Research Center of Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Center of Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Autoimmune Disease Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140521,Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,PMC4339559,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/03/11 06:01,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2014 Aug;24(4):371-80.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the protein of JARID1B and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), and cyclin D1 and Ki67 in 30 cases of MCL by immunohistochemistry. JARID1B was depleted by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and cell apoptosis and cell proliferation were detected by flow cytometry and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], histone tri-methylated H3K4 and histone acetylated H3, H4, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, procaspase-3, C-myc were studied by Western blot. RESULTS: We demonstrated that JARID1B was upregulated and histone tri-methylated H3K4 was downregulated in MCL compared to proliferative lymphadenitis, P < 0.05. The expression of histone methylated H3K9 was similar in both. Histone methylation of H3K4 was positively correlated with Ki67 in MCL (Kappa = 0.757, P < 0.05). This study showed that depletion of JARID1B cleavage apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2, procaspase-3, C-myc and resulted in loss cell viability and inducing apoptosis in Jeko-1 and HL-60 cell lines. JARID1B siRNA improved tri-methyl H3K4 and histone acetylated H3 and inhibited cyclin D1, but did not affect histone acetylated H4. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed hyper JARID1B expression and hypo histone H3K4 tri-methylation in MCL. We identify depletion JARID1B as a demethylase which is capable of removing three methyl groups from H3K4 and up-regulating histone acetylation of H3 in both cell lines. Interestingly, depletion of JARID1B inhibits Cyclin D1, which is one of the genes contributes to MCL pathogenesis. JARID1B might be one of therapeutic targets in acute leukemia and MCL.","['Su, Haiyan', 'Ma, Xudong', 'Huang, Yiqun', 'Han, Huidan', 'Zou, Yong', 'Huang, Wenhua']","['Su H', 'Ma X', 'Huang Y', 'Han H', 'Zou Y', 'Huang W']","['Department of Pathology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150101,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM5B protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transfection']",PMC4348832,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2015 Jan 1;8(1):171-83. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['JARID1B', 'MCL', 'acute leukemia', 'histone methylation', 'siRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOS, also known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD), occurs as a result of cytoreductive therapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), following oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver and treated by partial hepatectomy, in patients taking pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing herbal remedies, and in other particular settings such as the autosomal recessive condition of veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI). A central pathogenic event is toxic destruction of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC), with sloughing and downstream occlusion of terminal hepatic venules. Contributing factors are SEC glutathione depletion, nitric oxide depletion, increased intrahepatic expression of matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and activation of clotting factors. The clinical presentation of SOS includes jaundice, development of right upper-quadrant pain and tender hepatomegaly, ascites, and unexplained weight gain. Owing to the potentially critical condition of these patients, transjugular biopsy may be the preferred route for liver biopsy to exclude other potential causes of liver dysfunction and to establish a diagnosis of SOS. Treatment includes rigorous fluid management so as to avoid excessive fluid overload while avoiding too rapid diuresis or pericentesis, potential use of pharmaceutics such as defibrotide, coagulolytic agents, or methylprednisolone, and liver transplantation. Proposed strategies for prevention and prophylaxis include reduced-intensity conditioning radiation for HSCT, treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, and inclusion of bevacizumab with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimes. While significant progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of SOS and in mitigating against its adverse outcomes, this condition remains a serious complication of a selective group of medical treatments.","['Fan, Cathy Q', 'Crawford, James M']","['Fan CQ', 'Crawford JM']","['Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141030,India,J Clin Exp Hepatol,Journal of clinical and experimental hepatology,101574137,,,,PMC4298625,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/03/11 06:01,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jceh.2014.10.002 [doi]', 'S0973-6883(14)00422-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hepatol. 2014 Dec;4(4):332-46. doi: 10.1016/j.jceh.2014.10.002.

Reduced expression of the corresponding genes can lead to an impaired DNA damage repair mechanism. Intracellular replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in such conditions can favor the integration of viral DNA into host genome leading to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to assess the expression of HMGB1 and PARP1 mRNAs in conjunction with the estimation of HBV replication intermediate pregenomic RNA (PgRNA) in various phases of HBV infection. MATERIALS: Eighty eight patients and 26 voluntary blood donors as controls were included in the study. Patients were grouped in to acute (AHB; n = 15), inactive carriers (IC; n = 36), cirrhosis (Cirr; n = 25) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 12). Serum HBV DNA was quantified by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Expression of HMGB1, PARP1 and PgRNA were evaluated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and densitometry. RESULTS: Significant reduction of HMGB1 and PARP1 gene expressions (P < 0.05) were observed in patients than controls with more explicit decline of PARP1 (P = 0.0002). Both genes were significantly downregulated (P < 0.001) in ICs than controls. In ICs, HMGB1 was significantly lowered than cirrhosis (P = 0.002) and HCC (P = 0.0006) while PARP1 declined significantly (P = 0.04) than HCC. Level of PgRNA was comparable in all the disease categories. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings indicate impaired DNA damage repair mechanisms in HBV infected cells of ICs. This, along with low viral load but higher level of PgRNA in this group is suggestive of the diversion of HBV replication pathway that might facilitate viral DNA integration in to host genome. Intrusion of HBV PgRNA reverse transcription in early stage of infection might appear advantageous to thwart the development of HCC.","['Mukherjee, Rathindra M', 'Shravanti, Gelli V', 'Jakkampudi, Aparna', 'Kota, Ramya', 'Jangala, Asha L', 'Reddy, Panyala B', 'Rao, Padaki N', 'Gupta, Rajesh', 'Reddy, Duvvuru N']","['Mukherjee RM', 'Shravanti GV', 'Jakkampudi A', 'Kota R', 'Jangala AL', 'Reddy PB', 'Rao PN', 'Gupta R', 'Reddy DN']","['Asian Health Care Foundation, Institute of Basic and Translational Research, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082, India.', 'Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, India.', 'Asian Health Care Foundation, Institute of Basic and Translational Research, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082, India.', 'Asian Health Care Foundation, Institute of Basic and Translational Research, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082, India.', 'Asian Health Care Foundation, Institute of Basic and Translational Research, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082, India.', 'Asian Health Care Foundation, Institute of Basic and Translational Research, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082, India.', 'Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, India.', 'Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, India.', 'Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130522,India,J Clin Exp Hepatol,Journal of clinical and experimental hepatology,101574137,,,,PMC3940113,2013/06/01 00:00,2013/06/01 00:01,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jceh.2013.04.003 [doi]', 'S0973-6883(13)00545-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hepatol. 2013 Jun;3(2):89-95. doi: 10.1016/j.jceh.2013.04.003.

We showed previously that it was safe to add nelarabine to a BFM-86 chemotherapy backbone (AALL00P2). Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL0434 is a Phase III study designed to test the safety and efficacy of nelarabine when incorporated into a COG augmented BFM-based regimen, which increases exposure to agents with potential neurotoxicity compared to the historical AALL00P2 regimen. PROCEDURE: AALL0434 included a safety phase to assess nelarabine toxicity. Patients with high-risk (HR) T-ALL were randomized to receive Capizzi-style escalating methotrexate (MTX) plus pegaspargase or high dose (HD) MTX with/without six five-days courses of nelarabine. We report results from 94 patients who participated in the initial safety phase of the study. RESULTS: There were no differences in the incidence of peripheral motor neuropathies, sensory neuropathies or central neurotoxicities among those randomized to the nelarabine (n = 47) and non-nelarabine arms (n = 47). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of nelarabine to COG-augmented BFM chemotherapy regimen is safe and feasible. The ongoing AALL0434 Efficacy Phase will determine whether the addition of nelarabine treatment improves outcome for patients with T-ALL.","['Winter, Stuart S', 'Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Eisenberg, Nancy', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Leonard Rn, Marcia S', 'Murphy, John', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Winter SS', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Devidas M', 'Eisenberg N', 'Asselin BL', 'Wood BL', 'Leonard Rn MS', 'Murphy J', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Loh ML', 'Raetz EA', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP']","['University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', ""University of Virginia Children's Hospital, Charlottesville, Virginia."", 'Biostatistics, the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Western Australia."", ""C S Mott Children's Hospital, Ann Arbor, Michigan."", 'Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'UCSF Medical Center - Parnassus, San Francisco, California.', ""University of Utah, Primary Children's Hospita, Salt Lake City."", 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150308,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides', 'Asparaginase', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC4433576,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25470 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jul;62(7):1176-83. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25470.

PROCEDURE: The AIEOP LNH-97 trial was run between 1997 and 2007 for newly diagnosed LBL in patients aged less than 18 years. Treatment schedule was based on the previous, LSA2-L2 derived, AIEOP LNH-92 protocol. Modifications included: increased dose of upfront cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, use of l-Asparaginase during induction therapy, intensive block therapy for slow responders, and late intensification (""Reinduction"") for patients with advanced stage disease. Total therapy duration was 12 months for stage I and II, and 24 months for stage III and IV. Central nervous system prophylaxis did not include cranial irradiation. RESULTS: 114 eligible patients were enrolled, 84 males and 30 females; median age was 9 years. Complete remission was obtained in 98% of patients. After a median follow-up time of seven years, 29 patients failed due to progression of disease (n = 2), relapse (n = 25), or second malignancy (n = 2). The 7-year overall survival was 82% (standard error [SE] 4%) and the 7-year event-free survival was 74% (SE 4%). No subgroup showed significantly different event free survival. None of the patients died of front line chemotherapy-related toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment intensification was associated with good outcome in children and adolescents with LBL, with limited toxicity. Prognosis after relapse was better for patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Measurements of biological markers and treatment response are necessary for achieving further improvement through more accurate identification and stratification of patients at risk of disease relapse.","['Pillon, Marta', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Mussolin, Lara', 'Carraro, Elisa', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Sala, Alessandra', 'Buffardi, Salvatore', 'Garaventa, Alberto', ""D'Angelo, Paolo"", 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Piglione, Matilde', 'Lombardi, Alessandra', 'Porta, Fulvio', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Moleti, Maria L', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Mura, Rossella', ""d'Amore, Emanuele S G"", 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Rosolen, Angelo']","['Pillon M', 'Arico M', 'Mussolin L', 'Carraro E', 'Conter V', 'Sala A', 'Buffardi S', 'Garaventa A', ""D'Angelo P"", 'Lo Nigro L', 'Santoro N', 'Piglione M', 'Lombardi A', 'Porta F', 'Cesaro S', 'Moleti ML', 'Casale F', 'Mura R', ""d'Amore ES"", 'Basso G', 'Rosolen A']","[""Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Azienda Sanitaria Provinciale, Ragusa, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Fondazione Citt, a, della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', ""Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Azienda Ospedaliera San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Azienda Ospedaliera San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Santobono-Pausilipon Hospital of Napoli, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, A.R.N.A.S.

PROCEDURE: We performed a decision analysis using a Markov model in which we compared the life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy when administering one of three CRT strategies to a cohort of patients with T-cell ALL: (1) omission of CRT for all patients; (2) CRT only for those with evidence of leukemic involvement in the central nervous system at diagnosis (therapeutic strategy); or (3) CRT for all (prophylactic strategy). RESULTS: When considering plausible event-free survival rates and late mortality after cure for groups of pediatric patients with T-cell ALL, the strategies of omitting CRT, administering therapeutic CRT, and administering prophylactic CRT result in similar short-term (7-year) survival. When considering the increased contribution of deaths from late effects, the strategy of prophylactic CRT is associated with lower life expectancy when compared to the other two strategies. The Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the strategy of prophylactic CRT was the preferred strategy only 5% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Similar short-term survival may be expected when comparing the strategies of total omission of CRT, therapeutic CRT, and prophylactic CRT for patients with T-cell ALL. Long-term survival is likely inferior for the strategy of prophylactic CRT. The synthesis of nonrandomized trials and the application of decision analysis can help inform complex decision making in pediatric oncology.","['Kelly, Michael J', 'Pauker, Stephen G', 'Parsons, Susan K']","['Kelly MJ', 'Pauker SG', 'Parsons SK']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Pediatrics, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150305,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Aged', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cranial Irradiation/*mortality', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', '*Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25451 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 May;62(5):790-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25451.

Drug concentration and infusion set influence the overall particulate contamination of pediatric infusion protocols. The use of multi-lumen infusion sets could prevent such incompatibilities. Our goal was to define and assess a new way to infuse these drugs during leukemia treatment in children. PROCEDURES: This in vitro study focused on a pediatric multidrug protocol for patients diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia and receiving allogeneic transplantation. Different vancomycin concentrations were tested to infuse incompatible drugs simultaneously without any particle formation (optimized multidrug protocol). A dynamic particle count test was used over 24 hr to evaluate the overall particulate contamination of our standard and optimized multidrug protocols, using both a standard and a multi-lumen infusion set. RESULTS: No visible particles were detected on a decreased vancomycin concentration compared to the standard dose. For the optimized multidrug protocol, the use of a multi-lumen infusion set reduced overall particulate contamination by 68%, compared to the standard infusion set (P = 0.002). Large-sized particles were significantly reduced when using the multi-lumen infusion set approximately 60% (P = 0.027) and 90% (P = 0.009) for particle sizes >/=10 mum and 25 mum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a large number of particles can be administered during parenteral multidrug infusion. The choice of drug concentration and/or the type of infusion set may reduce this. Further studies are required to evaluate adverse clinical effects.","['Perez, Maxime', 'Decaudin, Bertrand', 'Abou Chahla, Wadih', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Barthelemy, Christine', 'Lebuffe, Gilles', 'Odou, Pascal']","['Perez M', 'Decaudin B', 'Abou Chahla W', 'Nelken B', 'Barthelemy C', 'Lebuffe G', 'Odou P']","['EA GRITA, University Lille Nord de France, Lille, France; Institute of Pharmacy, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150308,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['*Drug Contamination', '*Drug Incompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Particle Size', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25442 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):1042-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25442.

After dose level 1, the schedule was changed to daily (Monday-Friday) for 10 days. Twenty-two patients were treated. The most common possibly related toxicities were infusion reaction, anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenia, neutropenia, rash) at dose levels 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Eight patients had stable disease, with no objective responses. The serum half-life of milatuzumab was approximately 2 h. In seven patients, In-111 imaging showed no clear evidence of tumor targeting.

Despite this progress, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children in the United States, and significant short-term and long-term treatment toxicities continue to impact the majority of children with cancer. The development of targeted new agents offers the prospect of potentially more effective and less toxic treatment for children. More than a decade since imatinib mesylate was introduced into the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, transforming its outcome, a range of targeted agents has undergone study in pediatric cancer patients. Early lessons learned from these studies include a better understanding of the adverse event profile of these drugs in children, the challenge of developing pediatric-specific formulations, and the continued reliance on successful development for adult cancer indications on pediatric drug development. The collaborative research infrastructure for children with cancer in the United States is well positioned to advance novel treatments into clinical investigations for a spectrum of rare and ultra-rare childhood cancers. A greater investment of resources in target discovery and validation can help drive much needed development of new, more effective treatments for children with cancer.","['Adamson, Peter C']",['Adamson PC'],"[""Chair, Children's Oncology Group, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150309,United States,CA Cancer J Clin,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,0370647,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Child', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug and Narcotic Control', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",PMC4629487,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3322/caac.21273 [doi]'],ppublish,CA Cancer J Clin. 2015 May-Jun;65(3):212-20. doi: 10.3322/caac.21273.

Elucidation of acquired resistance mechanisms and development of strategies to overcome the resistance are critical for their successful clinical development. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We employed RS4;11 and MV4;11 cell lines, two acute leukemia models, to investigate acquired resistance mechanisms for both drugs in vitro and in vivo and evaluated several treatment regimens in xenograft mouse models to improve long-term, complete tumor regression. RESULTS: Resistance to either SAR405838 or ABT-263 (or its analogue ABT-737) develops in acute leukemia models in vitro and in vivo. RS4;11 and MV4;11 tumors treated with SAR405838 acquire resistance to the drug by mutation of the TP53 gene or compromise of p53 protein function. RS4;11 tumors treated with either ABT-263 or ABT-737 acquire resistance primarily through downregulation of BAX but not BAK. When acute leukemia cells become highly resistant to the MDM2 inhibitor, they retain their sensitivity to the Bcl-2 inhibitors, or vice versa. Certain sequential or combination treatment of SAR405838 and ABT-263 can achieve longer-term tumor regression than treatment with either agent alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of acquired resistance of Bcl-2 and MDM2 inhibitors in acute leukemia models and suggests that certain sequential or combination treatment of these two distinct classes of apoptosis-inducing agents should be tested as new treatment strategies for acute leukemia in the clinic.","['Hoffman-Luca, C Gianna', 'Ziazadeh, Daniel', 'McEachern, Donna', 'Zhao, Yujun', 'Sun, Wei', 'Debussche, Laurent', 'Wang, Shaomeng']","['Hoffman-Luca CG', 'Ziazadeh D', 'McEachern D', 'Zhao Y', 'Sun W', 'Debussche L', 'Wang S']","['University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Various chemokines play a role in tumor proliferation and invasion, and chemokine receptors including the C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) are recognized as potential targets for treating hematologic malignancies. The aim of the present study was to determine whether specific chemokines are produced by NNKTL. We compared chemokine expression patterns in culture supernatants of NNKTL cell lines with those of other lymphoma or leukemia cell lines using chemokine protein array and ELISA. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 17 and CCL22 were highly produced by NNKTL cell lines as compared to the other cell lines. In addition, CCL17 and CCL22 were readily observed in the sera of NNKTL patients. The levels of these chemokines were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. Furthermore, we detected the expression of CCR4 (the receptor for CCL17 and CCL22) on the surface of NNKTL cell lines and in tissues of NNKTL patients. Anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) efficiently induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer cells against NNKTL cell lines. Our results suggest that CCL17 and CCL22 may be important factors in the development of NNKTL and open up the possibility of immunotherapy of this lymphoma using anti-CCR4 mAb.","['Kumai, Takumi', 'Nagato, Toshihiro', 'Kobayashi, Hiroya', 'Komabayashi, Yuki', 'Ueda, Seigo', 'Kishibe, Kan', 'Ohkuri, Takayuki', 'Takahara, Miki', 'Celis, Esteban', 'Harabuchi, Yasuaki']","['Kumai T', 'Nagato T', 'Kobayashi H', 'Komabayashi Y', 'Ueda S', 'Kishibe K', 'Ohkuri T', 'Takahara M', 'Celis E', 'Harabuchi Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Asahikawa Medical University, Midorigaoka-Higashi 2-1-1-1, Asahikawa, 078-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150310,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (CCL17 protein, human)', '0 (CCL22 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Chemokine CCL22)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)']",IM,"['Chemokine CCL17/*immunology', 'Chemokine CCL22/*immunology', 'Chemokines', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Receptors, CCR4/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4648286,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-015-1675-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2015 Jun;64(6):697-705. doi: 10.1007/s00262-015-1675-7.

Further analysis revealed an association of low CIg with 12 gene probes implicated in cell cycle regulation, differentiation and drug transportation from which a risk score was developed in TT3b that held prognostic significance also in TT3a, TT2 and HOVON trials, thus validating its general applicability. Low CIg is a powerful new prognostic variable and has identified potentially drug-able targets.","['Papanikolaou, X', 'Alapat, D', 'Rosenthal, A', 'Stein, C', 'Epstein, J', 'Owens, R', 'Yaccoby, S', 'Johnson, S', 'Bailey, C', 'Heuck, C', 'Tian, E', 'Joiner, A', 'van Rhee, F', 'Khan, R', 'Zangari, M', 'Jethava, Y', 'Waheed, S', 'Davies, F', 'Morgan, G', 'Barlogie, B']","['Papanikolaou X', 'Alapat D', 'Rosenthal A', 'Stein C', 'Epstein J', 'Owens R', 'Yaccoby S', 'Johnson S', 'Bailey C', 'Heuck C', 'Tian E', 'Joiner A', 'van Rhee F', 'Khan R', 'Zangari M', 'Jethava Y', 'Waheed S', 'Davies F', 'Morgan G', 'Barlogie B']","['Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Cancer Research and Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150310,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",PMC4530205,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201565 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.65 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1713-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.65.

The BM microenvironment rich in hematopoietic precursors is suspected to have a role in MM development. Here we show that a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) mediated in vivo MM promotion. In MM-infiltrated BM, APRIL originated from differentiating myeloid cells with an expression peak in precursor cells. Notably, APRIL expression stayed stable in BM despite MM infiltration. The pool of APRIL-producing cells changed upon MM infiltration. Although CD16(+) mature myeloid cells constituted about half of the APRIL-producing cells in healthy BM, CD16(-) Elastase(+) myeloid precursor cells were predominant in MM-infiltrated BM. Myeloid precursor cells secreted all the APRIL they produced, and binding of secreted APRIL to MM cells, strictly dependent of heparan sulfate carried by CD138, resulted in an in situ internalization by tumor cells. This indicated APRIL consumption by MM in BM. Taken together, our data show that myelopoiesis dysregulation characterized by an increased proportion of precursor cells occurs in MM patients. Such dysregulation correlates with a stable expression of the MM-promoting factor APRIL in infiltrated BM.","['Matthes, T', 'McKee, T', 'Dunand-Sauthier, I', 'Manfroi, B', 'Park, S', 'Passweg, J', 'Huard, B']","['Matthes T', 'McKee T', 'Dunand-Sauthier I', 'Manfroi B', 'Park S', 'Passweg J', 'Huard B']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology, Medicine Faculty, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology-Immunology, Medicine Faculty, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Analytical Immunology of Chronic Pathologies, INSERMU823/University Joseph Fourier, Albert Bonniot Institute, La Tronche, France.', 'Hematology, University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Analytical Immunology of Chronic Pathologies, INSERMU823/University Joseph Fourier, Albert Bonniot Institute, La Tronche, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150310,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/genetics/*metabolism']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201568 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1901-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.68.

Its importance is underlined by the fact that deregulation of IKAROS results in leukaemia in both mice and men. During recent years, constitutional as well as acquired genetic changes of IKZF1 have been associated with human disease. For example, certain germline single nucleotide polymorphisms in IKZF1 have been shown to increase the risk of some disorders and abnormal expression and somatic rearrangements, mutations and deletions of IKZF1 (DeltaIKZF1) have been detected in a wide variety of human malignancies. Of immediate clinical importance is the fact that DeltaIKZF1 occurs in 15% of paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP ALL) and that the presence of DeltaIKZF1 is associated with an increased risk of relapse and a poor outcome; in some studies such deletions have been shown to be an independent risk factor also when minimal residual disease data are taken into account. However, cooperative genetic changes, such as ERG deletions and CRLF2 rearrangements, may modify the prognostic impact of DeltaIKZF1, for better or worse.

METHODS: aCT was performed at diagnosis in 181 Rai 0 patients enrolled in the O-CLL1-GISL trial (clinicaltrial.gov ID:NCT00917549). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients showed an abnormal aCT. Patients with an abnormal aCT showed a significantly shorter TTFT than those with normal aCT (P < 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, aCT (P = 0.011), beta-2 microglobulin (P = 0.019), and CD38 expression (P = 0.047) correlated with TTFT. Following IWCLL 2008 criteria, 112 (61.9%) cases remained at Rai 0, while 69 (38.1%) satisfied the criteria of clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (cMBL). Reclassified Rai 0 patients with an abnormal aCT showed a significantly shorter TTFT than those with a normal aCT (P < 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, only aCT (P = 0.011) correlated with TTFT. Eleven cMBL cases (15.9%) showed an abnormal aCT and were reclassified as small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL); nonetheless, TTFT was similar for cMBLs and SLLs.

Records for animals used in the control groups of carcinogenicity studies which were conducted during the last 10 years were obtained from the database of the Japan Bioassay Research Center (JBRC). Six hundred ninety-nine males and 550 females were used in 14 and 11 inhalation studies, respectively, and 500 animals of each sex were used in 10 male and 10 female oral studies. METHODS: In each study, SPF (specific pathogen free) animals were housed for 2 years (104 weeks) as control groups in the carcinogenicity studies. All animals underwent necropsy and histopathological examination. Each study was conducted in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice. RESULTS: The incidence of interstitial cell tumors was highest in both inhalation studies and oral studies (inhalation studies 86.1%, oral studies 68.6%). Tumors which had an incidence of 6% or higher were adenoma of the pituitary, C-cell adenoma of the thyroid, and mononuclear cell leukemia (LGL leukemia) of the spleen in male and female rats; fibroma of the subcutaneous tissue, adrenal pheochromocytoma, and islet cell adenoma of the pancreas in male rats; and endometrial stromal polyps and fibroadenoma of the mammary gland in female rats. Tumors other than the above had rare incidence rates. A clear difference in the incidence of spontaneous tumors was not observed between the inhalation and oral studies. The incidences of spontaneous tumors in control groups of previous oral studies are similar to our findings. There are no other reports of the spontaneous tumor incidence in the control groups of inhalation studies using F344/DuCrlCrlj rats. The 2-year survival rate was about 77% in both the inhalation and oral studies, and a gender difference was not observed. The F344/DuCrlCrlj rats used at JBRC had a higher 2-year survival rate than F344/N rats. This difference is possibly due to the low incidence of LGL leukemia in the F344/DuCrlCrlj rat. CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of spontaneous tumors in F344/DuCrlCrlj rats used in control groups of both inhalation and oral studies during the last 10 years at JBRC are similar to each other and similar to those reported in other studies. This is the first report on the incidence of spontaneous tumors in inhalation studies and contributes to the toxicological evaluation of studies using F344/DuCrlCrlj rats.","['Takanobu, Kenji', 'Aiso, Shigetoshi', 'Umeda, Yumi', 'Senoh, Hideki', 'Saito, Misae', 'Katagiri, Taku', 'Ikawa, Naoki', 'Ishikawa, Hiroaki', 'Mine, Takashi', 'Take, Makoto', 'Haresaku, Mitsuru', 'Matsumoto, Michiharu', 'Fukushima, Shoji']","['Takanobu K', 'Aiso S', 'Umeda Y', 'Senoh H', 'Saito M', 'Katagiri T', 'Ikawa N', 'Ishikawa H', 'Mine T', 'Take M', 'Haresaku M', 'Matsumoto M', 'Fukushima S']","['Japan Bioassay Research Center, Japan Industrial Safety and Health Association, 2445, Hirasawa, Hadano, Kanagawa 257-0015, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20150309,Japan,Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi,Sangyo eiseigaku zasshi = Journal of occupational health,9507473,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Animals, Laboratory', '*Carcinogenicity Tests/methods', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rodent Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2016/03/18 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1539/sangyoeisei.E14006 [doi]'],ppublish,Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi. 2015;57(3):85-96. doi: 10.1539/sangyoeisei.E14006.

Thus, in the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of GBA was investigated mainly in H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells because H460 cells were most susceptible to GBA than A549, PC-9 and HCC827 NSCLC cells. Galbanic acid showed cytotoxicity in wild EGFR type H460 and A549 cells better than other mutant type PC-9 and HCC827 NSCLC cells. Also, GBA significantly increased the number of Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells and sub G1 population in H460 cells. Western blotting revealed that GBA cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated Bax and caspase 9, attenuated the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) in H460 cells. However, interestingly, overexpression of Mcl-1 blocked the ability of GBA to exert cytotoxicity, activate caspase9 and Bax, cleave PARP, and increase sub G1 accumulation in H460 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that GBA induces apoptosis in H460 cells via caspase activation and Mcl-1 inhibition in H460 cells as a potent anticancer agent for NSCLC treatment.","['Oh, Bum-Seok', 'Shin, Eun Ah', 'Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Jung, Deok-Beom', 'Kim, Bonglee', 'Shim, Bum Sang', 'Yazdi, Mahsa Chitsazian', 'Iranshahi, Mehrdad', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Oh BS', 'Shin EA', 'Jung JH', 'Jung DB', 'Kim B', 'Shim BS', 'Yazdi MC', 'Iranshahi M', 'Kim SH']","['College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashad, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashad, Iran.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 131-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150306,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '9OFS0HWC92 (galbanic acid)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'Ferula/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5320 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2015 Jun;29(6):844-9. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5320.

In children, the disease involves mostly the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis; CM), whereas in adults, the disease is usually systemic (systemic mastocytosis; SM). Advanced SM variants with end-organ damage and reduced life expectancy have also been described, but are rare. Clinical signs and symptoms in SM result from excessive mediator release by MCs and, in aggressive forms, from organ failure related to MC infiltration. As a consequence, treatment of indolent SM aims primarily at the control of symptoms caused by MC mediator release. By contrast, in advanced SM, such as aggressive SM, MC leukemia, and MC sarcoma, intensive (chemo)therapy with or without allogeneic stem cell transplantation has to be considered. In addition, activating mutations in KIT (mostly KIT D816V in adults) are found in most patients with SM, so that targeted therapies aimed at blocking mutant KIT variants or/and downstream signaling pathways are currently being developed. Other targets, such as specific surface antigens expressed on neoplastic MCs, might be considered for the development of future therapies in advanced SM.","['Arock, Michel', 'Akin, Cem', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Valent, Peter']","['Arock M', 'Akin C', 'Hermine O', 'Valent P']","['Molecular Oncology and Pharmacology, LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', ""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Clinical Hematology Department, Faculty of Medicine and AP-HP Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Imagine Institute, INSERM U1168, CNRS ERL 8654, National Reference Center on Mastocytosis, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150326,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12544 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):474-90. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12544.

Here we identify FOXM1 as a candidate responsible for an aggressive clinical course. We show that FOXM1 levels peak at the pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint but are dispensable for normal B-cell development. Compared with normal B-cell populations, FOXM1 levels are 2- to 60-fold higher in ALL cells and are predictive of poor outcome in ALL patients. FOXM1 is negatively regulated by FOXO3A, supports cell survival, drug resistance, colony formation and proliferation in vitro, and promotes leukemogenesis in vivo. Two complementary approaches of pharmacological FOXM1 inhibition-(i) FOXM1 transcriptional inactivation using the thiazole antibiotic thiostrepton and (ii) an FOXM1 inhibiting ARF-derived peptide-recapitulate the findings of genetic FOXM1 deletion. Taken together, our data identify FOXM1 as a novel therapeutic target, and demonstrate feasibility of FOXM1 inhibition in ALL.","['Buchner, Maike', 'Park, Eugene', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Klemm, Lars', 'Flach, Johanna', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Schjerven, Hilde', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Kopanja, Dragana', 'Raychaudhuri, Pradip', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Buchner M', 'Park E', 'Geng H', 'Klemm L', 'Flach J', 'Passegue E', 'Schjerven H', 'Melnick A', 'Paietta E', 'Kopanja D', 'Raychaudhuri P', 'Muschen M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', '1] Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA [2] Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 OAH, UK.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Hem/Onc Division, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Hem/Onc Division, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10021, USA.', 'Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10466, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.', '1] Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA [2] Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 OAH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150310,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Peptides)', 'HR4S203Y18 (Thiostrepton)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thiostrepton/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4366523,2015/03/11 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms7471 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms7471 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2015 Mar 10;6:6471. doi: 10.1038/ncomms7471.,,,,"['101880/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA175380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA175380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA177655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA169458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA139032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA137060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA157644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA172558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS668230'],,['ORCID: 0000000192873375'],,,,,,,,,,

Thus, transplantation outcomes were compared in the prospective multinational Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) study group trial: ALL-SCT-BFM 2003 (Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children and Adolescents with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). PATIENTS AND METHODS: After conditioning with total-body irradiation and etoposide, 411 children with high-risk ALL received highly standardized stem-cell transplantations during the first or later remissions. Depending on donor availability, grafts originated from HLA-genoidentical siblings or from HLA-matched unrelated donors who were identified and matched by high-resolution allelic typing and were compatible in at least 9 of 10 HLA loci. RESULTS: Four-year event-free survival (+/- standard deviation [SD]) did not differ between patients with transplantations from unrelated or sibling donors (0.67 +/- 0.03 v 0.71 +/- 0.05; P = .405), with cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality (+/- SD) of 0.10 +/- 0.02 and 0.03 +/- 0.02 (P = .017) and relapse rates (+/- SD) of 0.22 +/- 0.02 and 0.24 +/- 0.04 (P = .732), respectively. Among recipients of transplantations from unrelated donors, no significant differences in event-free survival, overall survival, or nonrelapse mortality were observed between 9/10 and 10/10 matched grafts or between peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow. The absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease had no effect on event-free survival. Engraftment was faster after bone marrow transplantation from siblings and was associated with fewer severe infections and pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: Outcome among high-risk pediatric patients with ALL after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation was not affected by donor type. Standardized myeloablative conditioning produced a low incidence of treatment-related mortality and effective control of leukemia.","['Peters, Christina', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Bader, Peter', 'Ebell, Wolfram', 'Lang, Peter', 'Sykora, Karl-Walter', 'Schrum, Johanna', 'Kremens, Bernhard', 'Ehlert, Karoline', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Matthes-Martin, Susanne', 'Gungor, Tayfun', 'Holter, Wolfgang', 'Strahm, Brigitte', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Schulz, Ansgar', 'Woessmann, Wilhelm', 'Poetschger, Ulrike', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Klingebiel, Thomas']","['Peters C', 'Schrappe M', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Schrauder A', 'Bader P', 'Ebell W', 'Lang P', 'Sykora KW', 'Schrum J', 'Kremens B', 'Ehlert K', 'Albert MH', 'Meisel R', 'Matthes-Martin S', 'Gungor T', 'Holter W', 'Strahm B', 'Gruhn B', 'Schulz A', 'Woessmann W', 'Poetschger U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Klingebiel T']","[""Christina Peters, Susanne Matthes-Martin, and Ulrike Poetschger, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria; Martin Schrappe, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel; Andre Schrauder, Kinderarztpraxis am Aalborgring, Kiel; Arend von Stackelberg and Wolfram Ebell, Charite-Children's Hospital Berlin, Berlin; Peter Bader and Thomas Klingebiel, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt; Peter Lang, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen; Karl-Walter Sykora and Martin Zimmerman, Hannover Medical School, Hannover; Johanna Schrum, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg; Bernhard Kremens, University Hospital Essen, Essen; Karoline Ehlert, University Clinic Greifswald, Greifswald; Michael H.

Recent attempts of developing safer transplantation modalities increasingly focuses on selective cell depletion and graft engineering with the aim of retaining beneficial immune donor cells for the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect. In this context, the adoptive and especially innate effector functions of gammadelta T cells together with clinical studies investigating the effect of gammadelta T cells in relation to HSCT are reviewed. In addition to phospho-antigen recognition by the gammadelta T cell receptor (TCR), gammadelta T cells express receptors of the natural killer (NK) and natural cytotoxicity (NCR) families enabling them to recognize and kill leukaemia cells. Antigen recognition independent from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allows for the theoretical possibility of mediating GVL without an allogeneic response in terms of GVHD. Early studies on the impact of gammadelta T cells in HSCT have reported conflicting results. Recent studies, however, do suggest an overall favourable effect of high gammadelta T cell immune reconstitution after HSCT; patients with elevated numbers of gammadelta T cells had a significantly higher overall survival rate and a decreased rate of acute GVHD compared to patients with low or normal gammadelta T cell counts. Further research in terms of effector mechanisms, subtypes and tissue distribution during the course of HSCT is needed to assess the potentially beneficial effects of gammadelta T cells in this setting.","['Minculescu, L', 'Sengelov, H']","['Minculescu L', 'Sengelov H']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Models, Immunological', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12289 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2015 Jun;81(6):459-68. doi: 10.1111/sji.12289.,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with CLL received 2 mg vincristine by a 5-min intravenous infusion. Blood samples were collected at baseline and up to 6 h after the vincristine infusion, and assayed for JNK activation, Noxa induction and vincristine plasma concentrations. RESULTS: Ex vivo treated peripheral CLL cells activated JNK in response to 10-100 nM vincristine in 6 h. Noxa protein expression, while variable, was also observed over this time frame. In CLL patients, vincristine infusion led to rapid (<1 h) JNK phosphorylation in peripheral blood CLL cells which was sustained for at least 4-6 h after the vincristine infusion. Noxa protein expression was not observed in response to vincristine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that vincristine can activate JNK but not induce Noxa in CLL cells in vivo. The results suggest that novel JNK-dependent drug combinations with vincristine warrant further investigation.","['Bates, Darcy J P', 'Lewis, Lionel D', 'Eastman, Alan', 'Danilov, Alexey V']","['Bates DJ', 'Lewis LD', 'Eastman A', 'Danilov AV']","['Department of Medicine.', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.', 'Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology.', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology.', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.', 'Department of Medicine.', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150519,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",PMC4574834,2015/03/11 06:00,2016/06/04 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcp.12624 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Sep;80(3):493-501. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12624.

The activity of C/EBPalpha is modulated by several serine/threonine kinases and via sumoylation, its gene is activated by RUNX1 and additional transcription factors, its mRNA stability is modified by miRNAs, and its mRNA is subject to translation control that affects AUG selection. In addition to inducing differentiation, C/EBPalpha inhibits cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Within hematopoiesis, C/EBPalpha levels increase as long-term stem cells progress to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP). Absence of C/EBPalpha prevents GMP formation, and higher levels are required for granulopoiesis compared to monopoiesis. C/EBPalpha interacts with AP-1 proteins to bind hybrid DNA elements during monopoiesis, and induction of Gfi-1, C/EBPepsilon, KLF5, and miR-223 by C/EBPalpha enables granulopoiesis. The CEBPA ORF is mutated in approximately 10 % of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), leading to expression of N-terminally truncated C/EBPalphap30 and C-terminal, in-frame C/EBPalphaLZ variants, which inhibit C/EBPalpha activities but also play additional roles during myeloid transformation. RUNX1 mutation, CEBPA promoter methylation, Trib1 or Trib2-mediated C/EBPalphap42 degradation, and signaling pathways leading to C/EBPalpha serine 21 phosphorylation reduce C/EBPalpha expression or activity in additional AML cases.","['Friedman, Alan D']",['Friedman AD'],"['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Cancer Research Building I, Room 253, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD, 21231, USA, afriedm2@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150310,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",PMC4696001,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1764-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Apr;101(4):330-41. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1764-6.

Few prognostic markers have been identified. We reviewed 192 patients with CBF AML, treated with curative intent (age, 15-79 years) in 11 Italian institutions. Overall, 10-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival were 63.9%, 54.8%, and 49.9%, respectively; patients with the t(8;21) and inv(16) chromosomal rearrangements exhibited significant differences at diagnosis. Despite similar high complete remission (CR) rate, patients with inv(16) experienced superior DFS and a high chance of achieving a second CR, often leading to prolonged OS also after relapse. We found that a complex karyotype (i.e., >/=4 cytogenetic anomalies) affected survival, even if only in univariate analysis; the KIT D816 mutation predicted worse prognosis, but only in patients with the t(8;21) rearrangement, whereas FLT3 mutations had no prognostic impact. We then observed increasingly better survival with more intense first-line therapy, in some high-risk patients including autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In multivariate analysis, age, severe thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and failure to achieve CR after induction independently predicted longer OS, whereas complex karyotype predicted shorter OS only in univariate analysis. The achievement of minimal residual disease negativity predicted better OS and DFS. Long-term survival was observed also in a minority of elderly patients who received intensive consolidation. All considered, we identified among CBF AML patients a subgroup with poorer prognosis who might benefit from more intense first-line treatment.","['Mosna, Federico', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Bonalumi, Angela', 'Tecchio, Cristina', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Capelli, Debora', 'Piccin, Andrea', 'Forghieri, Fabio', 'Bigazzi, Catia', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Zanatta, Lucia', 'Volpato, Francesca', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Gherlinzoni, Filippo', 'Gottardi, Michele']","['Mosna F', 'Papayannidis C', 'Martinelli G', 'Di Bona E', 'Bonalumi A', 'Tecchio C', 'Candoni A', 'Capelli D', 'Piccin A', 'Forghieri F', 'Bigazzi C', 'Visani G', 'Zambello R', 'Zanatta L', 'Volpato F', 'Paolini S', 'Testoni N', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Gottardi M']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Ist ""LA Seragnoli,"" University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Ist ""LA Seragnoli,"" University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Ancona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Bolzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Ascoli-Piceno, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Pesaro, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Ist ""LA Seragnoli,"" University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Ist ""LA Seragnoli,"" University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150401,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Core Binding Factors)'],IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Autografts', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factors/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24000 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jun;90(6):515-23. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24000.

Among conditions encountered in the Gulf War (GW) theater were physiological stressors (e.g., heat/cold/physical activity/sleep deprivation), prophylactic treatment with the reversible AChE inhibitor, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the insect repellent, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and potentially the nerve agent, sarin. Prior exposure to the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), at levels associated with high physiological stress, can paradoxically prime the CNS to produce a robust proinflammatory response to neurotoxicants and systemic inflammation; such neuroinflammatory effects can be associated with sickness behavior. Here, we examined whether CORT primed the CNS to mount neuroinflammatory responses to GW exposures as a potential model of GWI. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with chronic (14 days) PB/ DEET, subchronic (7-14 days) CORT, and acute exposure (day 15) to diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a sarin surrogate and irreversible AChE inhibitor. DFP alone caused marked brain-wide neuroinflammation assessed by qPCR of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, IL-1beta, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M. Pre-treatment with high physiological levels of CORT greatly augmented (up to 300-fold) the neuroinflammatory responses to DFP. Anti-inflammatory pre-treatment with minocycline suppressed many proinflammatory responses to CORT+DFP. Our findings are suggestive of a possible critical, yet unrecognized interaction between the stressor/environment of the GW theater and agent exposure(s) unique to this war. Such exposures may in fact prime the CNS to amplify future neuroinflammatory responses to pathogens, injury, or toxicity. Such occurrences could potentially result in the prolonged episodes of sickness behavior observed in GWI. Gulf War (GW) veterans were exposed to stressors, prophylactic medicines and, potentially, nerve agents in theater. Subsequent development of GW Illness, a persistent multi-symptom disorder with features characteristic of sickness behavior, may be caused by priming of the CNS resulting in exaggerated neuroinflammatory responses to pathogens/insults. Nerve agent, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), produced a neuroinflammatory response that was exacerbated by pre-treatment with levels of corticosterone simulating heightened stressor conditions. While prophylactic treatments reduced DFP-induced neuroinflammation, this effect was negated when those treatments were combined with corticosterone.","[""O'Callaghan, James P"", 'Kelly, Kimberly A', 'Locker, Alicia R', 'Miller, Diane B', 'Lasley, Steve M']","[""O'Callaghan JP"", 'Kelly KA', 'Locker AR', 'Miller DB', 'Lasley SM']","['Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20150324,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Chemical Warfare Agents)', '0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Insect Repellents)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)', '134-62-3 (DEET)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chemical Warfare Agents/*toxicity', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Corticosterone/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DEET/toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Encephalitis/*chemically induced', 'Insect Repellents/toxicity', 'Isoflurophate/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Minocycline/therapeutic use', 'Persian Gulf Syndrome/*pathology']",PMC4722811,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/06/25 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jnc.13088 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2015 Jun;133(5):708-21. doi: 10.1111/jnc.13088.

HBV reactivation occurred without liver damage in this hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative patient, who was seropositive for antibodies against the viral core and surface antigens at baseline, after two cycles of CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) followed by six cycles of THP-COP regimen (cyclophosphamide, pirarubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). Unexpectedly, mogamulizumab monotherapy for relapsed CCR4 positive ATL induced sudden and fatal liver failure due to HBV reactivation, despite antiviral prophylaxis with entecavir. This clinical course may not only offer important suggestions to prevent critical HBV reactivation in HBsAg positive cancer patients who receive immune-enhancing drugs such as anti-CCR4 antibody, but also provide a clue to understanding the pathogenesis of HBV reactivation following systemic chemotherapy.","['Ifuku, Hideki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Tanaka, Yasuhito', 'Totani, Haruhito', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Okada, Masaya', 'Murakami, Shuko', 'Mizokami, Masashi', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Iida, Shinsuke']","['Ifuku H', 'Kusumoto S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Totani H', 'Ishida T', 'Okada M', 'Murakami S', 'Mizokami M', 'Ueda R', 'Iida S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Amagasaki Central Hospital, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Liver Unit, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Liver Unit, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'The Research Center for Hepatitis and Immunology, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Ichikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150415,Netherlands,Hepatol Res,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,9711801,,,,,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/03/11 06:01,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1111/hepr.12513 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatol Res. 2015 Dec;45(13):1363-7. doi: 10.1111/hepr.12513.

We have previously found that they have low rates of return to work, and a higher risk of being granted disability pension, than individuals without a history of these diseases. The aim of this study was to further investigate the labour market prognosis for these patients, by comparing the risk of being granted wage-subsidised (WS) employment as a result of permanently reduced work capacity among patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies to a reference cohort, and to determine if relative risks differ between subtypes of haematological malignancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We combined data from national registers on Danish patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies between 2000 and 2007 and a reference cohort without a history of these diseases. A total of 3194 patients and 28 627 reference individuals were followed until they were granted WS employment, disability pension, anticipatory pension, old age pension, emigration, death or until 26 February 2012, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 310 (10%) patients and 795 (3%) reference individuals had their work capacity permanently reduced to an extent that they were granted WS employment during the follow-up period. Age- and gender-adjusted relative risks differed significantly between the subgroups of haematological malignancies, and four years after diagnosis they ranged from 2.47 (95% CI 1.46-4.16) for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma to 10.83 (95% CI 7.15-16.40) for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: All eight subtypes of haematological malignancies were associated with an increased risk of being granted WS employment due to permanently reduced work capacity compared to the reference cohort. The relative risks differed according to haematological malignancy subtype, and the highest was found for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['Horsboel, Trine A', 'Nielsen, Claus V', 'Nielsen, Bendt', 'Andersen, Niels T', 'De Thurah, Annette']","['Horsboel TA', 'Nielsen CV', 'Nielsen B', 'Andersen NT', 'De Thurah A']","['Section for Clinical Social Medicine and Rehabilitation, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University , Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150309,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Employment, Supported/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/*complications/epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/economics/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Disability', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/economics/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/economics/epidemiology', 'Pensions/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retirement/statistics & numerical data', 'Return to Work/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors', 'Work Capacity Evaluation', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/10/09 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2014.999871 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2015 May;54(5):743-9. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2014.999871.

The patterns of relapses and the clinical outcomes of second-line options after fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) is given as a frontline treatment are currently unknown. In this retrospective and non-randomized study, we report the outcomes of 132 patients from databases of 14 French CLL study group centers who needed a second-line treatment after FCR frontline. Bendamustine + rituximab (BR) was the most frequently used second-line regimen, followed by alemtuzumab-based regimens, R-CHOP, and FCR. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18 months after BR with a median overall survival (OS) not reached. We also found that response durations of < 36 months and the presence of del(17p) are critical factors that contribute to poor overall survival. BR appears to be an effective salvage regimen in our series, both in terms of progression-free and overall survival. Patients who relapsed less than 36 months after FCR have a poor outcome, not significantly different in this study from patients with early relapses less than 12 or 24 months.","['Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Aurran-Schleinitz, Therese', 'Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Cazin, Bruno', 'Guieze, Romain', 'Dilhuydy, Marie-Sarah', 'Zini, Jean-Marc', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Brion, Annie', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Delmer, Alain', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Ysebaert, Loic']","['Fornecker LM', 'Aurran-Schleinitz T', 'Michallet AS', 'Cazin B', 'Guieze R', 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Zini JM', 'Tomowiak C', 'Lepretre S', 'Cymbalista F', 'Brion A', 'Feugier P', 'Delmer A', 'Leblond V', 'Ysebaert L']","['Department of Hematology, Hopitaux Universitaires De Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU De Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, Universite Clermont 1, EA7283, CREaT, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Poitiers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Nancy, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Reims, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital De La Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, IUCT-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20150401,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', '*Databases, Factual', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23999 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jun;90(6):511-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23999.

To address this issue, we retrospectively analyzed the risk of relapse in a cohort of 101 patients with AML who received grafts from an unrelated donor after a conditioning regimen including ATG. The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation, evaluated by RT qPCR, was 59% at 12 months, and 93% of CMV reactivations occurred within the first 100 days post HSCT. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with CMV reactivation was 29% compared with 37% for patients without CMV reactivation, and the only factor associated with a reduced 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was the disease status at HSCT (P < 0.001).

However, the mechanism for removal of mitochondria by autophagy is unknown. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to be required for mitophagy induction in cultured mammalian cells following mitochondrial depolarization, but its role in vivo is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Parkin-mediated mitophagy in protection against APAP-induced liver injury. We found that Parkin translocated to mitochondria in mouse livers after APAP treatment followed by mitochondrial protein ubiquitination and mitophagy induction. To our surprise, we found that mitophagy still occurred in Parkin knock-out (KO) mice after APAP treatment based on electron microscopy analysis and Western blot analysis for some mitochondrial proteins, and Parkin KO mice were protected against APAP-induced liver injury compared with wild type mice. Mechanistically, we found that Parkin KO mice had decreased activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), increased induction of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) expression, and increased hepatocyte proliferation after APAP treatment in their livers compared with WT mice. In contrast to chronic deletion of Parkin, acute knockdown of Parkin in mouse livers using adenovirus shRNA reduced mitophagy and Mcl-1 expression but increased JNK activation after APAP administration, which exacerbated APAP-induced liver injury. Therefore, chronic deletion (KO) and acute knockdown of Parkin have differential responses to APAP-induced mitophagy and liver injury in mice.","['Williams, Jessica A', 'Ni, Hong-Min', 'Haynes, Anna', 'Manley, Sharon', 'Li, Yuan', 'Jaeschke, Hartmut', 'Ding, Wen-Xing']","['Williams JA', 'Ni HM', 'Haynes A', 'Manley S', 'Li Y', 'Jaeschke H', 'Ding WX']","['From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160 wxding@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150309,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (parkin protein)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Mitophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*deficiency', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/genetics']",PMC4409255,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)42621-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.602284 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Apr 24;290(17):10934-46. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.602284.

He (Twin A) was also found to have an asymptomatic B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Although JAK2-, Twin B was subsequently shown to have a benign monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Flow cytometric and molecular analyses of the B-cell compartments revealed different immunoglobulin light and heavy chain usage in each twin. We hypothesized that whole exome sequencing could help delineating the pattern of germline B-cell disorder susceptibility and reveal somatic mutations potentially contributing to the differential patterns of pre-malignancy. Comparing bone marrow cells and T cells and employing in-house engineered integrative analysis, we found aberrations in Twin A consistent with a myeloid neoplasm, i.e. in TET2, RUNX1, PLCB1 and ELF4. Employing the method for detecting high-ranking variants by extensive annotation and relevance scoring, we also identified shared germline variants in genes of proteins interacting with B-cell receptor signalling mediators and the WNT-pathway, including IRF8, PTPRO, BCL9L, SIT1 and SIRPB1, all with possible implications in B-cell proliferation. Similar patterns of IGHV-gene usage to those demonstrated here have been observed in inherited acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Collectively, these findings may help in facilitating identification of putative master gene(s) involved in B-cell proliferations in general and MBL and B-CLL in particular.","['Hansen, Marcus C', 'Nyvold, Charlotte G', 'Roug, Anne S', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Villesen, Palle', 'Nederby, Line', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Hansen MC', 'Nyvold CG', 'Roug AS', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Villesen P', 'Nederby L', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Twin Study']",20150305,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Exome', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/genetics', 'Male', '*Precancerous Conditions', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', '*Twins, Monozygotic']",,2015/03/11 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13305 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 May;169(3):391-400. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13305.

In the present study, we have identified by sequence analysis a putative NF-kappaB binding site in a DNase I hypersensitive site, termed HS-II, located in the distant 5' flanking region of the CYBB gene. Electrophoretic mobility assays showed binding of the sequence element by recombinant NF-kappaB protein p50 and by proteins in nuclear extract from the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line corresponding to p50 and to p50/p65 heterodimers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated NF-kappaB binding to the site in intact HL-60 cells. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays demonstrated physical interaction between the NF-kappaB binding site and the CYBB promoter region. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by salicylate reduced CYBB expression in peripheral blood neutrophils and differentiated U937 monocytic leukemia cells. U937 cells transfected with a mutant inhibitor of kappaB ""super-repressor"" showed markedly diminished CYBB expression. Luciferase reporter analysis of the NF-kappaB site linked to the CYBB 5' flanking promoter region revealed enhanced expression, augmented by treatment with interferon-gamma. These studies indicate a role for this distant, 15 kb upstream, binding site in NF-kappaB regulation of the CYBB gene, an essential component of phagocyte-mediated host defense.","['Frazao, Josias B', 'Thain, Alison', 'Zhu, Zhiqing', 'Luengo, Marcos', 'Condino-Neto, Antonio', 'Newburger, Peter E']","['Frazao JB', 'Thain A', 'Zhu Z', 'Luengo M', 'Condino-Neto A', 'Newburger PE']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 05508-900, Brazil.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and of Molecular, Cellular, and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01655.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and of Molecular, Cellular, and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01655.', 'Center for Investigation in Pediatrics, State University of Campinas Medical School, Campinas, SP 13081-970, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 05508-900, Brazil.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and of Molecular, Cellular, and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Salicylates)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Salicylates/pharmacology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",PMC5551681,2015/03/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:00,['2015/03/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25155 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2015 Sep;116(9):2008-17. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25155.,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['CYBB', 'ENHANCER', 'GENE EXPRESSION', 'NF-kappaB', 'PHAGOCYTE OXIDASE']","['R01 DK054369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-54369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS890281'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The production of retroviral vectors from stable packaging cell lines using roller bottles or 10- to 40-layer cell factories is limited by a narrow harvest window, labor intensity, open-system operations, and the requirement for significant incubator space. To circumvent these shortcomings, we optimized the production of vector stocks in a disposable fixed-bed bioreactor using good manufacturing practice-grade packaging cell lines. High-titer vector stocks were harvested over 10 days, representing a much broader harvest window than the 3-day harvest afforded by cell factories. For PG13 and 293Vec packaging cells, the average vector titer and the vector stocks' yield in the bioreactor were higher by 3.2- to 7.3-fold, and 5.6- to 13.1-fold, respectively, than those obtained in cell factories. The vector production was 10.4 and 18.6 times more efficient than in cell factories for PG13 and 293Vec cells, respectively. Furthermore, the vectors produced from the fixed-bed bioreactors passed the release test assays for clinical applications. Therefore, a single vector lot derived from 293Vec is suitable to transduce up to 500 patients cell doses in the context of large clinical trials using chimeric antigen receptors or T-cell receptors.

The histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) coordinates recruitment of CLOCK-BMAL1 activator complexes to chromatin, an event associated with cyclic trimethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) at circadian promoters. Remarkably, in mouse liver circadian H3K4 trimethylation is modulated by SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase involved in clock control. We show that mammalian MLL1 is acetylated at two conserved residues, K1130 and K1133. Notably, MLL1 acetylation is cyclic, controlled by the clock and by SIRT1, and it affects the methyltransferase activity of MLL1. Moreover, H3K4 methylation at clock-controlled-gene promoters is influenced by pharmacological or genetic inactivation of SIRT1. Finally, levels of MLL1 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation at circadian gene promoters depend on NAD(+) circadian levels. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated regulatory pathway between energy metabolism and histone methylation.","['Aguilar-Arnal, Lorena', 'Katada, Sayako', 'Orozco-Solis, Ricardo', 'Sassone-Corsi, Paolo']","['Aguilar-Arnal L', 'Katada S', 'Orozco-Solis R', 'Sassone-Corsi P']","['Center for Epigenetics and Metabolism, U904 INSERM, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics and Metabolism, U904 INSERM, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics and Metabolism, U904 INSERM, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics and Metabolism, U904 INSERM, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150309,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Chromatin', 'Circadian Clocks/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sirtuin 1/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC4732879,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nsmb.2990 [pii]', '10.1038/nsmb.2990 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2015 Apr;22(4):312-8. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.2990.

We therefore took up the present study to explore if the leishmanial lipid (pLLD) isolated from L. donovani can play an anti-neoplastic role in acute myeloid leukemia cells by regulating cellular growth. Indeed pLLD significantly inhibited cell proliferation of four AML cell lines (HL-60, MOLT-4, U937, and K562). Scanning electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that it significantly induced apoptosis of U937 cells through morphological alteration. Occurrence of apoptosis was checked by using Annexin exposure and this established that the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase in time-dependent manner. pLLD increased the intracellular ROS with alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, as detected using DCFDA. It also regulated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins like Bax, Bcl2, Bad and t-Bid besides causing cleavage of PARP as determined by western blot analysis. Treatment of U937 cells with pLLD induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, p38, and caspases 9/3. The results suggest that pLLD induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells possibly via increasing intracellular ROS and regulating the MAPK pathway.","['Chatterjee, Nabanita', 'Das, Subhadip', 'Bose, Dipayan', 'Banerjee, Somenath', 'Jha, Tarun', 'Das Saha, Krishna']","['Chatterjee N', 'Das S', 'Bose D', 'Banerjee S', 'Jha T', 'Das Saha K']","['Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

In many cancers, loss of PP2A activity has been associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Loss of PP2A results in failure to turn off survival signaling cascades that drive drug resistance such as those regulated by protein kinase B. PP2A is responsible for modulating function and controlling expression of tumor suppressors such as p53 and oncogenes such as BCL2 and MYC. Thus, PP2A has diverse functions regulating cell survival. The importance of microRNAs (miRs) is emerging in cancer biology. A role for miR regulation of PP2A is not well understood; however, recent studies suggest a number of clinically significant miRs such as miR-155 and miR-19 may include PP2A targets. We have recently found that a PP2A B subunit (B55alpha) can regulate a number of miRs in acute myeloid leukemia cells. The identification of a miR/PP2A axis represents a novel regulatory pathway in cellular homeostasis. The ability of miRs to suppress specific PP2A targets and for PP2A to control such miRs can add an extra level of control in signaling that could be used as a rheostat for many signaling cascades that maintain cellular homeostasis. As such, loss of PP2A or expression of miRs relevant for PP2A function could promote tumorigenesis or at least result in drug resistance. In this review, we will cover the current state of miR regulation of PP2A with a focus on leukemia. We will also briefly discuss what is known of PP2A regulation of miR expression.","['Ruvolo, Peter P']",['Ruvolo PP'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150220,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC4335100,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/03/10 06:01,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00043 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Feb 20;5:43. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00043. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'PP2A', 'leukemia', 'microRNA', 'signal transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified WT1 protein-derived promiscuous helper peptide, WT1332. Therefore, isolation and characterization of the WT1332-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) are useful to develop broadly applicable TCR gene-based adoptive immunotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel HLA-DRB1*04:05-restricted WT1332-specific TCR gene was cloned and transduced into human CD4+ T-cells by using a lentiviral vector. RESULTS: The WT1332-specific TCR-transduced CD4+ T-cells showed strong proliferation and Th1-cytokine production in an HLA-DRB1*04:05-restricted, WT1332-specific manner. Furthermore, the WT1332-specific TCR-transduced CD4+ T-cells could lyse HLA-DRB1*04:05-positive, WT1-expressing leukemia cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: The novel TCR gene cloned here should be a promising tool to develop adoptive immunotherapy of WT1332-specific TCR-transduced CD4+ T-cells for the treatment of WT1-expressing cancer, such as leukemia.","['Katsuhara, Akiko', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Aoyama, Nao', 'Tanii, Satoe', 'Morimoto, Soyoko', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Kondo, Kenta', 'Tatsumi, Naoya', 'Nakata, Jun', 'Nakae, Yoshiki', 'Takashima, Satoshi', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Sogo, Shinji', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Katsuhara A', 'Fujiki F', 'Aoyama N', 'Tanii S', 'Morimoto S', 'Oka Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Nakajima H', 'Kondo K', 'Tatsumi N', 'Nakata J', 'Nakae Y', 'Takashima S', 'Nishida S', 'Hosen N', 'Sogo S', 'Oji Y', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan Department of Immunopathology, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Microbiological Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan sugiyama@sahs.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (HLA-DRB1*04:05 antigen)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokines/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['35/3/1251 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 Mar;35(3):1251-61.,"['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['HLA class II', 'HLA-DRB1*04:05', 'TCR gene therapy', ""Wilms' tumor gene (WT1)"", 'helper peptide']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine studies directly link primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and decreased PU.1 expression in specifically modified strains. Similarly, a radiation-induced chromosome 2 deletion and subsequent Sfpi1 point mutation in the remaining allele lead to murine radiation-induced AML. Consistent with murine data, heterozygous deletion of the SPI1 locus and mutation of the -14kb SPI1 upstream regulatory element were described previously in human primary AML, although they are rare events. Other mechanisms linked to PU.1 downregulation in human AML include TP53 deletion, FLT3-ITD mutation and the recurrent AML1-ETO [t(8;21)] and PML-RARA [t(15;17)] translocations. This review provides an up-to-date overview on our current understanding of the involvement of PU.1 in the initiation and development of radiation-induced AML, together with recommendations for future murine and human studies.","['Verbiest, Tom', 'Bouffler, Simon', 'Nutt, Stephen L', 'Badie, Christophe']","['Verbiest T', 'Bouffler S', 'Nutt SL', 'Badie C']","['Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Didcot OX11 ORQ, UK, CRUK & MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK.', 'Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Didcot OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia and Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Didcot OX11 ORQ, UK, christophe.badie@phe.gov.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150306,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'X-Rays/adverse effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC4392607,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/06/18 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bgv016 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgv016 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2015 Apr;36(4):413-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgv016.

Despite remarkable success in controlling CML at chronic phase by Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a significant proportion of CML patients treated with TKIs develop drug resistance due to the inability of TKIs to kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are responsible for initiation, drug resistance, and relapse of CML. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more potent and safer therapies against leukemia stem cells for curing CML. A number of LSC-associated targets and corresponding signaling pathways, including CaMKII-gamma, a critical molecular switch for co-activating multiple LSC-associated signaling pathways, have been identified over the past decades and various small inhibitors targeting LSC are also under development. Increasing evidence shows that leukemia stem cells are the root of CML and targeting LSC may offer a curable treatment option for CML patients. This review summarizes the molecular biology of LSC and its-associated targets, and the potential clinical application in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Zhou, Hong', 'Xu, Rongzhen']","['Zhou H', 'Xu R']","['Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150310,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC4444810,2015/03/10 06:00,2016/02/20 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13238-015-0143-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Cell. 2015 Jun;6(6):403-12. doi: 10.1007/s13238-015-0143-7.

In a randomized, phase II trial enrolling 145 adult patients, we compared intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (50 mg: 6/8 injections in B-/T-cell subsets, respectively) with intrathecal triple therapy (methotrexate/cytarabine/prednisone: 12 injections). Systemic therapy included methotrexate plus cytarabine or L-asparaginase courses, with methotrexate augmented to 2.5 and 5 g/m(2) in Philadelphia-negative B- and T-cell disease, respectively. The primary study objective was the comparative assessment of the risk/benefit ratio, combining the analysis of feasibility, toxicity and efficacy. In the liposomal cytarabine arm 17/71 patients (24%) developed grade 3-4 neurotoxicity compared to 2/74 (3%) in the triple therapy arm (P=0.0002), the median number of episodes of neurotoxicity of any grade was one per patient compared to zero, respectively (P=0.0001), and even though no permanent disabilities or deaths were registered, four patients (6%) discontinued intrathecal prophylaxis on account of these toxic side effects (P=0.06). Neurotoxicity worsened with liposomal cytarabine every 14 days (T-cell disease), and was improved by the adjunct of intrathecal dexamethasone. Two patients in the liposomal cytarabine arm suffered from a meningeal relapse (none with T-cell disease, only one after high-dose chemotherapy) compared to four in the triple therapy arm (1 with T-cell disease). While intrathecal liposomal cytarabine could contribute to improved, radiation-free central nervous system prophylaxis, the toxicity reported in this trial does not support its use at 50 mg and prompts the investigation of a lower dosage.

This patient showed striking hematological manifestations including a large number of pseudo-PHA, a severe degree of left shift, and dysplastic granulocytes. These hematological presentations on the peripheral smear all resolved with doxycycline treatment, implying that the changes were most likely reactive manifestations secondary to HGA, rather than underlying hematological malignancies such as MDS or AML.","['Lee, Sunyoung', 'Khankhanian, Pouya', 'Salama, Carlos', 'Brown, Maritza', 'Lieber, Joseph']","['Lee S', 'Khankhanian P', 'Salama C', 'Brown M', 'Lieber J']","['Department of Medicine, Elmhurst Hospital Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 7901 Broadway, Elmhurst, NY, 11373, USA, syandsy@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150307,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Pelger-Huet Anomaly/*diagnosis']",,2015/03/10 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1769-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jul;102(1):129-33. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1769-1.

Various studies have demonstrated that IRF8 is essential for the development of monocytes, DCs, eosinophils, and basophils. Conversely, IRF8 suppresses the generation of neutrophils. Accordingly, Irf8 (-/-) mice develop immunodeficiency and a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like disease. Mutations and loss of expression of the human IRF8 gene are also associated with immunodeficiency and CML, respectively. Recent findings have begun to reveal the transcription factor network and epigenetic changes governed by IRF8. For example, in mononuclear phagocyte progenitors, IRF8 cooperates with PU.1 to promote the formation of promoter-distal enhancers to induce monocyte-related genes including the critical downstream transcription factor gene Klf4. On the other hand, IRF8 blocks C/EBPalpha activity to suppress the neutrophil differentiation program. Indeed, Irf8 (-/-) mononuclear phagocyte progenitors fail to efficiently generate monocytes and DCs and, instead, aberrantly give rise to neutrophils. This article provides an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the role of IRF8 in myelopoiesis and related diseases.","['Tamura, Tomohiko', 'Kurotaki, Daisuke', 'Koizumi, Shin-ichi']","['Tamura T', 'Kurotaki D', 'Koizumi S']","['Department of Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan, tamurat@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150307,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Myelopoiesis']",,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1761-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Apr;101(4):342-51. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1761-9.

METHODS: New Zealand cancer registry data was linked to hospitalization, pharmaceutical, outpatient, general practice, laboratory, and other datasets, with costs ascribed to each event occurring in 2006-2011. ""Excess"" cancer costs were estimated by subtracting ""expected costs"" for citizens without cancer from the ""total cost"" for cancer patients ($2011 inflation-adjusted). Gamma regressions were used to estimate costs per person-month. RESULTS: For first adult cancer diagnosed that the excess cost per person was between US$3400 and US$4300 in the first month postdiagnosis (varied by sex and age), fell to US$50-US$150 per month at 2 or more years postdiagnosis (excluding those within a year of death), but increased again if dying from their cancer (US$3800-US$8300 in the last month of life). Such patterns varied by cancer, for example, in the first month postdiagnosis for 65 year olds it varied 20-fold from US$800 for prostate to US$15,900 for brain cancer. Per diagnosed case, total excess costs varied from US$5000 (melanoma) to US$66,000 (bone and connective tissue) [Corrected]. Excess cancer costs made up 6.5% of total Vote:Health expenditure in 2010-2011, with colorectal (14.7%), breast (14.4%) being the top 2 contributors, and prostate, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and lung each contributing about 6%. CONCLUSIONS: Costs vary substantially by time since diagnosis and cancer type. The results and regression equations reported in this paper can be used in modeling requiring cancer costs by time since diagnosis and proximity to death.","['Blakely, Tony', 'Atkinson, June', 'Kvizhinadze, Giorgi', 'Wilson, Nick', 'Davies, Anna', 'Clarke, Philip']","['Blakely T', 'Atkinson J', 'Kvizhinadze G', 'Wilson N', 'Davies A', 'Clarke P']","['*Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand daggerCentre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics School of Population Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', 'Neoplasms/*economics', 'New Zealand', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC4379114,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MLR.0000000000000330 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Care. 2015 Apr;53(4):302-9. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000330.,,,,,,,,,,['Med Care. 2015 Jun;53(6):560'],,,,,,,

Several immunohistochemistry markers have been identified to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from HGDNs. However, sensitivity or specificity of the individual marker is still limited. In this study, we analyzed dynamic alteration of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and CD34 during hepatocarcinogenesis from dysplastic nodules to small HCC. The diagnostic performance of LIFR and CD34 combination in WD-HCC and HGDNs was investigated by logistic regression models and validated in an independent validation cohort. LIFR was decreased and CD34 was increased along with stepwise progression of hepatocarcinogenesis from low-grade dysplastic nodules (LGDNs) to small HCC. The sensitivity and specificity of the LIFR and CD34 combination for WD-HCC detection were 93.5% and 90.5%, respectively. In addition, colony formation assay was used to explore the role of LIFR in tumorigenesis. Silencing of LIFR could significantly promote colony formation of HCC cells, whereas ectopic overexpression of LIFR resulted in impaired ability of colony formation of HCC cells. These findings indicate that LIFR and CD34 combination may be used as an available differential diagnostic model for WD-HCC from HGDNs in clinical practice.","['Luo, Qin', 'Zhang, Yurong', 'Wang, Ning', 'Jin, Guangzhi', 'Jin, Haojie', 'Gu, Dishui', 'Tao, Xuemei', 'Huo, Xisong', 'Ge, Tianxiang', 'Cong, Wenming', 'Wang, Cun', 'Qin, Wenxin']","['Luo Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang N', 'Jin G', 'Jin H', 'Gu D', 'Tao X', 'Huo X', 'Ge T', 'Cong W', 'Wang C', 'Qin W']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data Mining', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*metabolism', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC4466664,2015/03/10 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['3136 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3136 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 30;6(9):6989-99. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3136.,,['NOTNLM'],"['hepatocellular carcinoma', 'high-grade dysplastic nodules', 'leukemia inhibitory factor receptor', 'well differentiated-small hepatocellular carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this issue, a new triapine-resistant cell line (SW480/tria) was generated by drug selection and investigated in this study. Notably, SW480/tria cells displayed broad cross-resistance against several known ABCB1 substrates due to high ABCB1 levels (induced by promoter hypomethylation). However, ABCB1 inhibition did not re-sensitize SW480/tria cells to triapine and subsequent analysis revealed that triapine is only a weak ABCB1 substrate without significant interaction with the ABCB1 transport function. Interestingly, in chemo-naive, parental SW480 cells short-time (24 h) treatment with triapine stimulated ABCB1 expression. These effects were based on activation of protein kinase C (PKC), a known response to cellular stress. In accordance, SW480/tria cells were characterized by elevated levels of PKC. Together, this led to the conclusion that increased ABCB1 expression is not the major mechanism of triapine resistance in SW480/tria cells. In contrast, increased ABCB1 expression was found to be a consequence of triapine stress-induced PKC activation. These data are especially of importance when considering the choice of chemotherapeutics for combination with triapine.","['Miklos, W', 'Pelivan, K', 'Kowol, C R', 'Pirker, C', 'Dornetshuber-Fleiss, R', 'Spitzwieser, M', 'Englinger, B', 'van Schoonhoven, S', 'Cichna-Markl, M', 'Koellensperger, G', 'Keppler, B K', 'Berger, W', 'Heffeter, P']","['Miklos W', 'Pelivan K', 'Kowol CR', 'Pirker C', 'Dornetshuber-Fleiss R', 'Spitzwieser M', 'Englinger B', 'van Schoonhoven S', 'Cichna-Markl M', 'Koellensperger G', 'Keppler BK', 'Berger W', 'Heffeter P']","['Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, Waehringer Str. 42, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, Waehringer Str. 42, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Waehringer Str. 38, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Waehringer Str. 38, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Waehringer Str. 38, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, Waehringer Str. 42, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.

We identified Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a target for sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to chemoradiation. In the present study we investigated Mcl-1 inhibition by either genetic or pharmacological approaches as a radiosensitizing strategy in pancreatic cancer cells. Mcl-1 depletion by siRNA produced significant radiosensitization in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells in association with Caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, but only minimal radiosensitization in MiaPaCa-2 cells. We next tested the ability of the recently identified, selective, small molecule inhibitor of Mcl-1, UMI77, to radiosensitize in pancreatic cancer cells. UMI77 caused dissociation of Mcl-1 from the pro-apoptotic protein Bak and produced significant radiosensitization in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells, but minimal radiosensitization in MiaPaCa-2 cells. Radiosensitization by UMI77 was associated with Caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Importantly, UMI77 did not radiosensitize normal small intestinal cells. In contrast, ABT-737, an established inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, failed to radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells suggesting the unique importance of Mcl-1 relative to other Bcl-2 family members to radiation survival in pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, these results validate Mcl-1 as a target for radiosensitization of pancreatic cancer cells and demonstrate the ability of small molecules which bind the canonical BH3 groove of Mcl-1, causing displacement of Mcl-1 from Bak, to selectively radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells.","['Wei, Dongping', 'Zhang, Qiang', 'Schreiber, Jason S', 'Parsels, Leslie A', 'Abulwerdi, Fardokht A', 'Kausar, Tasneem', 'Lawrence, Theodore S', 'Sun, Yi', 'Nikolovska-Coleska, Zaneta', 'Morgan, Meredith A']","['Wei D', 'Zhang Q', 'Schreiber JS', 'Parsels LA', 'Abulwerdi FA', 'Kausar T', 'Lawrence TS', 'Sun Y', 'Nikolovska-Coleska Z', 'Morgan MA']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School.

Thus, RA enhanced autophagy in TLR9- and CD180-stimulated peripheral blood B cells, as revealed by increased levels of the autophagosomal marker LC3B-II, enhanced colocalization between LC3B and the lysosomal marker Lyso-ID, by a larger percentage of cells with more than 5 characteristic LC3B puncta, and by the concomitant reduction in the level of SQSTM1/p62. Furthermore, RA induced expression of the autophagy-inducing protein ULK1 at the transcriptional level, in a process that required the retinoic acid receptor RAR. By inhibiting autophagy with specific inhibitors or by knocking down ULK1 by siRNA, the RA-stimulated IgG production in TLR9- and CD180-mediated cells was markedly reduced. We propose that the identified prominent role of autophagy in RA-mediated IgG-production in normal human B cells provides a novel mechanism whereby vitamin A exerts its important functions in the immune system.","['Eriksen, Agnete Bratsberg', 'Torgersen, Maria Lyngaas', 'Holm, Kristine Lillebo', 'Abrahamsen, Greger', 'Spurkland, Anne', 'Moskaug, Jan Oivind', 'Simonsen, Anne', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil']","['Eriksen AB', 'Torgersen ML', 'Holm KL', 'Abrahamsen G', 'Spurkland A', 'Moskaug JO', 'Simonsen A', 'Blomhoff HK']","['a Department of Biochemistry ; Institute of Basic Medical Sciences; University of Oslo ; Oslo , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD180 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3B protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ULK1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'CpG Islands', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Immunoglobulin G/*biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/chemistry', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*chemistry']",PMC4502696,2015/03/10 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15548627.2015.1009797 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2015;11(3):460-71. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2015.1009797.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATG, autophagy-related', 'B lymphocytes', 'BDS, bright detail similarity', 'CD180', 'CD180, CD180 molecule', 'CVID, common variable immune deficiency', 'ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay', 'IL, interleukin', 'Ig, immunoglobulin', 'MAP1LC3B/LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta', 'MTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase)', 'PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern, PML/RARA, promyelocytic leukemia/', 'retinoic acid receptor alpha', 'RA, all-trans retinoic acid', 'RAR, retinoic acid receptor', 'RP105', 'SQSTM1, sequestosome 1', 'TLR, toll-like receptor', 'TLR9', 'ULK1', 'ULK1, unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1', 'antibody secretion', 'autophagy', 'plasma cell differentiation', 'retinoic acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we set out to analyze whether MCL1, a known mediator of chemotherapy resistance regulates the cellular response to androgen withdrawal. Analysis of MCL1 protein and mRNA expression in PCa tissue and primary cell culture specimens of luminal and basal origin, respectively, reveals higher expression in cancerous tissue compared to benign origin. Using PCa cellular models in vitro and in vivo we show that MCL1 expression is upregulated in androgen-deprived PCa cells. Regulation of MCL1 through the AR signaling axis is indirectly mediated via a cell cycle-dependent mechanism. Using constructs downregulating or overexpressing MCL1 we demonstrate that expression of MCL1 prevents induction of apoptosis when PCa cells are grown under steroid-deprived conditions. The BH3-mimetic Obatoclax induces apoptosis and decreases MCL1 expression in androgen-sensitive PCa cells, while castration-resistant PCa cells are less sensitive and react with an upregulation of MCL1 expression. Synergistic effects of Obatoclax with androgen receptor inactivation can be observed. Moreover, clonogenicity of primary basal PCa cells is efficiently inhibited by Obatoclax. Altogether, our results suggest that MCL1 is a key molecule deciding over the fate of PCa cells upon inactivation of androgen receptor signaling.","['Santer, Frederic R', 'Erb, Holger H H', 'Oh, Su Jung', 'Handle, Florian', 'Feiersinger, Gertrud E', 'Luef, Birgit', 'Bu, Huajie', 'Schafer, Georg', 'Ploner, Christian', 'Egger, Martina', 'Rane, Jayant K', 'Maitland, Norman J', 'Klocker, Helmut', 'Eder, Iris E', 'Culig, Zoran']","['Santer FR', 'Erb HH', 'Oh SJ', 'Handle F', 'Feiersinger GE', 'Luef B', 'Bu H', 'Schafer G', 'Ploner C', 'Egger M', 'Rane JK', 'Maitland NJ', 'Klocker H', 'Eder IE', 'Culig Z']","['Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Yorkshire Cancer Research Unit, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Yorkshire Cancer Research Unit, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'Yorkshire Cancer Research Unit, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Urology, Division of Experimental Urology, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Random Allocation', 'Receptors, Androgen/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4467425,2015/03/10 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['3368 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3368 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 20;6(8):6105-22. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3368.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2 family', 'cell cycle arrest', 'cell death', 'endocrine therapy', 'treatment resistance']",['W 1101/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These structures have an important role in assembling signaling molecules (e.g., Rac-1, RhoH and Lyn) together with surface receptors, such as the CXCR4 receptor for alpha-chemokine stromal-derived factor-1, the alpha4beta1-integrin receptor (VLA-4) for vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and the c-kit receptor for stem cell factor, which together regulate several aspects of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) biology. Here, we discuss the role of lipid raft integrity in the retention and quiescence of normal HSPCs in bone marrow niches as well as in regulating HSPC mobilization and homing.

Here, we assessed the prognostic importance of response during induction and consolidation treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) aiming to evaluate the best time to assess minimal residual disease (MRD) for intervention strategies and in future trials in high-risk ALL relapse patients. Included patients (n=125) were treated uniformly according to the ALL-REZ BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) 2002 relapse trial (median follow-up time=4.8 years). Patients with MRD 10(-3) after induction treatment (76/119, 64%) or immediately preceding HSCT (19/71, 27%) had a significantly worse probability of disease-free survival 10 years after relapse treatment begin, with 26% (+/-6%) or 23% (+/-7%), respectively, compared with 58% (+/-8%) or 48% (+/-7%) for patients with MRD <10(-3). Conventional intensive consolidation treatment reduced MRD to <10(-3) before HSCT in 63% of patients, whereas MRD remained high or increased in the rest of this patient group. Our data support that MRD after induction treatment can be used to quantify the activity of different induction treatment strategies in phase II trials. MRD persistence at 10(-3) before HSCT reflects a disease highly resistant to conventional intensive chemotherapy and requiring prospective controlled investigation of new treatment strategies and drugs.","['Eckert, C', 'Hagedorn, N', 'Sramkova, L', 'Mann, G', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R', 'Peters, C', 'Bourquin, J-P', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Cario, G', 'Alten, J', 'Escherich, G', 'Astrahantseff, K', 'Seeger, K', 'Henze, G', 'von Stackelberg, A']","['Eckert C', 'Hagedorn N', 'Sramkova L', 'Mann G', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Peters C', 'Bourquin JP', 'Klingebiel T', 'Borkhardt A', 'Cario G', 'Alten J', 'Escherich G', 'Astrahantseff K', 'Seeger K', 'Henze G', 'von Stackelberg A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '1] Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic [2] CLIP - Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""St Anna Children's Research Institute and Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""St Anna Children's Research Institute and Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""St Anna Children's Research Institute and Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe-University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150309,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Male', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201559 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.59 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1648-55. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.59.

It ranks among the commonest cancers in childhood and is characterized by excessive proliferation and differentiation block. The process of leukemogenesis is governed by genetic changes at both the cytogenetic and molecular level. According to numerous analyses, a large spectrum of mutations and rearrangements underlying the disease affect essential cellular transduction pathways, genes ensuring proper course of hematopoiesis, oncogenes, tumor suppressors and apoptosis regulators. Common lesions include translocations to T cell receptor (TCR) loci in T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), mutations of transcription factors regulating B-lineage development and cell maturation in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (PAX5, TCF3, EBF1, etc.), aberrational disruption of genes coding for transcription factors and coactivators in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (e.g. CBF) or BCR-ABL1 fusion and activation of multiple kinases in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). These alterations severely impair cell function. Broadening knowledge of the genetic background gives an insight into the pathobiology of a disease and allows for a better understanding of it. An appropriate investigation of genomic events yields diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. Broadening knowledge of the pathogenesis of leukemia seems to be a promising contribution to precise stratification of patients, reducing the toxicity and adverse effects caused by medical intervention, treatment personalization and introduction of targeted therapy accessible to a wide range of patients.","['Kesy, Julita', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta']","['Kesy J', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D']","['Medical Biotechnology Student at Poznan University of Medical Sciences.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Haematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150305,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2015/03/10 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1142719 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1142719 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2015 Mar 5;69:302-8. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1142719.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mesenchymal phenotype is associated with greater aggressiveness and low survival in contrast to GBMs enriched with proneural genes. The proinflammatory cytokines secreted in the microenvironment of gliomas play a key role in tumor progression. The study focused on the role of Oncostatin-M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine in inducing mesenchymal properties in GBM. Analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT data revealed that expression of OSMR but not IL-6R or LIFR is upregulated in GBM and has negative correlation with survival. Amongst the GBM subtypes, OSMR level was in the order of mesenchymal > classical > neural > proneural. TCGA data and RT-PCR analysis in primary cultures of low and high grade gliomas showed a positive correlation between OSMR and mesenchymal signature genes-YKL40/CHI3L1, fibronectin and vimentin and a negative correlation with proneural signature genes-DLL3, Olig2 and BCAN. OSM enhanced transcript and protein level of fibronectin and YKL-40 and reduced the expression of Olig2 and DLL3 in GBM cells. OSM-regulated mesenchymal phenotype was associated with enhanced MMP-9 activity, increased cell migration and invasion. Importantly, OSM induced mesenchymal markers and reduced proneural genes even in primary cultures of grade-III glioma cells. We conclude that OSM-mediated signaling contributes to aggressive nature associated with mesenchymal features via STAT3 signaling in glioma cells. The data suggest that OSMR can be explored as potential target for therapeutic intervention.","['Natesh, Kumar', 'Bhosale, Dipali', 'Desai, Aarti', 'Chandrika, Goparaju', 'Pujari, Radha', 'Jagtap, Jayashree', 'Chugh, Ashish', 'Ranade, Deepak', 'Shastry, Padma']","['Natesh K', 'Bhosale D', 'Desai A', 'Chandrika G', 'Pujari R', 'Jagtap J', 'Chugh A', 'Ranade D', 'Shastry P']","['National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.', 'Persistent Systems Ltd., Pune, India.', 'Persistent Systems Ltd., Pune, India.', 'National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.', 'National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.', 'National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.', ""Department of Neurosurgery, Cimet's Inamdar Multispeciality Hospital, Pune, India."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, D.

Among which, ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) alone was found to exhibit leishmanicidal effect validated through cytotoxicity assay and estimated its IC(5)(0) to be 52.4 microg/ml on the promastigote stage. Propidium iodide (PI) staining of dead cells substantiated the aforementioned activity. Carboxy fluorescein-diaceate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining of promastigotes has affirmed its anti-proliferation activity. The characteristic features such as DNA fragmentation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased sub G0/G1 phase parasites and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in EAF treated promastigotes indicate the apoptosis like death. In addition, the reduced parasite burden both in vitro (viz. ~45% in human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) and ~50% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and in vivo (spleen and liver) provides the evidence for its anti-leishmanial activity on amastigote stage. The increase of ROS levels in THP-1 and nitric oxide (NO) production from J774.1 cell line (mouse macrophages) upon EAF treatment was evidenced for oxidative killing of intracellular amastigotes. Active immunomodulatory activity at m-RNA level (viz. upregulation of Th1 cytokines, and downregulation of Th2 cytokines) both in vitro and in vivo was also shown to be exhibited by EAF.

Our primary goal was to determine the cost structure for the HSCT program model developed over the last decade at our public university hospital and to assess its clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults and children receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from January 2010 to February 2011 at our hematology regional reference center were included. Laboratory tests, medical procedures, chemotherapy drugs, other drugs, and hospitalization costs were scrutinized to calculate the total cost for each patient and the median cost for the procedure. Data regarding clinical evolution were incorporated into the analysis. Physician fees are not charged at the institution and therefore were not included. RESULTS: Fifty patients were evaluated over a 1-year period. The total estimated cost for an allogeneic HSCT was $12,504. The two most expensive diseases to allograft were non-Hodgkin lymphoma ($11,760 +/- $2,236) for the malignant group and thalassemia ($12,915 +/- $5,170) for the nonmalignant group. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ($11,053 +/- 2,817) and acute myeloblastic leukemia ($10,251 +/- $1,538) were the most frequent indications for HSCT, with 11 cases each. Median out-of-pocket expenses were $1,605, and 1-year follow-up costs amounted to $1,640, adding up to a total cost of $15,749 for the first year. The most expensive components were drugs and laboratory tests. CONCLUSION: Applying the cost structure described, HSCT is an affordable option for hematological patients living in a developing country.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Heredia-Salazar, Alberto Carlos', 'Cantu-Rodriguez, Olga G', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Homero', 'Villarreal-Villarreal, Cesar Daniel', 'Mancias-Guerra, Consuelo', 'Herrera-Garza, Jose Luis', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Heredia-Salazar AC', 'Cantu-Rodriguez OG', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre H', 'Villarreal-Villarreal CD', 'Mancias-Guerra C', 'Herrera-Garza JL', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine Division, Dr. Jose E.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the associations of genetic polymorphisms in folate pathway and DNA repair genes with susceptibility to ALL. In total, 121 children with ALL and 184 unrelated healthy controls of Slovenian origin were genotyped for 14 polymorphisms in seven genes of folate pathway, base excision repair and homologous recombination repair (TYMS, MTHFR, OGG1, XRCC1, NBN, RAD51, and XRCC3). In addition, the exon 6 of NBN was screened for the presence of mutations using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. Twelve polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls and their genotype frequencies were in agreement with those reported in other Caucasian populations. Among the investigated polymorphisms and mutations, NBN Glu185Gln significantly decreased susceptibility to B-cell ALL (p=0.037), while TYMS 3R allele decreased susceptibility to T-cell ALL (p=0.011). Moreover, significantly decreased susceptibility to ALL was observed for MTHFR TA (p=0.030) and RAD51 GTT haplotypes (p=0.016). Susceptibility to ALL increased with the increasing number of risk alleles (ptrend=0.007). We also observed significant influence of hOGG-RAD51 and NBN-RAD51 interactions on susceptibility to ALL. Our results suggest that combination of several polymorphisms in DNA repair and folate pathways may significantly affect susceptibility to childhood ALL.","['Goricar, Katja', 'Erculj, Nina', 'Faganel Kotnik, Barbara', 'Debeljak, Marusa', 'Hovnik, Tinka', 'Jazbec, Janez', 'Dolzan, Vita']","['Goricar K', 'Erculj N', 'Faganel Kotnik B', 'Debeljak M', 'Hovnik T', 'Jazbec J', 'Dolzan V']","['University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Vrazov trg 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression is positively correlated with lung cancer malignancy. The mechanism underlying an elevated MMP9 expression is not clearly defined. We demonstrate here that the transcriptional modulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) was activated by hypoxia and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), two prominent pro-malignancy factors, in cultured lung cancer cells. MKL1 levels were also increased in more invasive types of lung cancer in humans. Depletion of MKL1 in lung cancer cells attenuated migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of MKL1 potentiated the induction of MMP9 transcription by hypoxia and TGF-beta, whereas MKL1 silencing diminished MMP9 expression. Of interest, MKL1 knockdown eliminated histone H3K4 methylation surrounding the MMP9 promoter. Further analyses revealed that MKL1 recruited ASH2, a component of the H3K4 methyltransferase complex, to activate MMP9 transcription. Depletion of ASH2 ameliorated cancer cell migration and invasion in an MMP9-dependent manner. Together our data indicate that MKL1 potentiates lung cancer cell migration and invasion by epigenetically activating MMP9 transcription.","['Cheng, X', 'Yang, Y', 'Fan, Z', 'Yu, L', 'Bai, H', 'Zhou, B', 'Wu, X', 'Xu, H', 'Fang, M', 'Shen, A', 'Chen, Q', 'Xu, Y']","['Cheng X', 'Yang Y', 'Fan Z', 'Yu L', 'Bai H', 'Zhou B', 'Wu X', 'Xu H', 'Fang M', 'Shen A', 'Chen Q', 'Xu Y']","['Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Wuxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Nursing, Jiangsu Jiankang Vocational University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Key Laboratory of Inflammation and Molecular Targets, Medical College, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150309,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (MMP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Epigenomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics']",,2015/03/10 06:00,2016/02/03 06:00,['2015/03/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201514 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.14 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Oct 29;34(44):5570-81. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.14.

The main objective is to measure adherence to IM by evaluating individual patient characteristics, personal behaviour and, treatment related psychological factors influencing adherence behaviour. Hundred patients receiving IM were analysed for adherence behaviour using 9 item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (9-MMAS). Various factors were assessed for their impact on adherence behaviour. These factors were age, gender, duration of treatment, frequency and dosing of treatment, use of tobacco and alcohol, educational qualification, employment status, monthly income, side effects, financial assistance in treatment, social support, knowledge about medicine and disease, concomitant drug burden, polypharmacy, physician patient interaction, patient educational sessions and prevalence of depression. Seventy five percent of patients were found to be adherent. On univariate analysis, prevalence of depression (p<0.000001), moderate severe depression (p<0.000001), concomitant drug burden (p=0.036) and monthly income (p=0.015) were found to be significantly influencing adherence. The final multivariate model retained prevalence of depression with OR= 10.367 (95% CI, 3.112-34.538) as independent predictor of adherence to therapy. This study suggests that identification and treatment of depression among CML patients may further enhance adherence to IM therapy.","['Kapoor, Jyotsna', 'Agrawal, Narendra', 'Ahmed, Rayaz', 'Sharma, Sanjeev Kumar', 'Gupta, Anshul', 'Bhurani, Dinesh']","['Kapoor J', 'Agrawal N', 'Ahmed R', 'Sharma SK', 'Gupta A', 'Bhurani D']","['Masters in Clinical Research, Department of Hematology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector - 5, Rohini, Delhi, India.

Therefore, we investigated the expression and prognostic impact of Hedgehog pathway members in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pretreatment samples from 104 newly diagnosed AML patients (AMLSG 07-04 trial) were analyzed by qPCR, and expression of Hedgehog family members was correlated with clinical outcome. Inhibition of GLI by GANT61 or shRNA was investigated in AML cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Expression of receptors Smoothened and Patched-1 and their downstream mediators, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3, was found in AML patients in contrast to Hedgehog ligands. GLI2 expression had a significant negative influence on event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS; P = 0.037, 0.026, and 0.013, respectively) and was correlated with FLT3 mutational status (P < 0.001). Analysis of a second, independent patient cohort confirmed the negative impact of GLI2 on EFS and OS (P = 0.007 and 0.003, respectively; n = 290). Within this cohort, GLI1 had a negative prognostic impact (P < 0.001 for both EFS and OS). Although AML cells did not express Hedgehog ligands by qPCR, AML patients had significantly increased Desert Hedgehog (DHH) plasma levels compared with healthy subjects (P = 0.002), in whom DHH was presumably provided by bone marrow niche cells. Moreover, the GLI inhibitor GANT61 or knockdown of GLI1/2 by shRNA caused antileukemic effects, including induction of apoptosis, reduced proliferation, and colony formation in AML cells, and a survival benefit in mice. CONCLUSIONS: GLI expression is a negative prognostic factor and might represent a novel druggable target in AML.","['Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Latuske, Emily', 'Kohler, Julian', 'Wagner, Katharina', 'Stamm, Hauke', 'Vettorazzi, Eik', 'Vohwinkel, Gabi', 'Klokow, Marianne', 'Uibeleisen, Roswitha', 'Ehm, Patrick', 'Riecken, Kristoffer', 'Loges, Sonja', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Schubert, Claudia', 'Amling, Michael', 'Jucker, Manfred', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Wellbrock J', 'Latuske E', 'Kohler J', 'Wagner K', 'Stamm H', 'Vettorazzi E', 'Vohwinkel G', 'Klokow M', 'Uibeleisen R', 'Ehm P', 'Riecken K', 'Loges S', 'Thol F', 'Schubert C', 'Amling M', 'Jucker M', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Heuser M', 'Krauter J', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.

Targeting CDK4/CDK6 in combination with cytotoxic killing therefore represents a rational approach to cancer therapy. By selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with PD 0332991, which leads to early G1 arrest and synchronous S-phase entry upon release of the G1 block, we have developed a novel strategy to prime acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells for cytotoxic killing by cytarabine (Ara-C). This sensitization is achieved in part through enrichment of S-phase cells, which maximizes the AML populations for Ara-C incorporation into replicating DNA to elicit DNA damage. Moreover, PD 0332991 triggered apoptosis of AML cells through inhibition of the homeobox (HOX)A9 oncogene expression, reducing the transcription of its target PIM1. Reduced PIM1 synthesis attenuates PIM1-mediated phosphorylation of the proapoptotic BAD and activates BAD-dependent apoptosis. In vivo, timely inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 by PD 0332991 and release profoundly suppresses tumor growth in response to reduced doses of Ara-C in a xenograft AML model. Collectively, these data suggest selective and reversible inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 as an effective means to enhance Ara-C killing of AML cells at reduced doses, which has implications for the treatment of elderly AML patients who are unable to tolerate high-dose Ara-C therapy.","['Yang, Chenyi', 'Boyson, Cynthia A', 'Di Liberto, Maurizio', 'Huang, Xiangao', 'Hannah, Jeffrey', 'Dorn, David C', 'Moore, Malcolm A S', 'Chen-Kiang, Selina', 'Zhou, Pengbo']","['Yang C', 'Boyson CA', 'Di Liberto M', 'Huang X', 'Hannah J', 'Dorn DC', 'Moore MA', 'Chen-Kiang S', 'Zhou P']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York. pez2001@med.cornell.edu sckiang@med.cornell.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York. pez2001@med.cornell.edu sckiang@med.cornell.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150305,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4417369,2015/03/07 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/03/07 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-14-2486 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2486 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2015 May 1;75(9):1838-45. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2486.

Although the etiology of RS3PE syndrome is still unknown, several putative associations with malignancies and hematological disorders have been reported. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is characterized by infective hematopoiesis with possible transformation to leukemia; however, an association between RS3PE syndrome and MDS has been rarely reported. Here, we describe a 67-year-old man with MDS with refractory anemia who developed RS3PE syndrome 3 months after the diagnosis of MDS. The patient presented with polyarthritis with pitting edema at the dorsum of the hands, the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein and a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6, and the elevated plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of RS3PE syndrome. Treatment with low doses of corticosteroids resulted in the regression of polyarthritis and pitting edema of the dorsum of the hands, as well as a reduction in the elevated levels of plasma VEGF. Partial resolution of refractory anemia was also observed with steroid therapy. In summary, RS3PE syndrome developed shortly after MDS was identified in this patient. The sequence of clinical events suggests that MDS-mediated immunological abnormalities including inflammatory cytokine induction may be responsible for the association between MDS and RS3PE syndrome. Patients with RS3PE syndrome should be screened for hematological disorders that promote proinflammatory mediators.","['Matsunaga, Takafumi', 'Izumi, Yasumori', 'Iwanaga, Nozomi', 'Kawahara, Chieko', 'Shigemitsu, Yoshika', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Kawakami, Atsushi', 'Ogawa, Daisuke', 'Migita, Kiyoshi']","['Matsunaga T', 'Izumi Y', 'Iwanaga N', 'Kawahara C', 'Shigemitsu Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Kawakami A', 'Ogawa D', 'Migita K']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, Nagasaki Medical Center.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Edema/*complications', 'Hand/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Radiography', 'Syndrome', 'Synovitis/*complications']",,2015/03/07 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/07 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.235.47 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2015 Jan;235(1):47-52. doi: 10.1620/tjem.235.47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although prelamin A is proposed to interfere with DNA repair, our understanding of the crosstalk between prelamin A and the repair process remains limited. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) have emerged as key players in the DDR and are known to enhance ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) activity at DNA lesions, and in this study, we identified a novel relationship between prelamin A accumulation and ERK1/2 nuclear compartmentalisation during VSMC ageing. We show both prelamin A accumulation and increased DNA damage occur concomitantly, before VSMC replicative senescence, and induce the localisation of ERK1/2 to promyelocytic leukaemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs) at the sites of DNA damage via nesprin-2 and lamin A interactions. Importantly, VSMCs treated with DNA damaging agents also displayed prelamin A accumulation and ERK compartmentalisation at PML NBs, suggesting that prelamin A and nesprin-2 are novel components of the DDR. In support of this, disruption of ERK compartmentalisation at PML NBs, by either depletion of nesprin-2 or lamins A/C, resulted in the loss of ATM from DNA lesions. However, ATM signalling and DNA repair remained intact after lamins A/C depletion, whereas nesprin-2 disruption ablated downstream Chk2 activation and induced genomic instability. We conclude that lamins A/C and PML act as scaffolds to organise DNA-repair foci and compartmentalise nesprin-2/ERK signalling. However, nesprin-2/ERK signalling fidelity, but not their compartmentalisation at PML NBs, is essential for efficient DDR in VSMCs.","['Warren, D T', 'Tajsic, T', 'Porter, L J', 'Minaisah, R M', 'Cobb, A', 'Jacob, A', 'Rajgor, D', 'Zhang, Q P', 'Shanahan, C M']","['Warren DT', 'Tajsic T', 'Porter LJ', 'Minaisah RM', 'Cobb A', 'Jacob A', 'Rajgor D', 'Zhang QP', 'Shanahan CM']","[""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""Department of Medicine, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150306,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SYNE2 protein, human)', '0 (prelamin A)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/metabolism', 'Lamin Type A/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Young Adult']",PMC4532777,2015/03/07 06:00,2016/06/03 06:00,['2015/03/07 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201512 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.12 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2015 Sep;22(9):1540-50. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.12.

An exceedingly prolonged mitosis, however, promotes cell death and by this means antimicrotubule cancer drugs (AMCDs), that impair spindle assembly, are believed to kill cancer cells. Despite malformed spindles, cancer cells can, however, slip through SAC, exit mitosis prematurely and resist killing. We show here that the Fcp1 phosphatase and Wee1, the cyclin B-dependent kinase (cdk) 1 inhibitory kinase, play a role for this slippage/resistance mechanism. During AMCD-induced prolonged mitosis, Fcp1-dependent Wee1 reactivation lowered cdk1 activity, weakening SAC-dependent mitotic arrest and leading to mitosis exit and survival. Conversely, genetic or chemical Wee1 inhibition strengthened the SAC, further extended mitosis, reduced antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 to a minimum and potentiated killing in several, AMCD-treated cancer cell lines and primary human adult lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Thus, the Fcp1-Wee1-Cdk1 (FWC) axis affects SAC robustness and AMCDs sensitivity.","['Visconti, R', 'Della Monica, R', 'Palazzo, L', ""D'Alessio, F"", 'Raia, M', 'Improta, S', 'Villa, M R', 'Del Vecchio, L', 'Grieco, D']","['Visconti R', 'Della Monica R', 'Palazzo L', ""D'Alessio F"", 'Raia M', 'Improta S', 'Villa MR', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Grieco D']","['1] CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate, Gaetano Salvatore 486, Naples 80145, Italy [2] IEOS, CNR, S.

The Rai and Binet staging systems have been well recognized as standards for assessing the treatment requirements and overall survival in CLL patients. However, there is a need to seek newer prognostic markers to identify stable or progressive forms of CLL that will facilitate risk-adapted treatment strategies. Currently a molecular biomarker ZAP-70 has attracted interest as providing prognostic information in CLL patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of ZAP-70 positivity in B-CLL patients at disease presentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2011 to September 2014, 89 patients were diagnosed to have chronic lymphoid leukemia. Complete blood count was done on an automated analyzer (Cell Dyne, Abott Architect, USA), while immunophenotyping was conducted for each patient to establish the diagnosis of the disease. ZAP-70 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Data were compiled and analyzed by SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Out of the total of 89 B-CLL patients, 62 (69.7%) were male and 27 (30.3%) were females with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The mean age was 57.5+/-12.1 years. The frequency of ZAP-70 positivity in our B-CLL patients was found to be 13.5%. ZAP- 70 positivity was significantly correlated with stage III disease and high absolute lymphocytic count (P<0.05). No correlation of ZAP-70 could be established with age and gender (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of ZAP-70 in our patients appears low. It is approximately half that in international data. We would recommend to screen all the newly diagnosed patients with CLL for ZAP-70 protein expression for risk stratification, family counseling and to predict overall survival.","['Zeeshan, Rozina', 'Irfan, Syed Mohammed', 'Sultan, Sadia', 'Bhimani, Sanjana']","['Zeeshan R', 'Irfan SM', 'Sultan S', 'Bhimani S']","['Department of Hematology, Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan E-mail : rozina.ismail@lnh.edu.pk.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",,2015/03/07 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/07 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.4.1587 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(4):1587-90. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.4.1587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For prevention and control of disease, knowledge of population statistics of cancers and their trends is essential. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and trends of cancer in the province of Kerman: southeast of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analytical and cross-sectional study was carried out based on cancer registry data at the Disease Management Center of the Health Ministry from 2004 to 2009 in the province of Kerman in Iran. Common cancers were defined as the number of reported cases and standardized incidence rates. To compute the annual percentage change (APC), joinpoint 4.1.1.1 software was applied. RESULTS: Of 10,595 registered cases, 45.3% (4802 cases) were in women and 56.7% (5,793 cases) occurred in men. The standardized incidence rates for both females and males were increasing during the six years studied. The most common cancers in both sexes during six years of studied were skin (13.4%), breast (9.35%), bladder (7.8%), stomach (7.45%), leukemia (7.05%), colorectal(5.57%), lung(4.92%), trachea(3.51%) and prostate(2.48%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that the cancer incidence is demonstrating increasing trends in both sexes in the province of Kerman.

In this study, anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of the derivatives from the spiroquinazolinone family were investigated in the human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. The K562 cells were treated with various concentrations of the spiroquinazolinone (10-300 microM) for 3 days and cell viability was determined by MTT growth inhibition assay. 4t-QTC was more active among these compounds with IC50 of 50 +/- 3.6 microM and was selected for further studies. Apoptosis, as the mechanism of cell death was investigated morphologically by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) double staining, cell surface expression assay of phosphatidyl serine by Annexin V/PI technique, as well as the formation of DNA ladder. The K562 cells underwent apoptosis upon a single dose (at IC50 value) of the 4t-QTC compound, and over-expressed caspase-3 expression by more than 1.7-fold, following a 72 hr treatment. Furthermore, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of the K562 cells with 4t-QTC down-regulates and up-regulates the expression of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) and Bax (pro-apoptotic), respectively. Based on the present data, it seems that these compounds from the spiroquinazolinone family are good candidates for further evaluation as an effective chemotherapeutic family acting through induction of apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Ghasemian, Majid', 'Mahdavi, Majid', 'Zare, Payman', 'Ali Hosseinpour Feizi, Mohammad']","['Ghasemian M', 'Mahdavi M', 'Zare P', 'Ali Hosseinpour Feizi M']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '157075-58-6 (spiroquinazoline)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics/*metabolism']",,2015/03/07 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2015/03/07 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2131/jts.40.115 [doi]'],ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 2015 Feb;40(1):115-26. doi: 10.2131/jts.40.115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism through which CBFbeta-SMMHC contributes to leukemia development is not well understood. Previously, it was proposed that CBFbeta-SMMHC acts by dominantly repressing the transcription factor RUNX1 (Runt-related protein 1), but we recently showed that CBFbeta-SMMHC has activities that are independent of RUNX1 repression. In addition, we showed that a modified CBFbeta-SMMHC with decreased RUNX1-binding activity accelerates leukemogenesis. These results raise questions about the importance of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis by CBFbeta-SMMHC. To test this, we generated mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 in a Runx1-deficient background, resulting from either homozygous Runx1-null alleles (Runx1(-/-)) or a single dominant-negative Runx1 allele (Runx1(+/lz)). We found that loss of Runx1 activity rescued the differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11 during primitive hematopoiesis. During definitive hematopoiesis, RUNX1 loss also significantly reduced the proliferation and differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11. Importantly, Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemia had much longer latency in Runx1(+/lz) mice than in Runx1-sufficient mice. These data indicate that Runx1 activity is critical for Cbfb-MYH11-induced hematopoietic defects and leukemogenesis.","['Hyde, R K', 'Zhao, L', 'Alemu, L', 'Liu, P P']","['Hyde RK', 'Zhao L', 'Alemu L', 'Liu PP']","['Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20150306,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (myosin 11, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*physiology']",PMC4526349,2015/03/07 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201558 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.58 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1771-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.58.

LTHSCs from OB-ablated mice demonstrated loss of quiescence and reduced long-term engraftment and self-renewal capacity. Ablation of OB in a transgenic CML mouse model resulted in accelerated leukemia development with reduced survival compared with control mice. The notch ligand Jagged-1 was overexpressed on CML OBs. Normal and CML LTHSCs cultured with Jagged-1 demonstrated reduced cell cycling, consistent with a possible role for loss of Jagged-1 signals in altered HSC and LSC function after OB ablation.

These 'RASopathies' also represent cancer-prone syndromes, but the quantitative cancer risks remain unknown. METHODS: We investigated the occurrence of childhood cancer including benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system in a group of 735 individuals with germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes by matching their information with the German Childhood Cancer Registry. RESULTS: We observed 12 cases of cancer in the entire RASopathy cohort vs 1.12 expected (based on German population-based incidence rates). This corresponds to a 10.5-fold increased risk of all childhood cancers combined (standardised incidence ratio (SIR)=10.5, 95% confidence interval=5.4-18.3). The specific cancers included juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia=4; brain tumour=3; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia=2; rhabdomyosarcoma=2; and neuroblastoma=1. The childhood cancer SIR in Noonan syndrome patients was 8.1, whereas that for Costello syndrome patients was 42.4. CONCLUSIONS: These data comprise the first quantitative evidence documenting that the germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes are associated with increased risks of both childhood leukaemia

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 449 consecutive MM patients seen at our institute in 2010-2012 to assess indications for RT as well as its effectiveness. Pain response was scored similarly to RTOG 0631 and used the Numerical Rating Pain Scale. RESULTS: Among 442 evaluable patients, 149 (34%) patients and 262 sites received RT. The most common indication for RT was palliation of bone pain (n = 109, 42%), followed by prevention/treatment of pathological fractures (n = 73, 28%), spinal cord compression (n = 26, 10%), and involvement of vital organs/extramedullary disease (n = 25, 10%). Of the 55 patients evaluable for pain relief, complete and partial responses were obtained in 76.4 and 7.2%, respectively. Prior RT did not significantly decrease the median number of peripheral blood stem cells collected for autologous transplant, even when prior RT was given to both the spine and pelvis. Inadequacy of stem cell collection for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) was not significantly different and it occurred in 9 and 15% of patients receiving no RT and spine/pelvic RT, respectively. None of the three cases of therapy-induced acute myelogenous leukemia/MDS occurred in the RT group. CONCLUSION: Despite the introduction of novel effective agents in the treatment of MM, RT remains a major therapeutic component for the management in 34% of patients, and it effectively provides pain relief while not interfering with successful peripheral blood stem cell collection for ASCT.","['Talamo, Giampaolo', 'Dimaio, Christopher', 'Abbi, Kamal K S', 'Pandey, Manoj K', 'Malysz, Jozef', 'Creer, Michael H', 'Zhu, Junjia', 'Mir, Muhammad A', 'Varlotto, John M']","['Talamo G', 'Dimaio C', 'Abbi KK', 'Pandey MK', 'Malysz J', 'Creer MH', 'Zhu J', 'Mir MA', 'Varlotto JM']","['Penn State Milton S.

Supplementation with its metabolic precursor citrulline (Cit) is more effective at improving skeletal muscle Arg concentrations. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that Cit supplementation would attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy and loss of function during hindlimb immobilization in mice. METHODS: Male C57BL/6JArc mice underwent 14 d of unilateral hindlimb immobilization/plaster casting and were supplemented with ~0.81 g Cit . kg(-)(1) . d(-)(1) (CIT group) or Ala (ALA group) mixed into their food. The uncasted contralateral limb (internal control) and an uncasted group (CON) served as controls. Muscle atrophy was evaluated with mass, fiber area, and in situ muscle function. RESULTS: Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle mass [ALA: 37.6 +/- 0.92 mg; CIT: 38.3 +/- 1.25 mg] and peak tetanic force (ALA: 1150 +/- 38.5 mN; CIT: 1150 +/- 52.0 mN) were lower (P < 0.001) in the ALA (53.9 +/- 0.42 mg) and CIT (1760 +/- 28.5 mN) groups than in the CON group. No difference was found between ALA and CIT groups for TA mass, fiber area, or peak force. The mRNA expression of the nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible (Nos2; ~15-fold) and B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (Bnip3; ~17-fold) genes and the ratio of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3BII to 3BI (LC3BII:LC3BI) (50.5% +/- 17.7%) were higher (P < 0.05) in the ALA group than in the CON group, suggesting increased autophagy. In the CIT group, Bnip3 mRNA was lower (-70%; P < 0.05) and Nos2 mRNA tended to be lower (-45%; P = 0.05) than in the ALA group, whereas LC3BII:LC3BI was not different from the CON group.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Our data reveal a reciprocal expression pattern of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB4 in proliferative and ERBB2/ERBB3 in invasive trophoblast subtypes, as well as a restricted responsiveness to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: EGFR is expressed by villous cytotrophoblasts (vCTBs), but absent from extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which specifically up-regulate ERBB2. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Tissue samples of human first trimester placentae (n = 50) and deciduae (n = 5) obtained from elective pregnancy terminations were used to study trophoblast subtype-specific ERBB receptor expression and responsiveness to recombinant human EGF and HB-EGF. Age-matched complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) placentae (n = 12) were assessed for EGFR and ERBB4 expression in proliferation-competent regions. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: ERBB receptor expression was analysed in primary trophoblast cell isolates by means of microarray, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting, as well as immunofluorescence stainings of placental and decidual tissue sections. EGF and HB-EGF were tested for their potential to activate ERBB receptors in purified EGFR(+) and HLA-G(+) trophoblasts. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays were performed to study the effect of both ligands on the proliferative capacity of primary trophoblasts as well as of vCTBs and proximal cell column trophoblasts (pCCTs) in placental floating explants. Finally, the average number of EGFR(+) vCTB and pCCT layers was determined in CHM placentae and compared with healthy age-matched controls. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Proliferative vCTBs and pCCTs co-express EGFR and ERBB4, but are devoid of ERBB2 and ERBB3. In contrast, HLA-G(+) trophoblast subtypes exhibit an EGFR/ERBB4(-) and ERBB2/ERBB3(+) phenotype. EGF and HB-EGF activate EGFR, ERBB4, AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in EGFR(+) primary trophoblasts; however, they do not show an effect on HLA-G(+) EVTs. Both ligands strongly induce cell cycle progression in primary trophoblasts (P < 0.05) and placental explant-associated vCTBs (P < 0.05) and pCCTs (P < 0.05). Notably, EGFR(+) vCTB (P < 0.0001) and pCCT (P < 0.0001) layers are significantly expanded in CHM placentae when compared with healthy controls. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Cells were removed from their physiological context and may therefore respond differently to various stimuli. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In this study we define EGFR as a marker for proliferative trophoblast subtypes within the human placenta. Manipulation of EGFR signalling might thus offer a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of molar pregnancies associated with trophoblast hyperplasia.

The pathogenesis of MLL-fusion leukemias has been linked to upregulation of HOX/MEIS1 genes. The functions of the Hox/Meis1 complex in leukemia, however, remain elusive. Here, we used inducible Meis1-knockout mice coupled with MLL-AF9 knockin mice to decipher the mechanistic role of Meis1 in established MLL leukemia. We demonstrate that Meis1 is essential for maintenance of established leukemia. In addition, in both the murine model and human leukemia cells, we found that Meis1 loss led to increased oxidative stress, oxygen flux, and apoptosis. Gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) as a target gene of Meis1. Hypoxia or HLF expression reversed the oxidative stress, rescuing leukemia development in Meis1-deficient cells. Thus, the leukemia-promoting properties of Meis1 are at least partly mediated by a low-oxidative state, aided by HLF. These results suggest that stimulants of oxidative metabolism could have therapeutic potential in leukemia treatment.","['Roychoudhury, Jayeeta', 'Clark, Jason P', 'Gracia-Maldonado, Gabriel', 'Unnisa, Zeenath', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Link, Kevin A', 'Dasgupta, Nupur', 'Aronow, Bruce', 'Huang, Gang', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Kumar, Ashish R']","['Roychoudhury J', 'Clark JP', 'Gracia-Maldonado G', 'Unnisa Z', 'Wunderlich M', 'Link KA', 'Dasgupta N', 'Aronow B', 'Huang G', 'Mulloy JC', 'Kumar AR']","['Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology.', 'Division of Human Genetics, and.', ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150304,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9LSH52S3LQ (Dichloroacetic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Dichloroacetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Oxidative Stress', 'RNA Interference', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",PMC4400291,2015/03/06 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/03/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31793-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-599258 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 16;125(16):2544-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-599258.

We screened BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing in 30 CML patients including 22 resistant patients and 8 patients with optimal response to imatinib. Three mutations of two different types were identified in 3 of 22 (13.6%) resistant patients. Two patients had p.E355G mutation in the catalytic domain, and the third patient had p.G398R in the activation loop that is reported here for the first time. No mutation was found in patients with optimal response to imatinib. The frequency of mutations was similar in patients with primary resistance compared with patients with secondary resistance (25 vs 11%; P=1). Mutation status had no impact on the overall survival and progression-free survival. p.E355G mutation was correlated with shorter survival (P=0.047) in resistant patients.

When pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G glycoprotein, the retroviruses can infect a broad range of proliferative axolotl cell types.

So far, about 80 different direct MLL fusions and about 120 reciprocal MLL fusions have been characterized at the molecular level. The common theme in these leukemia-associated genetic rearrangements is the genetic disruption of the MLL gene. This leads to MLL-X fusion proteins that still bind to nuclear factors (e.g., MEN1, LEDGF), which in turn allow them to target promoters and cause ectopic gene transcription. In addition, the most frequent MLL fusions (MLL-AF4, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, and MLL-ENL) are all recruiting the wild-type AF4 multiprotein complex that contains the target proteins P-TEFb, BRD4, and DOT1L. Vice versa, reciprocal X-MLL fusions exhibit a PHD domain (H3K4me3 reader domain), sequester the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP and MOF1 and bear a histone methyltransferase domain at their very C-terminus (SET domain). Except for AF4-MLL, the functional consequences deriving from reciprocal fusion proteins are not very well understood. However, based on our knowledge about the above-mentioned MLL fusions, it is reasonable to inhibit their oncogenic activity in a targeted fashion.

Deregulation of c-Myb has been implicated in the development of leukemia and certain other types of human cancer. c-Myb activity is highly dependent on the interaction of the c-Myb with the KIX domain of the coactivator p300, making the disruption of this interaction a reasonable strategy for the development of Myb inhibitors. Here, we have used bacterial Autodisplay to develop an in vitro binding assay that mimics the interaction of Myb and the KIX domain of p300. We have used this binding assay to investigate the potential of Naphthol AS-E phosphate, a compound known to bind to the KIX domain, to disrupt the interaction between Myb and p300. Our data show that Naphthol AS-E phosphate interferes with the Myb-KIX interaction in vitro and inhibits Myb activity in vivo. By using several human leukemia cell lines, we demonstrate that Naphthol AS-E phosphate suppresses the expression of Myb target genes and induces myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Our work identifies Naphthol AS-E phosphate as the first low molecular weight compound that inhibits Myb activity by disrupting its interaction with p300, and suggests that inhibition of the Myb-KIX interaction might be a useful strategy for the treatment of leukemia and other tumors caused by deregulated c-Myb.","['Uttarkar, Sagar', 'Dukare, Sandeep', 'Bopp, Bertan', 'Goblirsch, Michael', 'Jose, Joachim', 'Klempnauer, Karl-Heinz']","['Uttarkar S', 'Dukare S', 'Bopp B', 'Goblirsch M', 'Jose J', 'Klempnauer KH']","['Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Germany.

L-Asparaginase is one such well known chemotherapeutic agent that has enhanced the survival rates to 90 % in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for past 30 years. But the use of this enzyme is accompanied by hypersensitive reactions ranging from allergy to anaphylactic shock which have a drastic influence in treatment outcomes. Numerous attempts have been made to minimize the problems of immunogenicity, which remained as a major bottleneck in the treatment protocols. Conjugating the enzyme L- Asparaginase with PEG was successful as it has reduced the complications in therapy and frequency of injections (dosages), and thus became prominent in reducing the immunogenicity up to a certain extent. Keeping the bottlenecks in consideration during the development of therapeutics, the present study concentrates on engineering of protein as an alternative to the PEGylated enzyme, having reduced immunogenicity as an inbuilt character of protein by using in silico approaches. L-Asparaginase from Escherichia coli and Pectobacterium carotovorum were selected for the present study. The methodology consists of (i) locating the B and CD4+ T cell epitopes of enzyme by in silico tools (ii) generating point mutations of these epitopes to alter or reduce the immunogenicity of protein (iii) generating enzyme models by molecular modelling (iv) assessing the binding affinity of the substrate with L-Asparaginase variants by in silico docking methods using Autodock 4.2 and (v) validating the mutated model for stability by molecular dynamics simulation studies using Gromacs.","['Ramya, L N', 'Pulicherla, Krishna Kanth']","['Ramya LN', 'Pulicherla KK']","['Department of Biotechnology, Acharya Nagarjuna University, Nagarjuna Nagar, Guntur, 522510, A.P., India, nagramya@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150306,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/*deficiency/immunology', 'Asparaginase/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/immunology', '*Enzyme Therapy', 'Epitopes/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Pectobacterium carotovorum/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/immunology/*therapy', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2015/03/06 06:00,2016/07/01 06:00,['2015/03/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-015-9912-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2015 Sep;21(4):909-20. doi: 10.1007/s12253-015-9912-0.

However, in vivo evidence of the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties by p63 is still limited. Here, we exploit the transgenic MMTV-ErbB2 (v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) mouse model of carcinogenesis to dissect the role of p63 in the regulation of mammary CSC self-renewal and breast tumorigenesis. ErbB2 tumor cells enriched for SC-like properties display increased levels of DeltaNp63 expression compared with normal mammary progenitors. Down-regulation of p63 in ErbB2 mammospheres markedly restricts self-renewal and expansion of CSCs, and this action is fully independent of p53. Furthermore, transplantation of ErbB2 progenitors expressing shRNAs against p63 into the mammary fat pads of syngeneic mice delays tumor growth in vivo. p63 knockdown in ErbB2 progenitors diminishes the expression of genes encoding components of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a driver of mammary SC self-renewal. Remarkably, p63 regulates the expression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), GLI family zinc finger 2 (Gli2), and Patched1 (Ptch1) genes by directly binding to their gene regulatory regions, and eventually contributes to pathway activation. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of p63 in maintaining the self-renewal potential of mammary CSCs via a positive modulation of the Hh signaling pathway.","['Memmi, Elisa Maria', 'Sanarico, Anna Giulia', 'Giacobbe, Arianna', 'Peschiaroli, Angelo', 'Frezza, Valentina', 'Cicalese, Angelo', 'Pisati, Federica', 'Tosoni, Daniela', 'Zhou, Huiqing', 'Tonon, Giovanni', 'Antonov, Alexey', 'Melino, Gerry', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Bernassola, Francesca']","['Memmi EM', 'Sanarico AG', 'Giacobbe A', 'Peschiaroli A', 'Frezza V', 'Cicalese A', 'Pisati F', 'Tosoni D', 'Zhou H', 'Tonon G', 'Antonov A', 'Melino G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Bernassola F']","['Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" 00133 Rome, Italy;', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" 00133 Rome, Italy;', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" 00133 Rome, Italy;', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Institute of Cellular Biology and Neurobiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, 00015 Rome, Italy;', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" 00133 Rome, Italy;', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy;', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM) of the Italian Foundation for Cancer Research (FIRC), 20139 Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Molecular Developmental Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, and Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands;', 'Functional Genomics of Cancer Unit, Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy;', 'Medical Research Council, Toxicology Unit, Leicester University, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom; and.', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" 00133 Rome, Italy; Medical Research Council, Toxicology Unit, Leicester University, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom; and melino@uniroma2.it piergiuseppe.pelicci@ieo.eu bernasso@uniroma2.it.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy; Department of Health Sciences, Milan University, 20142 Milan, Italy melino@uniroma2.it piergiuseppe.pelicci@ieo.eu bernasso@uniroma2.it.', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" 00133 Rome, Italy; Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy; melino@uniroma2.it piergiuseppe.pelicci@ieo.eu bernasso@uniroma2.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150304,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Shh protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Trp63 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4372004,2015/03/06 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2015/03/06 06:00'],"['2015/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1500762112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1500762112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Mar 17;112(11):3499-504. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1500762112.

Among the various formats of bispecific antibodies developed in the past 50 years, the BiTE class is remarkable for its low effector-to-target ratio, high tissue penetration and singular ability to activate T cells independent of MHC class I presentation or costimulation. Blinatumomab has been studied in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the current literature on blinatumomab including its pharmacology, preclinical findings, clinical trials in B-cell NHL and, to a lesser extent, Phase II studies in B-ALL. The authors discuss the potential future directions in light of other new competing therapies for NHL and unmet clinical needs in the market. EXPERT OPINION: The recent approval of blinatumomab for B-ALL symbolizes a breakthrough for BiTE technology with prospective application in the targeted therapy of other cancers. Although blinatumomab seems an unlikely option for treating indolent lymphoma due to toxicity, the need for long-term continuous infusion therapy and multiple promising well-tolerated oral agents, it holds promise for aggressive NHL patients whose diseases are refractory to current standard approaches. Larger trials are needed to demonstrate blinatumomab's curative potential in aggressive histologies.","['Oak, Eunhye', 'Bartlett, Nancy L']","['Oak E', 'Bartlett NL']","['Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology , St. Louis, MO , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150304,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology']",,2015/03/06 06:00,2016/01/02 06:00,['2015/03/06 06:00'],"['2015/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2015.1021415 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2015 May;24(5):715-24. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2015.1021415.

Results showed that As2O3 combined with ACM exerted a synergistic cytotoxic effect by activation of the apoptosis pathway. Additionally, we found that the combination treatment decreased Bcl-2, c-IAP and XIAP expression but increased SMAC and caspase-3 expression more significantly than the single drug treatments. Furthermore, combination index (CI) values were < 1 in all matched combination groups.

Although demoralization and posttraumatic growth are both related to meaning-making, little attention has been paid to the associations among these concepts. The current study investigated the relationship between demoralization, posttraumatic growth, and meaning-making (focusing on sense-making and benefit-finding during the experience of illness) in cancer patients. METHOD: Some 200 cancer patients (with lung cancer, lymphoma, or leukemia) at the MacKay Memorial Hospital in New Taipei completed the Demoralization Scale-Mandarin Version (DS-MV), the Chinese Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (CPTGI), and a self-designed questionnaire for assessing sense-making and benefit-finding. RESULTS: Demoralization was negatively correlated with posttraumatic growth, sense-making, benefit-finding, and time-since-diagnosis. Multiple regression analysis showed that meaning-making had different effects on demoralization and posttraumatic growth. The interactions of sense-making with either benefit-finding or time-since-diagnosis significantly predicted demoralization. Individuals with relatively higher sense-making and benefit-finding or shorter time-since-diagnosis experienced less demoralization. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The suffering of cancer may turn on the psychological process of demoralization, posttraumatic growth, and meaning-making in patients. Cancer patients who evidenced higher posttraumatic growth experienced less demoralization. Trying to identify positive changes in the experience of cancer may be a powerful way to increase posttraumatic growth. As time goes by, patients experienced less demoralization. Facilitating sense-making can have similar effects. Cancer patients with less benefit-finding experience higher demoralization, but sense-making buffers this effect.","['Li, Yu-Chan', 'Yeh, Pei-Chen', 'Chen, Hong-Wen', 'Chang, Yi-Fang', 'Pi, Shih-Hsuan', 'Fang, Chun-Kai']","['Li YC', 'Yeh PC', 'Chen HW', 'Chang YF', 'Pi SH', 'Fang CK']","['Department of Thanatology and Health Counseling,National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences,Taipei,Taiwan.', 'Department of Thanatology and Health Counseling,National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences,Taipei,Taiwan.', 'MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing, and Management,Taipei,Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology,MacKay Memorial Hospital,Taipei and New Taipei,Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research,MacKay Memorial Hospital,Taipei,Taiwan.', 'Department of Thanatology and Health Counseling,National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences,Taipei,Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150305,England,Palliat Support Care,Palliative & supportive care,101232529,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Depressive Disorder/etiology/*psychology', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Regression Analysis', '*Resilience, Psychological', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Taiwan', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/06 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/03/06 06:00'],"['2015/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1478951515000048 [pii]', '10.1017/S1478951515000048 [doi]']",ppublish,Palliat Support Care. 2015 Oct;13(5):1449-58. doi: 10.1017/S1478951515000048.

A recent report suggested a substantial decline in the early, or 1-month, mortality rate in patients treated on clinical trials over the past 2 decades. It is unknown whether a similar improvement has been observed in the general population. METHODS: The authors examined the 1-month mortality rate in a large population-based series of 9380 patients with AML who were aged </= 65 years and were diagnosed and treated with chemotherapy between 1973 and 2010. RESULTS: A significant decline was observed in the 1-month mortality rate from 18.7% among patients diagnosed from 1973 through 1977 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 16.4%-21.2%) to 5.8% for those diagnosed between 2008 and 2010 (95% CI, 4.5%-7.6%) (P <.001). The median overall survival improved significantly from 6 months (95% CI, 5 months-7 months) in 1973 to 1977 to 23 months (95% CI, 16 months-20 months) in 2008 to 2010 (P <.001). Although age and geographic variation were found to significantly influence the 1-month mortality for the period between 1973 and 1977, these differences in 1-month mortality were no longer significant among patients with AML who were treated more recently (2008-2010). CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 4 decades, early mortality has become uncommon in younger patients (aged </= 65 years) with newly diagnosed AML undergoing induction chemotherapy. It is encouraging that the improvements noted in 1-month mortality rate among a selective cohort of patients in clinical trials have also been observed in a population-based analysis.","['Percival, Mary-Elizabeth M', 'Tao, Li', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Clarke, Christina A']","['Percival ME', 'Tao L', 'Medeiros BC', 'Clarke CA']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150304,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4465209,2015/03/06 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/03/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29319 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jun 15;121(12):2004-12. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29319.

Also, ART possesses anticancer potential albeit through incompletely understood molecular mechanism(s). Here, the effect of ART on various protein kinases, associated gene products, cellular response, and apoptosis was investigated. The in vivo effect of ART on the growth of human CML xenograft tumors in athymic nu/nu mice was also examined. In our preliminary experiments, we first observed that phosphorylation of p38, ERK, CREB, Chk-2, STAT5, and RSK proteins were suppressed upon ART exposure. Interestingly, ART induced the expression of SOCS-1 protein and depletion of SOCS-1 using siRNA abrogated the STAT5 inhibitory effect of the drug. Also various dephosphorylations caused by ART led to the suppression of various survival gene products and induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. Moreover, ART also substantially potentiated the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, when administered intraperitoneally, ART inhibited p38, ERK, STAT5, and CREB activation in tumor tissues and the growth of human CML xenograft tumors in mice without exhibiting any significant adverse effects. Overall, our results suggest that ART exerts its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects through suppression of multiple signaling cascades in CML both in vitro and in vivo.","['Kim, Chulwon', 'Lee, Jong Hyun', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok']","['Kim C', 'Lee JH', 'Kim SH', 'Sethi G', 'Ahn KS']","['College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 117597, Singapore.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '60W3249T9M (Artesunate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimalarials/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Artemisinins/*pharmacology', 'Artesunate', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Random Allocation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4414170,2015/03/05 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['3004 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3004 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):4020-35. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown here that asparaginase induced significant growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 and KU812 cells. Apart from induction of apoptosis, we reported for the first time that asparaginase induced autophagic response in K562 and KU812 cells as evidenced by the formation of autophagosome, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-positive autophagy-like vacuoles, and the upregulation of LC3-II. Further study suggested that the Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathway were involved in asparaginase-induced autophagy in K562 cells. Moreover, blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors LY294002, chloroquine (CQ) and quinacrine (QN) enhanced asparaginase-induced cell death and apoptosis, indicating the cytoprotective role of autophagy in asparaginase-treated K562 and KU812 cells. Together, these findings provide a rationale that combination of asparaginase anticancer activity and autophagic inhibition might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for CML.","['Song, Ping', 'Ye, Li', 'Fan, Jiajun', 'Li, Yubin', 'Zeng, Xian', 'Wang, Ziyu', 'Wang, Shaofei', 'Zhang, Guoping', 'Yang, Ping', 'Cao, Zhonglian', 'Ju, Dianwen']","['Song P', 'Ye L', 'Fan J', 'Li Y', 'Zeng X', 'Wang Z', 'Wang S', 'Zhang G', 'Yang P', 'Cao Z', 'Ju D']","['Department of Biosynthesis & The Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, 201203, P.R.

How Alloreactive Cell Therapies without Substantial Engraftment Might Treat Hematologic Cancers.,281-295,10.2174/1389450116666150304103849 [doi],"""Alloreactive cell therapy without substantial engraftment""; (ACT-WiSE) refers to adoptive transfer of natural (""non-engineered"") human leukocyte antigen-mismatched lymphocytes to mediate anti-neoplastic alloreactivity in recipients without employing pharmacologic immunosuppression. By definition, ACT-WiSE entails subsequent rejection of most, if not all, donor cells. Macrochimerism is transient and microchimerism may be either short-lived or persistent. This strategy harnesses the anticancer potency of alloreactivity without incurring significant risk of graft-versus-host disease. ""Microtransplantation"" refers to a form of ACT-WiSE where the donor cell product contains hematopoietic progenitor cells. Microtransplantation therefore accelerates hematopoietic recovery and its immunomodulatory effects may differ from other forms of ACT-WiSE. Recent studies suggest that various forms of ACT-WiSE, including microtransplantation, may improve chemosensitivity in patients with myeloid malignancies, resulting in higher complete remission rates and increased survival. Microtransplantation has also demonstrated promising pilot results in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. ACT-WiSE and microtransplantation may establish a new class of allogeneic cell therapy of particular relevance to persons not considered candidates for traditional allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). Open questions include the optimal timing and cell dose of ACT-WiSE, which donor factors contribute to efficacy, and whether these remissions are durable after eradication of donor cells. We extrapolate from lessons learned in the course of traditional and haploidentical AHCT to propose ways of optimizing ACT-WiSE. We divide these into donor-related strategies (including rational donor selection and boosting NK-cell and T-cell alloreactivity) and patient- related strategies (that may favor development of autologous NK-cell and T-cell mediated anticancer cytotoxicity in the post-ACT-WiSE window).","['Krakow, Elizabeth F', 'Ai, Hui-Sheng', 'Shaffer, Brian', 'Delisle, Jean-Sebastien', 'Hu, Kai-Xun', 'Sung, Anthony D']","['Krakow EF', 'Ai HS', 'Shaffer B', 'Delisle JS', 'Hu KX', 'Sung AD']","['Duke University Medical Center, DUMC Box 3961, Durham, NC 27710, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,IM,"['Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Chimerism', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1389450116666150304103849 [doi]', 'CDT-EPUB-65644 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2017;18(3):281-295. doi: 10.2174/1389450116666150304103849.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Alloreactivity', '*T cells', '*graft-vs-host disease', '*immunotherapy', '*leukemia', '*natural killer cells', '*transplantation', '*tumorassociated antigen.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we studied cytodifferentiation effects of newly characterized prenyl flavonoid 4'-O-methylkuwanon E (4ME) isolated from white mulberry (Morus alba L.). Main Methods. Cell growth and viability were measured by dye exclusion assay; cell cycle and surface antigen CD11b were monitored by flow cytometry. For the cytodifferentiation of cells the NBT reduction assay was employed. Regulatory proteins were assessed by western blotting. Key Findings. 4ME induced dose-dependent growth inhibition of THP-1 cells, which was not accompanied by toxic effect. Inhibition of cells proliferation caused by 4ME was associated with the accumulation in G1 phase and with downregulation of hyperphosphorylated pRb. Treatment with 4ME led to significant induction of NBT-reducing activity of PMA stimulated THP-1 cells and upregulation expression of differentiation-associated surface antigen CD11b. Our results suggest that monocytic differentiation induced by 4ME is connected with up-regulation of p38 kinase activity. Significance. Our study provides the first evidence that 4ME induces the differentiation of THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells and thus is a potential cytodifferentiating anticancer agent.","['Kollar, Peter', 'Barta, Tomas', 'Keltosova, Stanislava', 'Trnova, Pavlina', 'Muller Zavalova, Veronika', 'Smejkal, Karel', 'Hosek, Jan', 'Fedr, Radek', 'Soucek, Karel', 'Hampl, Ales']","['Kollar P', 'Barta T', 'Keltosova S', 'Trnova P', 'Muller Zavalova V', 'Smejkal K', 'Hosek J', 'Fedr R', 'Soucek K', 'Hampl A']","['Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Palackeho Trida 1-3, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 3, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic ; International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Palackeho Trida 1-3, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Palackeho Trida 1-3, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Palackeho Trida 1-3, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Palackeho Trida 1-3, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Palackeho Trida 1-3, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic ; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic."", ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic ; Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 3, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150209,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC4337268,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/03/05 06:01,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/251895 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015;2015:251895. doi: 10.1155/2015/251895.

A percentage of these type A spermatogonia then differentiate to enter meiosis as spermatocytes by approximately P10. It is currently unclear as to when these distinct populations are initially formed in the neonatal testis, and when the expression of markers both characteristic of and required for the adult undifferentiated and differentiating states is established. In this study, we compared expression of known spermatogonial cell fate markers during normal development and in response to the differentiation signal provided by retinoic acid (RA). We found that some markers for the undifferentiated state (ZBTB16/PLZF and CDH1) were expressed in nearly all spermatogonia from P1 through P7. In contrast, differentiation markers (STRA8 and KIT) appeared in a subset of spermatogonia at P4, coincident with the onset of RA signaling. GFRA1, which was present in nearly all prospermatogonia at P1, was only retained in STRA8/KIT- spermatogonia. From P4 through P10, there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the male germ cell population in terms of expression of markers, as markers characteristic of the undifferentiated (except GFRA1) and differentiating states were co-expressed through this interval. After P10, these fate markers diverged to mark distinct populations of undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia, and this pattern was maintained in juvenile (P18) and adult (P>60) testes. Taken together, these results reveal that the spermatogonia population is heterogeneous during the first wave of spermatogenesis, and indicate that neonatal spermatogonia may not serve as an ideal substitute for studying the function of adult spermatogonia.","['Niedenberger, Bryan A', 'Busada, Jonathan T', 'Geyer, Christopher B']","['Niedenberger BA', 'Busada JT', 'Geyer CB']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology Brody School of Medicine and East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27834, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology Brody School of Medicine and East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27834, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology Brody School of Medicine and East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27834, USA Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology Brody School of Medicine and East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27834, USA geyerc@ecu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cdh1 Proteins)', '0 (Fzr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Cdh1 Proteins/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Testis/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC4350003,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['149/4/329 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-14-0653 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2015 Apr;149(4):329-38. doi: 10.1530/REP-14-0653.,['(c) 2015 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.'],,,"['R15 HD072552/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD072552/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS653749'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these drugs have shown limited clinical efficacy as single agents in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other solid tumor malignancies, and rational combination strategies remain underexplored. To develop a novel therapeutic approach, we examined the efficacy of ABT-263 across >500 cancer cell lines, including 311 for which we had matched expression data for select genes. We found that high expression of the proapoptotic gene Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) predicts sensitivity to ABT-263. In particular, SCLC cell lines possessed greater BIM transcript levels than most other solid tumors and are among the most sensitive to ABT-263. However, a subset of relatively resistant SCLC cell lines has concomitant high expression of the antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1). Whereas ABT-263 released BIM from complexes with BCL-2 and BCL-XL, high expression of MCL-1 sequestered BIM released from BCL-2 and BCL-XL, thereby abrogating apoptosis. We found that SCLCs were sensitized to ABT-263 via TORC1/2 inhibition, which led to reduced MCL-1 protein levels, thereby facilitating BIM-mediated apoptosis. AZD8055 and ABT-263 together induced marked apoptosis in vitro, as well as tumor regressions in multiple SCLC xenograft models. In a Tp53; Rb1 deletion genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC, the combination of ABT-263 and AZD8055 significantly repressed tumor growth and induced tumor regressions compared with either drug alone. Furthermore, in a SCLC patient-derived xenograft model that was resistant to ABT-263 alone, the addition of AZD8055 induced potent tumor regression. Therefore, addition of a TORC1/2 inhibitor offers a therapeutic strategy to markedly improve ABT-263 activity in SCLC.","['Faber, Anthony C', 'Farago, Anna F', 'Costa, Carlotta', 'Dastur, Anahita', 'Gomez-Caraballo, Maria', 'Robbins, Rebecca', 'Wagner, Bethany L', 'Rideout, William M 3rd', 'Jakubik, Charles T', 'Ham, Jungoh', 'Edelman, Elena J', 'Ebi, Hiromichi', 'Yeo, Alan T', 'Hata, Aaron N', 'Song, Youngchul', 'Patel, Neha U', 'March, Ryan J', 'Tam, Ah Ting', 'Milano, Randy J', 'Boisvert, Jessica L', 'Hicks, Mark A', 'Elmiligy, Sarah', 'Malstrom, Scott E', 'Rivera, Miguel N', 'Harada, Hisashi', 'Windle, Brad E', 'Ramaswamy, Sridhar', 'Benes, Cyril H', 'Jacks, Tyler', 'Engelman, Jeffrey A']","['Faber AC', 'Farago AF', 'Costa C', 'Dastur A', 'Gomez-Caraballo M', 'Robbins R', 'Wagner BL', 'Rideout WM 3rd', 'Jakubik CT', 'Ham J', 'Edelman EJ', 'Ebi H', 'Yeo AT', 'Hata AN', 'Song Y', 'Patel NU', 'March RJ', 'Tam AT', 'Milano RJ', 'Boisvert JL', 'Hicks MA', 'Elmiligy S', 'Malstrom SE', 'Rivera MN', 'Harada H', 'Windle BE', 'Ramaswamy S', 'Benes CH', 'Jacks T', 'Engelman JA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA 02129; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; acfaber@vcu.edu jengelman@partners.org.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA 02129; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; David H.

However, it has not been useful for other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we explored the effect of SALL4, a stem cell factor, on ATRA-induced AML differentiation in both ATRA-sensitive and ATRA-resistant AML cells. Aberrant SALL4 expression has been found in nearly all human AML cases, whereas, in normal bone marrow and peripheral blood cells, its expression is only restricted to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We reason that, in AMLs, SALL4 activation may prevent cell differentiation and/or protect self-renewal that is seen in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Indeed, our studies show that ATRA-mediated myeloid differentiation can be largely blocked by exogenous expression of SALL4, whereas ATRA plus SALL4 knockdown causes significantly increased AML differentiation and cell death. Mechanistic studies indicate that SALL4 directly associates with retinoic acid receptor alpha and modulates ATRA target gene expression. SALL4 is shown to recruit lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) to target genes and alter the histone methylation status. Furthermore, coinhibition of LSD1 and SALL4 plus ATRA treatment exhibited the strongest anti-AML effect. These findings suggest that SALL4 plays an unfavorable role in ATRA-based regimes, highlighting an important aspect of leukemia therapy.","['Liu, Li', 'Liu, Liang', 'Leung, Lai-Han', 'Cooney, Austin J', 'Chen, Changyi', 'Rosengart, Todd K', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Yang, Jianchang']","['Liu L', 'Liu L', 'Leung LH', 'Cooney AJ', 'Chen C', 'Rosengart TK', 'Ma Y', 'Yang J']","['From the Departments of Surgery and.', 'the Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau 519020, China, and.', 'the Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau 519020, China, and.', 'the Michael E.

Thus, Phf6 is a ""lineage-specific"" cancer gene that plays opposing roles in developmentally distinct hematopoietic malignancies.","['Meacham, Corbin E', 'Lawton, Lee N', 'Soto-Feliciano, Yadira M', 'Pritchard, Justin R', 'Joughin, Brian A', 'Ehrenberger, Tobias', 'Fenouille, Nina', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Young, Richard A', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Meacham CE', 'Lawton LN', 'Soto-Feliciano YM', 'Pritchard JR', 'Joughin BA', 'Ehrenberger T', 'Fenouille N', 'Zuber J', 'Williams RT', 'Young RA', 'Hemann MT']","['The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA;', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA;', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA;', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA; hemann@mit.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins']",PMC4358400,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['29/5/483 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.254151.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2015 Mar 1;29(5):483-8. doi: 10.1101/gad.254151.114.,['(c) 2015 Meacham et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Phf6', 'context dependency', 'in vivo screen', 'leukemia']","['T32 GM007287/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA112967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA128803-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54-CA112967-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: Although clinical outcomes are favorable in patients wth Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML who receive first-line TKI therapy with imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, disease progression or relapse may occur. Thus, effective second-line agents are crucial. Bosutinib (Bosulif, Pfizer Inc.) is a second-generation TKI approved for the treatment of patients with Ph-positive chronic-, accelerated-, or blast-phase CML who are intolerant or resistant to other TKIs. Bosutinib inhibits a tyrosine kinase oncogene and Src kinases responsible for CML pathogenesis. Bosutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4; therefore, concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided. Bosutinib is effective in cases involving most imatinib-resistant mutations (not including the T315I and V299L mutations). Clinical trials demonstrated bosutinib's efficacy in inducing durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses, as well as high rates of progression-free and overall survival, in patients with CML who had developed resistance or intolerance to other TKIs. However, bosutinib was not found to be superior to imatinib for inducing cytogenetic responses in cases of newly diagnosed CML and is thus not indicated for use in TKI-naive patients. The most common adverse events among bosutinib-treated patients in clinical trials were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which were generally transient and self-limited. CONCLUSION: Bosutinib is a safe and effective second-line treatment option for select patients with Ph-positive CML who were intolerant or resistant to prior TKI therapy.","['Doan, Vi', 'Wang, Alice', 'Prescott, Hillary']","['Doan V', 'Wang A', 'Prescott H']","['Vi Doan, Pharm.D., is Postgraduate Year 2 Oncology Pharmacy Resident; Alice Wang, Pharm.D., BCOP, is Clinical Pharmacy Specialist; and Hillary Prescott, Pharm.D., BCOP, is Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. vpdoan@mdanderson.org.', 'Vi Doan, Pharm.D., is Postgraduate Year 2 Oncology Pharmacy Resident; Alice Wang, Pharm.D., BCOP, is Clinical Pharmacy Specialist; and Hillary Prescott, Pharm.D., BCOP, is Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Vi Doan, Pharm.D., is Postgraduate Year 2 Oncology Pharmacy Resident; Alice Wang, Pharm.D., BCOP, is Clinical Pharmacy Specialist; and Hillary Prescott, Pharm.D., BCOP, is Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitriles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['72/6/439 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp140221 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2015 Mar 15;72(6):439-47. doi: 10.2146/ajhp140221.,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

We analysed the cohort of 70 patients treated in the international, multicenter phase II PTLD-1 trial (NCT01458548) to identify such factors. Of the previously published scoring systems in PTLD, the international prognostic index (IPI), the PTLD prognostic index and the Ghobrial score were predictive for overall survival. None of the scoring systems had a considerable effect on the risk for disease progression. Age and ECOG performance status were the baseline variables with the highest prognostic impact in the different scoring systems. Baseline variables not included in the scoring systems that had an impact on overall survival and disease progression were the type of transplant and the response to rituximab at interim staging. Thoracic organ transplant recipients who did not respond to rituximab monotherapy were at particularly high risk for death from disease progression with subsequent CHOP-based chemotherapy. Patients in complete remission after four courses of rituximab and patients in partial remission with low-risk IPI had a low risk of disease progression.

Laparoscopic isolation of cortical ovarian tissue followed by cryopreservation with subsequent autotransplantation has temporarily restored fertility in at least 27 women who survived cancer, and aided in pubertal transition for one pediatric patient. However, reintroducing cancer cells through ovarian transplantation has been a major concern. Decellularization is a process of removing cellular material, while maintaining the organ skeleton of extracellular matrices (ECM). The ECM that remains could be stripped of cancer cells and reseeded with healthy ovarian cells. We tested whether a decellularized ovarian scaffold could be created, recellularized and transplanted to initiate puberty in mice.

Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) generates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, leading to the activation of proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Termination of phosphoinositide signaling requires hydrolysis of inositol ring phosphate groups through the actions of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase (PTEN), PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatases (eg, SHIP), and PtdIns(3,4)P2 4-phosphatases (eg, INPP4B). The biological relevance of most of these phosphoinositide phosphatases in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poorly understood. Mass spectrometry-based gene expression profiling of 3-, 4- and 5-phosphatases in human AML revealed significant overexpression of INPP4B. Analysis of an expanded panel of 205 AML cases at diagnosis revealed INPP4B overexpression in association with reduced responses to chemotherapy, early relapse, and poor overall survival, independent of other risk factors. Ectopic overexpression of INPP4B conferred leukemic resistance to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), daunorubicin, and etoposide. Expression of a phosphatase inert variant (INPP4B C842A) failed to abrogate resistance of AML cells to chemotherapy in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, targeted suppression of endogenously overexpressed INPP4B by RNA interference sensitized AML cell lines and primary AML to chemotherapy. These findings demonstrate a previously unsuspected and clinically relevant role for INPP4B gain of function as a mediator of chemoresistance and poor survival outcome in AML independent of its phosphoinositide phosphatase function.","['Rijal, Sewa', 'Fleming, Shaun', 'Cummings, Nik', 'Rynkiewicz, Natalie K', 'Ooms, Lisa M', 'Nguyen, Nhu-Y N', 'Teh, Tse-Chieh', 'Avery, Sharon', 'McManus, Julie F', 'Papenfuss, Anthony T', 'McLean, Catriona', 'Guthridge, Mark A', 'Mitchell, Christina A', 'Wei, Andrew H']","['Rijal S', 'Fleming S', 'Cummings N', 'Rynkiewicz NK', 'Ooms LM', 'Nguyen NY', 'Teh TC', 'Avery S', 'McManus JF', 'Papenfuss AT', 'McLean C', 'Guthridge MA', 'Mitchell CA', 'Wei AH']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia;', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Bioinformatics Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia;', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150303,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.66 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptome', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31743-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-603555 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 30;125(18):2815-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-603555.

Although their heterotrimeric receptors have two receptor subunits in common, these two cytokines have contrasting roles in adaptive immune responses. The unique role of IL2 through maintenance of fitness of regulatory T cells and activation-induced cell death is the elimination of self-reactive T cells to prevent autoimmunity. In contrast with IL2, IL15 is dedicated to the prolonged maintenance of memory T-cell responses to invading pathogens. Blockade of IL2 and IL15 using monoclonal antibodies has been reported to be of value in the treatment of patients with leukemia, autoimmune disorders, and in the prevention of allograft rejection. IL2 has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with malignant renal cell cancer and metastatic malignant melanoma. Clinical trials involving recombinant human IL15 given by bolus infusions have been completed, and studies assessing subcutaneous and continuous intravenous infusions are under way in patients with metastatic malignancy. Furthermore, clinical trials are being initiated that employ the combination of IL15 with IL15Ralpha(+/-) IgFc.","['Waldmann, Thomas A']",['Waldmann TA'],"['Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. tawald@helix.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-15/genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",PMC4351780,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['3/3/219 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2015 Mar;3(3):219-27. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0009.,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['ZIA SC004002-45/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS654637'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that AML patients with high levels of INPP4B (INPP4B(high)) had poor response to induction therapy, shorter event-free survival and shorter overall survival. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that INPP4B(high) was an independent predictor of poor prognosis, significantly improving current predictive models, where it outperformed conventional biomarkers including FLT3-ITD and NPM1. Furthermore, INPP4B(high) effectively segregated relative risk in AML patients with normal cytogenetics. The role of INPP4B on the biology of leukemic cells was assessed in vitro. Overexpression of INPP4B in AML cell lines enhanced colony formation potential, recapitulated the chemotherapy resistance observed in AML patients and promoted proliferation in a phosphatase-dependent, and Akt-independent manner. These findings reveal that INPP4B(high) has an unexpected role consistent with oncogenesis in AML, in contrast to its previously reported tumor-suppressive role in epithelial cancers. Overall, we propose that INPP4B is a novel prognostic biomarker in AML that has potential to be translated into clinical practice both as a disease marker and therapeutic target.","['Dzneladze, I', 'He, R', 'Woolley, J F', 'Son, M H', 'Sharobim, M H', 'Greenberg, S A', 'Gabra, M', 'Langlois, C', 'Rashid, A', 'Hakem, A', 'Ibrahimova, N', 'Arruda, A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Valk, P J M', 'Minden, M D', 'Salmena, L']","['Dzneladze I', 'He R', 'Woolley JF', 'Son MH', 'Sharobim MH', 'Greenberg SA', 'Gabra M', 'Langlois C', 'Rashid A', 'Hakem A', 'Ibrahimova N', 'Arruda A', 'Lowenberg B', 'Valk PJ', 'Minden MD', 'Salmena L']","['1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [3] Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [3] Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150304,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.66 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201551 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.51 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1485-95. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.51.

This study evaluated the long-term prognosis of liver-transplanted patients with BCS secondary to MPN and the effect of immunosuppression on MPN progression. METHODS: A total of 78 patients with BCS were evaluated between 1982 and 2013. Of those, 40 patients suffered from polycythaemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET). One patient had primary myelofibrosis (PMF). All patients received the standard immunosuppressive regimen. We retrospectively evaluated the long-term survival, clinical course and laboratory parameters of patients with MPN. RESULTS: Exactly 29/41 patients (71%) with MPN survived >/= 3 years [mean age 36 +/- 11 years; females n = 27 (93%)]. Mean follow-up after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was 12.4 +/- 7.3 years (range 3-28 years). Five- and 10-year survival rates were not significantly different in patients with and without MPN (P = 0.81 and P = 0.66 respectively) or in patients with PV and ET (P = 0.29 and P = 0.55 respectively). Thrombosis and bleeding developed in 7/29 (24%) long-term MPN survivors with no significant difference between ET and PV (P = 0.18). In the long-term follow-up, there was no evidence of progression to overt myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In the uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analyses, MPN did not influence survival after OLT. CONCLUSIONS: Budd-Chiari syndrome patients with and without underlying MPN had similar long-term survival rates after OLT. There was no evidence of enhanced progression of MPN after OLT secondary to immunosuppressive therapy. However, major haemorrhage and recurrent thrombosis contributed to morbidity and mortality after OLT in those patients.","['Potthoff, Andrej', 'Attia, Dina', 'Pischke, Sven', 'Mederacke, Ingmar', 'Beutel, Gernot', 'Rifai, Kinan', 'Deterding, Katja', 'Heiringhoff, Karlheinz', 'Klempnauer, Jurgen', 'Strassburg, Christian P', 'Manns, Michael P', 'Bahr, Matthias J']","['Potthoff A', 'Attia D', 'Pischke S', 'Mederacke I', 'Beutel G', 'Rifai K', 'Deterding K', 'Heiringhoff K', 'Klempnauer J', 'Strassburg CP', 'Manns MP', 'Bahr MJ']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endemic Medicine, Beni Suef University, Beni Suef, Egypt.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20150331,United States,Liver Int,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,101160857,,IM,"['Adult', 'Budd-Chiari Syndrome/*complications/mortality/surgery', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/mortality/surgery', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Liver Failure/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/methods/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/mortality/surgery', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/liv.12816 [doi]'],ppublish,Liver Int. 2015 Aug;35(8):2042-9. doi: 10.1111/liv.12816.

Since sympathetic nerve fibers may change phenotype from catecholaminergic to cholinergic (example: sweat glands), loss of nerve fibers may relate to undetectable TH. We aimed to investigate possible catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic transition of sympathetic nerve fibers in synovial tissue of animals with arthritis, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), and we wanted to find a possible transition factor. METHODS: Nerve fibers were detected by immunofluorescence towards TH (catecholaminergic) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (cholinergic). Co-culture experiments with sympathetic ganglia and lymphocytes or osteoclast progenitors were designed to find stimulators of catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic transition (including gene expression profiling). RESULTS: In mouse joints, an increased density of cholinergic relative to catecholaminergic nerve fibers appeared towards day 35 after immunization, but most nerve fibers were located in healthy joint-adjacent skin or muscle and almost none in inflamed synovial tissue. In humans, cholinergic fibers are more prevalent in OA synovial tissue than in RA. Co-culture of sympathetic ganglia with osteoclast progenitors obtained from healthy but not from arthritic animals induced catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic transition. Osteoclast mRNA microarray data indicated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a candidate transition factor, which was confirmed in ganglia experiments, particularly, in the presence of progesterone. CONCLUSION: In humans and mice, catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic sympathetic transition happens in less inflamed tissue but not in inflamed arthritic tissue. Under healthy conditions, presence of cholinergic sympathetic nerve fibers may support the cholinergic anti-inflammatory influence recently described.","['Stangl, Hubert', 'Springorum, Hans-Robert', 'Muschter, Dominique', 'Grassel, Susanne', 'Straub, Rainer H']","['Stangl H', 'Springorum HR', 'Muschter D', 'Grassel S', 'Straub RH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Rheumatology and Neuroendocrine Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Orthopedic Surgery, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Orthopedic Surgery, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Rheumatology and Neuroendocrine Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.

This case report discusses a 76-year-old man with a history of prefibrotic post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis on ruxolitinib, who developed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with peripheral blasts. Results of a bone marrow biopsy and PET and CT scans revealed stage IV leukemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Several days after cessation of ruxolitinib, the patient developed fevers, hypotension, and low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation, and subsequently developed spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, which resulted in death. This case is unique in several aspects: it highlights the rare possibility of lymphomatous transformation of myeloproliferative disorders, an unusual presentation of lymphoma masquerading as leukemia, and the possibility of ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome. Additionally, this case serves as a reminder that the use of novel therapies should be adopted after a thorough assessment of long-term risks, including those associated with abrupt withdrawal.","['Bhatt, Vijaya Raj', 'Bociek, R Gregory', 'Yuan, Ji', 'Fu, Kai', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Dave, Bhavana J', 'Rajan, Sandeep K', 'Armitage, James O']","['Bhatt VR', 'Bociek RG', 'Yuan J', 'Fu K', 'Greiner TC', 'Dave BJ', 'Rajan SK', 'Armitage JO']","['From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Pathology and Microbiology; and Human Genetics Laboratory, Munroe Meyer Institute for Genetics and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/diagnosis', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/diagnosis', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['13/3/281 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2015.0039 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2015 Mar;13(3):281-7. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2015.0039.,['Copyright (c) 2015 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found that USP9X is overexpressed in B-ALL cell lines and human patients. We investigated the role of USP9X in B-ALL and found that USP9X knockdown significantly reduced leukemic cell growth and increased spontaneous apoptosis, thereby improving survival in immunodeficient mice. These effects are partially mediated by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as we found that USP9X-knockdown leukemic cells displayed MCL1 down-regulation, with decreased BCL-2/BCL-XL levels and increased BAX levels. In addition, we demonstrated that USP9X inhibition negatively regulates mTORC1 activity toward its substrate S6K1. Clinically, USP9X inhibition sensitized glucocorticoid-resistant ALL cells to prednisolone; this observation reveals a potential avenue for improving the treatment of drug-resistant relapses. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of USP9X targeting and glucocorticoids treatment has attractive utility in B-ALL. This approach represents a potential strategy for promising combination therapies for lymphoid malignancies.","['Zhou, Mi', 'Wang, Ting', 'Lai, Huiling', 'Zhao, Xuejiao', 'Yu, Qin', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Yang, Yang']","['Zhou M', 'Wang T', 'Lai H', 'Zhao X', 'Yu Q', 'Zhou J', 'Yang Y']","['Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

These findings provide promising evidence that IGFBP signatures could be used as predictive tools in AML, with applications in remission surveillance and the development of IGFBP-directed biologic therapy.","['Karmali, Reem', 'Larson, Melissa L', 'Shammo, Jamile M', 'Basu, Sanjib', 'Christopherson, Kent', 'Borgia, Jeffrey A', 'Venugopal, Parameswaran']","['Karmali R', 'Larson ML', 'Shammo JM', 'Basu S', 'Christopherson K', 'Borgia JA', 'Venugopal P']","['a Section of Hematology Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'a Section of Hematology Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'a Section of Hematology Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'b Section of Preventative Medicine , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'a Section of Hematology Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'c Division of Pathology , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'd Division of Biochemistry, Rush University Cancer Center , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'a Section of Hematology Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy , Chicago , IL , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150514,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/*blood', '*Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/03/05 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1022767 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(11):3135-42. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1022767.

Supramolecules that conjugate and decontaminate toxic metals have potential for use in treatment of cadmium intoxication. In addition, metal-coordinating ability has been postulated to contribute to the cytotoxic effects of anti-tumor agents such as cisplatin or bleomycin. Thiacalixarenes, cyclic oligomers of p-alkylphenol bridged by sulfur atoms, are supramolecules known to have potent coordinating ability to metal ions. In this study, we show that cadmium-coordinated thiacalix[4]arene tetrasulfate (TC4ATS-Cd) exhibits an anti-proliferative effect against T-cell leukemia cells. Cadmium exhibited cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 36 to 129 muM against epithelia-derived cancer cell lines, while TC4ATS-Cd elicited no significant cytotoxicity (IC50 > 947 muM). However, a number of T-cell leukemia cell lines exhibited marked sensitivity to TC4ATS-Cd. In Jurkat cells, toxicity of TC4ATS-Cd occurred with an IC50 of 6.9 muM, which is comparable to that of 6.5 muM observed for cadmium alone. TC4ATS-Cd induced apoptotic cell death through activation of caspase-3 in Jurkat cells. In a xenograft model, TC4ATS-Cd (13 mg/kg) treatment significantly suppressed the tumor growth of Jurkat cells in mice. In addition, TC4ATS-Cd-treated mice exhibited significantly less cadmium accumulation in liver and kidney compared to equimolar cadmium-treated mice. These results suggest that cadmium-coordinated supramolecules may have therapeutic potential for treatment of T-cell leukemia.","['Zhou, Xiaoping', 'Koizumi, Yukio', 'Zhang, Muxin', 'Natsui, Miyuki', 'Koyota, Souichi', 'Yamada, Manabu', 'Kondo, Yoshihiko', 'Hamada, Fumio', 'Sugiyama, Toshihiro']","['Zhou X', 'Koizumi Y', 'Zhang M', 'Natsui M', 'Koyota S', 'Yamada M', 'Kondo Y', 'Hamada F', 'Sugiyama T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Venture Business Laboratory, Akita University, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Research Center for Engineering Science, Graduate School of Engineering and Resource Science, Akita University, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Life Science, Graduate School of Engineering and Resource Science, Akita University, Akita, Japan.', 'Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering and Resource Science, Akita University, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150406,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cadmium Compounds)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (thiacalix(4)arenetetrasulfonate)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cadmium/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Cadmium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4452166,2015/03/05 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12651 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 May;106(5):635-41. doi: 10.1111/cas.12651.

The objective of our study was to evaluate efficacy of decitabine after azacitidine failure in a relatively large patient cohort based on conflicting results with 0-28% response rates (RR) in this setting in small patient series. Thirty-six consecutive high risk MDS and CMML patients who received decitabine after azacitidine failure were retrospectively reviewed. Response was based on IWG 2006 criteria for MDS and CMML with WBC<13G/l and also included for proliferative CMML the evolution of WBC, splenomegaly (SMG) and extramedullary disease (EMD). Patients received a median number of 3 (range 1-27) cycles of decitabine and 12 patients received at least 6 cycles. Seven (19.4%) patients were responders including 3 marrow CR (mCR), 2 stable disease (SD) with HI-E, 1 SD with HI-N and HI-P and 1 SD with HI-N. In a CMML patient with SD, specific skin lesions resolved with decitabine. Responses were generally short lived (2-5 months) except 1 responder currently ongoing with +11 months follow up. Two non-responders had prolonged SD (without HI) of 21 and 27 months duration respectively. Median OS from onset of decitabine was 7.3 months, without significant difference between responders and non-responders. Treatment with decitabine after azacitidine failure yielded modest ORR (19.4%) with short response duration and poor OS. Thus, use of decitabine in such patients who failed or progressed after azacitidine cannot be recommended, underscoring the need for novel strategies in this setting.","['Harel, Stephanie', 'Cherait, Amina', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Willekens, Christophe', 'Park, Sophie', 'Rigal, Marthe', 'Brechignac, Sabine', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Gardin, Claude', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Braun, Thorsten']","['Harel S', 'Cherait A', 'Berthon C', 'Willekens C', 'Park S', 'Rigal M', 'Brechignac S', 'Thepot S', 'Quesnel B', 'Gardin C', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P', 'Braun T']","['Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematogy, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematogy, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematogy, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France; Department of Hematology Seniors, Saint Louis Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France; Department of Hematology Seniors, Saint Louis Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris 13, Bobigny, France.

In addition, C4d-positive renal arterioles are both a good marker of complement system activation and a useful diagnostic tool for TA-TMA. Because dysregulation of the complement system is associated with TA-TMA, the complement system might be a therapeutic target, such as eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor. Herein, we describe an eight-yr-old boy who developed TA-TMA accompanied by severe renal dysfunction. His renal specimen showed diffuse C4d deposition in the renal arterioles, which is consistent with TA-TMA.

For Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), the malignant counterpart of HSC, currently only a selective number of genes of the WNT pathway are analyzed by using either gene expression or DNA-methylation profiles for the identification of prognostic markers and potential candidate targets for drug therapy. It is known that mRNA expression is controlled by DNA-methylation and that specific patterns can infer the ability to differentiate biological differences, thus a combined analysis using all WNT annotated genes could provide more insight in the WNT signaling. APPROACH: We created a computational approach that integrates gene expression and DNA promoter methylation profiles. The approach represents the continuous gene expression and promoter methylation profiles with nine discrete mutually exclusive scenarios. The scenario representation allows for a refinement of patient groups by a more powerful statistical analysis, and the construction of a co-expression network. We focused on 268 WNT annotated signaling genes that are derived from the molecular signature database. RESULTS: Using the scenarios we identified seven prognostic markers for overall survival and event-free survival. Three genes are novel prognostic markers; two with favorable outcome (PSMD2, PPARD) and one with unfavorable outcome (XPNPEP). The remaining four genes (LEF1, SFRP2, RUNX1, and AXIN2) were previously identified but we could refine the patient groups. Three AML risk groups were further analyzed and the co-expression network showed that only the good risk group harbors frequent promoter hypermethylation and significantly correlated interactions with proteasome family members.

Using in-cell western analysis, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry analysis, and biochemical inhibitors, we evaluated several oxidative stress (OS) and cell death markers. It was found that dxr (5-100 mumol/l) induced apoptosis by OS mechanisms involving DNA fragmentation (8-48%), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim, 33-92%), and H2O2 production (15-42%) under normoxia. In addition, dxr (10 mumol/l) induced activation and/or nuclei translocation of NF-kappaB (6.6, 1.6-fold increase), p53 (4.3, 3.1 f), c-Jun (9.5, 5.0 f), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (1.9, 3.9 f), caspase-3 (3.7, 1.9 f), overexpression of Parkin (2.1, 1.2 f)/PINK-1 (2.1 f) proteins, and reduced DJ-1 levels by half compared with untreated cells under normoxia, according to immunofluorescence and in-cell western analysis, respectively. In contrast, dxr (10 mumol/l) could not induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells under hypoxia. Effectively, dxr significantly reduced DNA fragmentation (6%), expression levels of cell death (e.g. p53, c-Jun, caspase-3, AIF), and OS (e.g. Parkin) markers, whereas it increased DeltaPsim, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha, 3.1, 2.3 f), NF-kappaB (6.8, 2.0 f), and DJ-1 (1.3, 1.0 f) levels. This investigation suggests that dxr might efficiently eliminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by OS-induced apoptosis under normoxic conditions through a minimal completeness of cell death signaling (i.e. mitochondria-caspase-3/AIF-dependent pathways) and through a direct DNA damage process. However, hypoxic conditions may reduce the effectiveness of dxr toxicity.","['Mendivil-Perez, Miguel', 'Velez-Pardo, Carlos', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio, Marlene']","['Mendivil-Perez M', 'Velez-Pardo C', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio M']","['Neuroscience Research Group, Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antioquia (UdeA), Medellin, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (parkin protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (PARK7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Protein Deglycase DJ-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Deglycase DJ-1', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000223 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2015 Jul;26(6):583-98. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we propose a simple, highly selective, label-free single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sensing device by electrochemically monitoring the diffusion flux of ferricyanide probe across probe DNA/morpholino duplex functionalized nanochannels of porous anodic alumina. When perfectly matched or mismatched target DNA flows through the nanochannels modified with probe DNA/morpholino duplex, it competes for the probe DNA from morpholino, resulting in a change of the surface charges. Thus, the diffusion flux of negatively charged electroactive probe ferricyanide is modulated since it is sensitive to the surface charge due to the electrostatic interactions in electric double layer-merged nanochannels. Monitoring of the change in diffusion flux of probe enables us to detect not only a single base or two base mismatched sequence but also the specific location of the mismatched base. As is demonstrated, SNPs in the PML/RARalpha fusion gene, known as a biomarker of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), have been successfully detected.","['Gao, Hong-Li', 'Wang, Min', 'Wu, Zeng-Qiang', 'Wang, Chen', 'Wang, Kang', 'Xia, Xing-Hua']","['Gao HL', 'Wang M', 'Wu ZQ', 'Wang C', 'Wang K', 'Xia XH']","['daggerState Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'parallelFood and Bioengineering College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luo-yang, Henan 471023, China.', 'daggerState Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'daggerState Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'daggerState Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'daggerState Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'daggerState Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150311,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Morpholines)', '8B2ZCK305O (morpholine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA/*analysis/*genetics', 'Morpholines/*chemistry', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/10/10 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac504830e [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2015 Apr 7;87(7):3936-41. doi: 10.1021/ac504830e.

Despite intense research efforts, drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure in CLL, particularly in patients with dysfunctional TP53. The objective of our work was to identify potential approaches that might overcome CLL drug refractoriness by examining the pro-apoptotic potential of targeting the cell surface receptor CD47 with serum-stable agonist peptides. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In peripheral blood samples collected from 80 patients with CLL with positive and adverse prognostic features, we performed in vitro genetic and molecular analyses that demonstrate that the targeting of CD47 with peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1 efficiently kills the malignant CLL B cells, including those from high-risk individuals with a dysfunctional TP53 gene, while sparing the normal T and B lymphocytes from the CLL patients. Further studies reveal that the differential response of normal B lymphocytes, collected from 20 healthy donors, and leukemic B cells to CD47 peptide targeting results from the sustained activation in CLL B cells of phospholipase C gamma-1 (PLCgamma1), a protein that is significantly over-expressed in CLL. Once phosphorylated at tyrosine 783, PLCgamma1 enables a Ca2+-mediated, caspase-independent programmed cell death (PCD) pathway that is not down-modulated by the lymphocyte microenvironment. Accordingly, down-regulation of PLCgamma1 or pharmacological inhibition of PLCgamma1 phosphorylation abolishes CD47-mediated killing. Additionally, in a CLL-xenograft model developed in NOD/scid gamma mice, we demonstrate that the injection of CD47 agonist peptides reduces tumor burden without inducing anemia or toxicity in blood, liver, or kidney. The limitations of our study are mainly linked to the affinity of the peptides targeting CD47, which might be improved to reach the standard requirements in drug development, and the lack of a CLL animal model that fully mimics the human disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides substantial progress in (i) the development of serum-stable CD47 agonist peptides that are highly effective at inducing PCD in CLL, (ii) the understanding of the molecular events regulating a novel PCD pathway that overcomes CLL apoptotic avoidance, (iii) the identification of PLCgamma1 as an over-expressed protein in CLL B cells, and (iv) the description of a novel peptide-based strategy against CLL.","['Martinez-Torres, Ana-Carolina', 'Quiney, Claire', 'Attout, Tarik', 'Boullet, Heloise', 'Herbi, Linda', 'Vela, Laura', 'Barbier, Sandrine', 'Chateau, Danielle', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Moumne, Roba', 'Sarfati, Marika', 'Karoyan, Philippe', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Launay, Pierre', 'Susin, Santos A']","['Martinez-Torres AC', 'Quiney C', 'Attout T', 'Boullet H', 'Herbi L', 'Vela L', 'Barbier S', 'Chateau D', 'Chapiro E', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Davi F', 'Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Moumne R', 'Sarfati M', 'Karoyan P', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Launay P', 'Susin SA']","['Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, INSERM UMRS1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France;

METHODS: Data from the Routes to Diagnosis project on 749,645 patients (2006-2010) with any of 27 cancers that can occur in either sex were analysed. Crude proportions and crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for emergency presentation, and interactions between sex, age and deprivation with cancer were examined. RESULTS: The overall proportion of patients diagnosed through emergency presentation varied greatly by cancer. Compared with men, women were at greater risk for emergency presentation for bladder, brain, rectal, liver, stomach, colon and lung cancer (e.g., bladder cancer-specific odds ratio for women vs men, 1.50; 95% CI 1.39-1.60), whereas the opposite was true for oral/oropharyngeal cancer, lymphomas and melanoma (e.g., oropharyngeal cancer-specific odds ratio for women vs men, 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Similarly, younger patients were at higher risk for emergency presentation for acute leukaemia, colon, stomach and oesophageal cancer (e.g., colon cancer-specific odds ratio in 35-44- vs 65-74-year-olds, 2.01; 95% CI 1.76-2.30) and older patients for laryngeal, melanoma, thyroid, oral and Hodgkin's lymphoma (e.g., melanoma specific odds ratio in 35-44- vs 65-74-year-olds, 0.20; 95% CI 0.12-0.33). Inequalities in the risk of emergency presentation by deprivation group were greatest for oral/oropharyngeal, anal, laryngeal and small intestine cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with the same cancer, the risk for emergency presentation varies notably by sex, age and deprivation group. The findings suggest that, beyond tumour biology, diagnosis through an emergency route may be associated both with psychosocial processes, which can delay seeking of medical help, and with difficulties in suspecting the diagnosis of cancer after presentation.","['Abel, G A', 'Shelton, J', 'Johnson, S', 'Elliss-Brookes, L', 'Lyratzopoulos, G']","['Abel GA', 'Shelton J', 'Johnson S', 'Elliss-Brookes L', 'Lyratzopoulos G']","['Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health, Forvie Site, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0SR, UK.', '1] Care Quality Commission, Finsbury Tower, 103-105 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TG, UK [2] National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN), Public Health England, 5th Floor, Wellington House, 135-155 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8UG, UK.', 'National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN), Public Health England, 5th Floor, Wellington House, 135-155 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8UG, UK.', 'National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN), Public Health England, 5th Floor, Wellington House, 135-155 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8UG, UK.', '1] Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health, Forvie Site, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0SR, UK [2] National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN), Public Health England, 5th Floor, Wellington House, 135-155 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8UG, UK [3] Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London WC1E 6BT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150331,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Emergencies', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Rare Diseases/*diagnosis', '*Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",PMC4385986,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc201552 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2015.52 [doi]']",epublish,Br J Cancer. 2015 Mar 31;112 Suppl 1:S129-36. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2015.52.,,,,"['PDF-2011-04-047/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'A18180/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sodium salts of these bidentate amino acid ligands have been interacted with [M(bpy)(H2O)2](NO3)2 giving the corresponding some new complexes with formula [M(bpy)(R-gly)]NO3 (where M is Pt(II) or Pd(II), bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine and R-gly is butyl-, hexyl- and octyl-glycine). Due to less solubility of octyl derivatives, the biological activities of butyl and hexyl derivatives have been tested against chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562. The interaction of these complexes with highly polymerized calf thymus DNA has been extensively studied by means of electronic absorption, fluorescence and other measurements. The experimental results suggest that these complexes positive cooperatively bind to DNA presumably via groove binding. Molecular dynamic results show that the DNA structure is largely maintained its native structure in hexylglycine derivative-water mixtures and at lower temperatures. The simulation data indicates that the more destabilizing effect of butylglycine is induced by preferential accumulation of these molecules around the DNA and due to their more negative free energy of binding via groove binding.","['Eslami Moghadam, Mahboube', 'Saidifar, Maryam', 'Divsalar, Adeleh', 'Mansouri-Torshizi, Hassan', 'Saboury, Ali Akbar', 'Farhangian, Hossein', 'Ghadamgahi, Maryam']","['Eslami Moghadam M', 'Saidifar M', 'Divsalar A', 'Mansouri-Torshizi H', 'Saboury AA', 'Farhangian H', 'Ghadamgahi M']","['a Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran , Tehran , Iran.', 'b Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Department , Materials and Energy Research Center , Karaj , Iran.', 'c Department of Biological Sciences , Kharazmi (Tarbiat Moallem) University , Tehran , Iran.', 'd Department of Chemistry , University of Sistan & Baluchestan , Zahedan , Iran.', 'e Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran , Tehran , Iran.', 'a Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran , Tehran , Iran.', 'f School of Chemistry , Damghan University , Damghan , Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150420,England,J Biomol Struct Dyn,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,8404176,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', ""551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)"", '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"[""2,2'-Dipyridyl/chemistry"", 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/*chemistry', '*Ligands', 'Macromolecular Substances/*chemistry', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Palladium/chemistry', 'Platinum/chemistry', 'Water/chemistry']",,2015/03/04 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/07391102.2015.1015056 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomol Struct Dyn. 2016;34(1):206-22. doi: 10.1080/07391102.2015.1015056.

Detection of these abnormalities is important in the risk-classification of patients but requires laborious experimentation. Various studies showed that gene expression profiles (GEP), and the gene signatures derived from GEP, can be used for the prediction of subtypes in AML. Similarly, successful prediction was also achieved by exploiting DNA-methylation profiles (DMP). There are, however, no studies that compared classification accuracy and performance between GEP and DMP, neither are there studies that integrated both types of data to determine whether predictive power can be improved. APPROACH: Here, we used 344 well-characterized AML samples for which both gene expression and DNA-methylation profiles are available. We created three different classification strategies including early, late and no integration of these datasets and used them to predict AML subtypes using a logistic regression model with Lasso regularization. RESULTS: We illustrate that both gene expression and DNA-methylation profiles contain distinct patterns that contribute to discriminating AML subtypes and that an integration strategy can exploit these patterns to achieve synergy between both data types. We show that concatenation of features from both data sets, i.e. early integration, improves the predictive power compared to classifiers trained on GEP or DMP alone. A more sophisticated strategy, i.e. the late integration strategy, employs a two-layer classifier which outperforms the early integration strategy. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that prediction of known cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in AML can be further improved by integrating GEP and DMP profiles.","['Taskesen, Erdogan', 'Babaei, Sepideh', 'Reinders, Marcel M J', 'de Ridder, Jeroen']","['Taskesen E', 'Babaei S', 'Reinders MM', 'de Ridder J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4347619,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-16-S4-S5 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-16-S4-S5 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2015;16 Suppl 4:S5. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S4-S5.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of Danu on the growth, apoptosis, autophagy, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the molecular mechanisms in human breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The results demonstrated that Danu remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and autophagy, and suppressed EMT in both breast cancer cell lines. Danu arrested MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in G2/M phase, accompanied by the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cyclin B1 and upregulation of p21 Waf1/Cip1, p27 Kip1, and p53. Danu significantly decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xl) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), but increased the expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), and promoted the cleavage of caspases 3 and 9. Furthermore, Danu significantly increased the expression levels of the membrane-bound microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II) and beclin 1 in breast cancer cells, two markers for autophagy. Danu induced the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) and inhibited the activation of protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways in breast cancer cells. Treatment with wortmannin (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) markedly inhibited Danu-induced activation of p38 MAPK and conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II. Pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAPK suppressed Akt activation, resulting in LC3-II accumulation and enhanced autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Erk1/2 also remarkably increased the level of LC3-II in MCF7 cells. Moreover, Danu inhibited EMT in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with upregulated E-cadherin and zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) but downregulated N-cadherin, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (TCF8/ZEB1), snail, slug, vimentin, and beta-catenin. Notably, Danu showed lower cytotoxicity toward normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells. These findings indicate that Danu promotes cellular apoptosis and autophagy but inhibits EMT in human breast cancer cells via modulation of p38 MAPK/Erk1/2/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Danu may represent a promising anticancer agent for breast cancer treatment. More studies are warranted to fully delineate the underlying mechanisms, efficacy, and safety of Danu in breast cancer therapy.","['Li, Jin-Ping', 'Yang, Yin-Xue', 'Liu, Qi-Lun', 'Zhou, Zhi-Wei', 'Pan, Shu-Ting', 'He, Zhi-Xu', 'Zhang, Xueji', 'Yang, Tianxin', 'Pan, Si-Yuan', 'Duan, Wei', 'He, Shu-Ming', 'Chen, Xiao-Wu', 'Qiu, Jia-Xuan', 'Zhou, Shu-Feng']","['Li JP', 'Yang YX', 'Liu QL', 'Zhou ZW', 'Pan ST', 'He ZX', 'Zhang X', 'Yang T', 'Pan SY', 'Duan W', 'He SM', 'Chen XW', 'Qiu JX', 'Zhou SF']","[""Department of Surgical Oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, People's Republic of China ; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA."", ""Department of Colorectal Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA ; Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center and Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA ; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center and Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Center for Bioengineering and Sensing Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah and Salt Lake Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", 'School of Medicine, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Xiaolan People's Hospital affiliated to Southern Medical University, Zhongshan, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of General Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Shunde affiliated to Southern Medical University, Shunde, Foshan, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA ; Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center and Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150217,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'M3X659D0FY (danusertib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4338784,2015/03/04 06:00,2016/08/10 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S74412 [doi]', 'dddt-9-1027 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2015 Feb 17;9:1027-62. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S74412. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Danusertib', 'EMT', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'breast cancer', 'cell cycle']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which catalyzes hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids (FFA), is aberrantly expressed in CLL, we investigated whether LPL regulates the oxidative metabolic capacity of CLL cells. We found that unlike normal B cells, CLL cells metabolize FFAs. Because STAT3 is constitutively activated in CLL cells and because we identified putative STAT3 binding sites in the LPL promoter, we sought to determine whether STAT3 drives the aberrant expression of LPL. Transfection of luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by LPL promoter fragments into MM1 cells revealed that STAT3 activates the LPL promoter. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that STAT3 binds to the LPL promoter. Furthermore, transfection of CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA downregulated LPL transcripts and protein levels, confirming that STAT3 activates the LPL gene. Finally, transfection of CLL cells with LPL-siRNAs decreased the capacity of CLL cells to oxidize FFAs and reduced cell viability. IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggests that CLL cells adopt their metabolism to oxidize FFA. Activated STAT3 induces LPL, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides into FFA. Therefore, inhibition of STAT3 is likely to prevent the capacity of CLL cells to utilize FFA.","['Rozovski, Uri', 'Grgurevic, Srdana', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Harris, David M', 'Li, Ping', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Wu, Ji Yuan', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Wierda, William', 'Burger, Jan', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jain, Nitin', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Grgurevic S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Harris DM', 'Li P', 'Liu Z', 'Wu JY', 'Jain P', 'Wierda W', 'Burger J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jain N', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Keating MJ', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. zestrov@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (LPL protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC4433415,2015/03/04 06:00,2016/03/11 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-14-0412 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0412 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2015 May;13(5):944-53. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0412.

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been implicated in these responses, although its role has not been defined. Here, we show that PML isoform II (PML-II) is specifically required for efficient induction of IFN-beta transcription and of numerous ISGs, acting at the point of transcriptional complex assembly on target gene promoters. PML-II associated with specific transcription factors NF-kappaB and STAT1, as well as the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), to facilitate transcriptional complex formation. The absence of PML-II substantially reduced binding of these factors and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to IFN-beta or ISGs promoters and sharply reduced gene activation. The unique C-terminal domain of PML-II was essential for its activity, while the N-terminal RBCC motif common to all PML isoforms was dispensable. We propose a model in which PML-II contributes to the transcription of multiple genes via the association of its C-terminal domain with relevant transcription complexes, which promotes the stable assembly of these complexes at promoters/enhancers of target genes, and that in this way PML-II plays a significant role in the development of type I IFN responses.","['Chen, Yixiang', 'Wright, Jordan', 'Meng, Xueqiong', 'Leppard, Keith N']","['Chen Y', 'Wright J', 'Meng X', 'Leppard KN']","['School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom Keith.Leppard@warwick.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (IRF3 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/metabolism', 'Interferon-beta/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4405644,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01478-14 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01478-14 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2015 May;35(10):1660-72. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01478-14.

More clinically aggressive cases of DLBCLs have high level of circulating interleukin 10 (IL10) cytokine and evidence of activated intracellular STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling. We investigated the role of IL10 and its surface receptor in supporting the neoplastic phenotype of DLBCLs. We determined that IL10RA gene is amplified in 21% and IL10RB gene in 10% of primary DLBCLs. Gene expression of IL10, IL10RA and IL10RB was markedly elevated in DLBCLs. We hypothesized that DLBCLs depend for their proliferation and survival on IL10-STAT3 signaling and that blocking the IL10 receptor (IL10R) would induce cell death. We used anti-IL10R blocking antibody, which resulted in a dose-dependent cell death in all tested activated B-cell-like subtype of DLBCL cell lines and primary DLBCLs. Response of germinal center B-cell-like subtype of DLBCL cell lines to anti-IL10R antibody varied from sensitive to resistant. Cells underwent cell cycle arrest, followed by induction of apoptosis. Cell death depended on inhibition of STAT3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT1 signaling. Anti-IL10R treatment resulted in interruption of IL10-IL10R autostimulatory loop. We thus propose that IL10R is a novel therapeutic target in DLBCLs.","['Beguelin, W', 'Sawh, S', 'Chambwe, N', 'Chan, F C', 'Jiang, Y', 'Choo, J-W', 'Scott, D W', 'Chalmers, A', 'Geng, H', 'Tsikitas, L', 'Tam, W', 'Bhagat, G', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Shaknovich, R']","['Beguelin W', 'Sawh S', 'Chambwe N', 'Chan FC', 'Jiang Y', 'Choo JW', 'Scott DW', 'Chalmers A', 'Geng H', 'Tsikitas L', 'Tam W', 'Bhagat G', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Shaknovich R']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', '1] The HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA [3] Tri-Instituitional Training Program in Computational Biology and Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1] Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada [2] Department of Pathology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', '1] Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150303,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-10)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201557 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.57 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1684-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.57.

Pevonedistat was administered via a 60-min intravenous infusion on days 1, 3 and 5 (schedule A, n = 27), or days 1, 4, 8 and 11 (schedule B, n = 26) every 21-days. Dose escalation proceeded using a standard '3 + 3' design. Responses were assessed according to published guidelines. The MTD for schedules A and B were 59 and 83 mg/m(2) , respectively. On schedule A, hepatotoxicity was dose limiting. Multi-organ failure (MOF) was dose limiting on schedule B. The overall complete (CR) and partial (PR) response rate in patients treated at or below the MTD was 17% (4/23, 2 CRs, 2 PRs) for schedule A and 10% (2/19, 2 PRs) for schedule B. Pevonedistat plasma concentrations peaked after infusion followed by elimination in a biphasic pattern. Pharmacodynamic studies of biological correlates of NAE inhibition demonstrated target-specific activity of pevonedistat.

Using only the hot spots studied, we identified clonal hemopoiesis in 0.8% of individuals under 60, rising to 19.5% of those >/=90 years, thus predicting that clonal hemopoiesis is much more prevalent than previously realized. DNMT3A-R882 mutations were most common and, although their prevalence increased with age, were found in individuals as young as 25 years. By contrast, mutations affecting spliceosome genes SF3B1 and SRSF2, closely associated with the myelodysplastic syndromes, were identified only in those aged >70 years, with several individuals harboring more than one such mutation.

The polycistronic miR-17-92 cluster, which encodes miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b, and miR-92a, was previously shown to be overexpressed in multiple types of cancer. In this study, target gene prediction algorithms were used to predict potential targets of the miR-17-92 cluster. WEE1, a kinase that inhibits cell cycle progression, was identified as a possible target of five of the six miRNAs in the cluster. Luciferase reporter assays were used to determine that miR-17, miR-20a, and miR-18a specifically target nucleotides 465-487 of the 3' UTR of WEE1, whereas miR-19a and miR-19b exert control on WEE1 by targeting nucleotides 1069-1091.

However, no comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle mitochondrial functions in long-term survivors has been performed and the presence of persistent chemotherapy-induced skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction remains a strong possibility. Non-tumour-bearing mice were treated with two drugs that have been used frequently in ALL treatment (doxorubicin and dexamethasone) for up to 4 cycles at 3-week intervals and euthanized 3 months after the 4th cycle. Treated animals had impaired growth and lower muscle mass as well as reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased reactive oxygen species production per unit oxygen consumption. Mitochondrial DNA content and protein levels of key mitochondrial membrane proteins and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis were unchanged, but protein levels of Parkin were reduced. This suggests a novel pattern of chemotherapy-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle that persists because of an acquired defect in mitophagy signaling. The results could explain the observed functional impairments in adult survivors of childhood ALL and may also be relevant to long-term survivors of other cancers treated with similar regimes.","['Gouspillou, Gilles', 'Scheede-Bergdahl, Celena', 'Spendiff, Sally', 'Vuda, Madhusudanarao', 'Meehan, Brian', 'Mlynarski, Heather', 'Archer-Lahlou, Elodie', 'Sgarioto, Nicolas', 'Purves-Smith, Fennigje M', 'Konokhova, Yana', 'Rak, Janusz', 'Chevalier, Stephanie', 'Taivassalo, Tanja', 'Hepple, Russell T', 'Jagoe, R Thomas']","['Gouspillou G', 'Scheede-Bergdahl C', 'Spendiff S', 'Vuda M', 'Meehan B', 'Mlynarski H', 'Archer-Lahlou E', 'Sgarioto N', 'Purves-Smith FM', 'Konokhova Y', 'Rak J', 'Chevalier S', 'Taivassalo T', 'Hepple RT', 'Jagoe RT']","['1] McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Departement de Kinanthropologie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '1] Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Department of Kinesiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '1] McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Department of Kinesiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""1] Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '1] McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Department of Kinesiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '1] McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Department of Kinesiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""1] Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Kinesiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '1] McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Department of Kinesiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '1] Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada [2] Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150303,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria, Muscle/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitophagy/drug effects', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",PMC4346812,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08717 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08717 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Mar 3;5:8717. doi: 10.1038/srep08717.,,,,"['111119/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', '119583/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Therapy consisted of three established blocks of re-induction chemotherapy. Epratuzumab (360 mg/m(2)/dose) was combined with chemotherapy on weekly x 4 (B1) and twice weekly x 4 [eight doses] (B2) schedules during the first re-induction block. Remission rates and minimal residual disease (MRD) status were compared to historical rates observed with the identical chemotherapy platform alone. RESULTS: CR2 was achieved in 65 and 66%, of the evaluable B1 (n = 54) and B2 patients (n = 60), respectively; unchanged from that observed historically without epratuzumab. Rates of MRD negativity (<0.01%) were 31% in B1 (P = 0.4128) and 39% in B2 patients (P = 0.1731), compared to 25% in historical controls. The addition of epratuzumab was well tolerated, with a similar toxicity profile to that observed with the re-induction chemotherapy platform regimen alone. CONCLUSIONS: Epratuzumab was well tolerated in combination with re-induction chemotherapy. While CR2 rates were not improved compared to historical controls treated with chemotherapy alone, there was a non-significant trend towards improvement in MRD response with the addition of epratuzumab (twice weekly for eight doses) to re-induction chemotherapy.","['Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Reid, Joel M', 'Goldenberg, David M', 'Wegener, William A', 'Zeng, Hui', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L']","['Raetz EA', 'Cairo MS', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Lu X', 'Devidas M', 'Reid JM', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Wegener WA', 'Zeng H', 'Whitlock JA', 'Adamson PC', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL']","['Department of Pediatrics and Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine, Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine, Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey.', 'Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine, Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150302,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3062P60MH9 (epratuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",PMC4701208,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25454 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jul;62(7):1171-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25454.

Over an 18-month period, we performed multicolor flow cytometry immunophenotyping (MFC) for AML minimal residual disease on >4,000 BM samples, and identified 41 patients who had >/=5% myeloblasts by morphology but negative by MFC. At the time of a negative MFC study, an abnormal cytogenetic study converted to negative in 14 patients and remained positive at a low level (2.5-9.5%) by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 3 (14%), of the latter, abnormalities subsequently disappeared in the repeated BM in 2 patients. Positive pretreatment mutations, including FLT3, NPM1, IDH1, CEBPA, became negative in all 10 patients tested. Of the seven patients with favorable cytogenetics, PML/RARA, CBFB-MYH11 or RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts were detected at various levels in six patients but all patients remained in complete remission. With no additional chemotherapy given, 39 patients had BM repeated (median 2 weeks, range <1-21), and all cases showed <5% BM blasts and a continuously negative MFC. In the end of follow-up (median 10 months, range 1-22), 13 patients experienced relapse, 12/13 showing clonal cytogenetic evolution/switch and 11 demonstrating major immunophenotypic shifts. We conclude that MFC is useful in identifying a regenerating BM sample with >/=5% BM blasts that would otherwise be scored as positive using standard morphologic examination. We believe this conclusion is supported by the changes in molecular cytogenetic status and the patient clinical follow-up data.","['Ouyang, Juan', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Peng, Jie', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Daver, Naval', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Lin, Pei', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Ouyang J', 'Goswami M', 'Tang G', 'Peng J', 'Ravandi F', 'Daver N', 'Routbort M', 'Konoplev S', 'Lin P', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiangya Medical School Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150402,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin']",PMC5594737,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23988 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jun;90(6):504-10. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23988.

It is often associated with adverse karyotypic abnormalities and overexpression of proteins that mediate drug resistance. We performed a phase III trial to determine whether induction therapy with cytarabine and amonafide L-malate, a DNA intercalator and non-ATP-dependent topoisomerase II inhibitor that evades drug resistance mechanisms, yielded a superior complete remission rate than standard therapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin in sAML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated sAML were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to cytarabine 200 mg/m(2) continuous intravenous (IV) infusion once per day on days 1 to 7 plus either amonafide 600 mg/m(2) IV over 4 hours on days 1 to 5 (A + C arm) or daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2) IV over 30 minutes once per day on days 1 to 3 (D + C arm). RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate was 46% (99 of 216 patients) in A + C arm and 45% (97 of 217 patients) in D + C arm (P = .81). The 30- and 60-day mortality rates were 19% and 28% in A + C arm and 13% and 21% in D + C arm, respectively. CONCLUSION: Induction treatment with A + C did not improve the CR rate compared with D + C in patients with sAML.","['Stone, Richard M', 'Mazzola, Emanuele', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Stuart, Robert K', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Damon, Lloyd', 'Jang, Jun-Ho', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Egyed, Miklos', 'Horst, Heinz-August', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Solomon, Scott R', 'Venugopal, Parameswaran', 'Lundberg, Ante S', 'Powell, Bayard']","['Stone RM', 'Mazzola E', 'Neuberg D', 'Allen SL', 'Pigneux A', 'Stuart RK', 'Wetzler M', 'Rizzieri D', 'Erba HP', 'Damon L', 'Jang JH', 'Tallman MS', 'Warzocha K', 'Masszi T', 'Sekeres MA', 'Egyed M', 'Horst HA', 'Selleslag D', 'Solomon SR', 'Venugopal P', 'Lundberg AS', 'Powell B']","['Richard M.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30504 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study that enrolled patients before chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) or carboplatin area under the curve of 5 on day 1 plus etoposide 100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 3 every 21 days for four to six cycles). Patients without progression were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or sunitinib 37.5 mg per day until progression. Cross-over after progression was allowed. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) from random assignment for maintenance placebo versus sunitinib using a one-sided log-rank test with alpha = .15; 80 randomly assigned patients provided 89% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients were enrolled; 138 patients received chemotherapy. Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned; 10 patients did not receive maintenance therapy (five on each arm). Eighty-five patients received maintenance therapy (placebo, n = 41; sunitinib, n = 44). Grade 3 adverse events with more than 5% incidence were fatigue (19%), decreased neutrophils (14%), decreased leukocytes (7%), and decreased platelets (7%) for sunitinib and fatigue (10%) for placebo; grade 4 adverse events were GI hemorrhage (n = 1) and pancreatitis, hypocalcemia, and elevated lipase (n = 1; all in same patient) for sunitinib and thrombocytopenia (n = 1) and hypernatremia (n = 1) for placebo. Median PFS on maintenance was 2.1 months for placebo and 3.7 months for sunitinib (HR, 1.62; 70% CI, 1.27 to 2.08; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.60; one-sided P = .02). Median overall survival from random assignment was 6.9 months for placebo and 9.0 months for sunitinib (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.10; one-sided P = .16). Three sunitinib and no placebo patients achieved complete response during maintenance. Ten (77%) of 13 patients evaluable after cross-over had stable disease on sunitinib (6 to 27 weeks). CONCLUSION: Maintenance sunitinib was safe and improved PFS in extensive-stage SCLC.","['Ready, Neal E', 'Pang, Herbert H', 'Gu, Lin', 'Otterson, Gregory A', 'Thomas, Sachdev P', 'Miller, Antonius A', 'Baggstrom, Maria', 'Masters, Gregory A', 'Graziano, Stephen L', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Bogart, Jeffrey', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Ready NE', 'Pang HH', 'Gu L', 'Otterson GA', 'Thomas SP', 'Miller AA', 'Baggstrom M', 'Masters GA', 'Graziano SL', 'Crawford J', 'Bogart J', 'Vokes EE']","['Neal E.

These results suggest a correlation between response (peripheral count recovery) and MRD at the time of morphologic remission. Here we examine this hypothesis and whether MRD and response provide independent prognostic information after accounting for other relevant covariates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 245 adults with AML who achieved CR, CRp, or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) after induction therapy. Bone marrow samples were collected on or closest to the first date of blood count recovery, and MRD was determined by 10-color multiparameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: The 71.0% of patients who achieved CR had MRD less frequently and had lower levels of MRD than the 19.6% of patients achieving CRp and 9.4% achieving CRi. Although pretreatment covariates such as cytogenetics, monosomal karyotype, relapsed or refractory rather than newly diagnosed AML, and FLT3 internal tandem duplication were associated with relapse, their prognostic effect was much lower once MRD and response were taken into account, the univariable statistical effect of which was not materially affected by inclusion of pretreatment covariates. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that post-therapy parameters including MRD status and response are important independent prognostic factors for outcome in patients with AML achieving remission. MRD status and type of response (CR v CRp or CRi) should play important, and perhaps dominant, roles in planning postinduction therapy.","['Chen, Xueyan', 'Xie, Hu', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Pagel, John M', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Sandhu, Vicky K', 'Abkowitz, Janis L', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Chen X', 'Xie H', 'Wood BL', 'Walter RB', 'Pagel JM', 'Becker PS', 'Sandhu VK', 'Abkowitz JL', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey EH']","['Xueyan Chen, Brent L.

The sample included 7,399 ALL cases and 11,181 controls aged 2-14 years. The data were collected by questionnaires administered to the parents. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, study, maternal education, and maternal age. Day-care center attendance in the first year of life was associated with a reduced risk of ALL (odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval: 0.71, 0.84), with a marked inverse trend with earlier age at start (P < 0.0001). An inverse association was also observed with breastfeeding duration of 6 months or more (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.94). No significant relationship with a history of common infections in infancy was observed even though the odds ratio was less than 1 for more than 3 infections. The findings of this large pooled analysis reinforce the hypothesis that day-care center attendance in infancy and prolonged breastfeeding are associated with a decreased risk of ALL.","['Rudant, Jeremie', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Petridou, Eleni', 'Dockerty, John D', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Ashton, Lesley J', 'Dessypris, Nikolaos', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Miller, Margaret', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Roman, Eve', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Rudant J', 'Lightfoot T', 'Urayama KY', 'Petridou E', 'Dockerty JD', 'Magnani C', 'Milne E', 'Spector LG', 'Ashton LJ', 'Dessypris N', 'Kang AY', 'Miller M', 'Rondelli R', 'Simpson J', 'Stiakaki E', 'Orsi L', 'Roman E', 'Metayer C', 'Infante-Rivard C', 'Clavel J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150301,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Birth Order', 'Breast Feeding/statistics & numerical data', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Day Care Centers/statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infections/epidemiology/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*immunology']",PMC4850899,2015/03/04 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/03/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['kwu298 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwu298 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2015 Apr 15;181(8):549-62. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwu298.

Here, we developed a modified version of the CoCoMo-qPCR assay, the ""BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2"" assay, which uses optimized degenerate primers. We also constructed a new plasmid standard.

The truncated, alternatively spliced, class IV G-CSFR (G-CSFRIV) has been associated with defective differentiation and relapse risk in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, the detailed biological properties of G-CSFRIV in human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and the potential leukemogenic mechanism of this receptor remain poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that G-CSFRIV-overexpressing (G-CSFRIV(+)) HSPCs demonstrated an enhanced proliferative and survival capacity on G-CSF stimulation. Cell cycle analyses showed a higher frequency of G-CSFRIV(+) cells in the S and G2/M phase. Also, apoptosis rates were significantly lower in G-CSFRIV(+) HSPCs. These findings were shown to be associated with a sustained Stat5 activation and elevated miR-155 expression. In addition, G-CSF showed to further induce G-CSFRIV and miR-155 expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from AML patients. A Stat5 pharmacological inhibitor or ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference-mediated silencing of the expression of miR-155 abrogated the aberrant proliferative capacity of the G-CSFRIV(+) HSPCs. Hence, the dysregulation of Stat5/miR-155 pathway in the G-CSFRIV(+) HSPCs supports their leukemogenic potential. Specific miRNA silencing or the inhibition of Stat5-associated pathways might contribute to preventing the risk of leukemogenesis in G-CSFRIV(+) HSPCs. This study may promote the development of a personalized effective antileukemia therapy, in particular for the patients exhibiting higher expression levels of G-CSFRIV, and further highlights the necessity of pre-screening the patients for G-CSFR isoforms expression patterns before G-CSF administration.","['Zhang, HaiJiao', 'Goudeva, Lilia', 'Immenschuh, Stephan', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Skokowa, Julia', 'Eiz-Vesper, Britta', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Figueiredo, Constanca']","['Zhang H', 'Goudeva L', 'Immenschuh S', 'Schambach A', 'Skokowa J', 'Eiz-Vesper B', 'Blasczyk R', 'Figueiredo C']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Excellence Cluster ""From Regenerative Biology to Reconstructive Therapies,"" REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology, University Hospital of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Excellence Cluster ""From Regenerative Biology to Reconstructive Therapies,"" REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Excellence Cluster ""From Regenerative Biology to Reconstructive Therapies,"" REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150409,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",PMC4398671,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2014.00146 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2014.00146 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2015 Apr 9;20:736-46. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2014.00146.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to compare the clinical presentation and prognosis of patients with HIV-related and HIV-unrelated DLBCL treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in the cART era. METHODS AND DESIGN: Eighty-one HIV-infected patients included in a Spanish multicentre trial were compared with 84 HIV-uninfected patients diagnosed in a Spanish institution in the same period all treated with R-CHOP. RESULTS: HIV-infected patients had a worse performance status, more frequent B-symptoms, and higher Ann-Arbor stages than HIV-uninfected patients, with similar frequency of extranodal involvement. The complete response (CR) rate of patients with high tumor burden was not different in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Patients with HIV-related DLBCL showed a worse overall survival (OS) (5-year OS: 56 vs. 74%) but a similar disease-free survival (DFS) (5-year DFS: 84 vs. 73%). In the subgroup of patients with high tumor, the results regarding survival were similar to the whole series. Previous AIDS-defining illness was the strongest negative prognostic factor for OS in HIV-infected patients. CONCLUSION: In the cART era, HIV-related DLBCL still presents more aggressive features than HIV-unrelated DLBCL, and has a worse OS despite having a similar DFS. Prevention of HIV-related complications is essential to achieve outcomes comparable with HIV-uninfected patients with DLBCL.","['Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Miralles, Pilar', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Moreno, Miriam', 'Sancho, Juan-Manuel', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Navarro, Jose-Tomas']","['Baptista MJ', 'Garcia O', 'Morgades M', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Miralles P', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Abella E', 'Moreno M', 'Sancho JM', 'Feliu E', 'Ribera JM', 'Navarro JT']","[""aHematology Department, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona bHematology Department, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat cInfectious Diseases Department, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid dHematology Department, Hospital Clinic eHematology Department, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active/methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Rituximab', 'Spain', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QAD.0000000000000624 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2015 Apr 24;29(7):811-8. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000000624.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore cell survival versus cell death decisions in this organ, we deleted the pro-survival gene Mcl-1 in the mammary epithelium. Mcl-1 was found to be essential at multiple developmental stages including morphogenesis in puberty and alveologenesis in pregnancy. Moreover, Mcl-1-deficient basal cells were virtually devoid of repopulating activity, suggesting that this gene is required for stem cell function. Profound upregulation of the Mcl-1 protein was evident in alveolar cells at the switch to lactation, and Mcl-1 deficiency impaired lactation. Interestingly, EGF was identified as one of the most highly upregulated genes on lactogenesis and inhibition of EGF or mTOR signalling markedly impaired lactation, with concomitant decreases in Mcl-1 and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. These data demonstrate that Mcl-1 is essential for mammopoiesis and identify EGF as a critical trigger of Mcl-1 translation to ensure survival of milk-producing alveolar cells.","['Fu, Nai Yang',

In this study, the oxidation of lipids, proteins and DNA was studied after the addition of hydrogen peroxide and Fenton reagent to cell suspension containing human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell line U937. EPR spin-trapping data showed that the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the cell suspension formed hydroxyl radical via Fenton reaction mediated by endogenous metals. The malondialdehyde HPLC analysis showed no lipid peroxidation after the addition of hydrogen peroxide, whereas the Fenton reagent caused significant lipid peroxidation. The formation of protein carbonyls monitored by dot blot immunoassay and the DNA fragmentation measured by comet assay occurred after the addition of both hydrogen peroxide and Fenton reagent. Oxidative damage of biomolecules leads to the formation of singlet oxygen as conformed by EPR spin-trapping spectroscopy and the green fluorescence of singlet oxygen sensor green detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. It is proposed here that singlet oxygen is formed by the decomposition of high-energy intermediates such as dioxetane or tetroxide formed by oxidative damage of biomolecules.","['Rac, Marek', 'Krupka, Michal', 'Binder, Svatopluk', 'Sedlarova, Michaela', 'Matuskova, Zuzana', 'Raska, Milan', 'Pospisil, Pavel']","['Rac M', 'Krupka M', 'Binder S', 'Sedlarova M', 'Matuskova Z', 'Raska M', 'Pospisil P']","['Department of Biophysics, Centre of the Region Hana for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Slechtitelu 11, 783 71, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 3, 775 15, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 3, 775 15, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Slechtitelu 11, 783 71, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 3, 775 15, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 3, 775 15, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biophysics, Centre of the Region Hana for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Slechtitelu 11, 783 71, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"[""0 (Fenton's reagent)"", '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Comet Assay', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Hydroxyl Radical/*toxicity', 'Iron/toxicity', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/analysis', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Protein Carbonylation/drug effects', 'Singlet Oxygen/*metabolism']",PMC4346403,2015/03/03 06:00,2016/01/28 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116958 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32014 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 2;10(3):e0116958. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116958. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 190 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were consecutively enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: low-ferritin group (<1000 ng/mL) and high-ferritin group (1000 ng/mL). The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of infection within 100 days after HSCT, which was similar between the two groups: bloodstream infection, 35 vs 38%, P=0.65; bacterial infection, 44 vs 41%, P=0.68; and fungal infection, 6 vs 8%, P=0.71. The 1-year adjusted probability of OS of the high-ferritin group was significantly lower than that of the low-ferritin group (76 vs 63%, P=0.017). Using receiver operating characteristic curve, the threshold of pretransplant serum ferritin levels for bloodstream infection was 1400 ng/mL; the threshold for OS, EFS and non-relapse mortality was 1349 ng/mL. In conclusion, pretransplant serum ferritin levels of 1000 ng/mL did not influence the incidence of infection but adversely affected OS after HSCT. A higher threshold of pretransplant serum ferritin levels may predict HSCT outcomes.","['Tanaka, M', 'Kanamori, H', 'Matsumoto, K', 'Tachibana, T', 'Numata, A', 'Ohashi, K', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Nakaseko, C', 'Kanda, Y', 'Yamazaki, E', 'Fujisawa, S', 'Ooi, J', 'Sakura, T', 'Aotsuka, N', 'Onoda, M', 'Machida, S', 'Kato, J', 'Usuki, K', 'Watanabe, R', 'Taguchi, J', 'Yano, S', 'Saito, T', 'Takahashi, S', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Okamoto, S']","['Tanaka M', 'Kanamori H', 'Matsumoto K', 'Tachibana T', 'Numata A', 'Ohashi K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Nakaseko C', 'Kanda Y', 'Yamazaki E', 'Fujisawa S', 'Ooi J', 'Sakura T', 'Aotsuka N', 'Onoda M', 'Machida S', 'Kato J', 'Usuki K', 'Watanabe R', 'Taguchi J', 'Yano S', 'Saito T', 'Takahashi S', 'Sakamaki H', 'Okamoto S']","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan [2] Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan [2] Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Disease Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Disease Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical Cell Biology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Narita Red Cross Hospital, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shizuoka Red Cross Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20150302,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Bacterial Infections/blood/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mycoses/blood/mortality', '*Preoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201517 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 May;50(5):727-33. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2015.17.

Reduced-intensity regimens allow a potent GVL response to occur with minimized treatment-related toxicity in patients of older age or with comorbidities that preclude the use of myeloablative conditioning. Whether RIC SCT is appropriate for younger and more standard risk patients is not well defined and the field is changing rapidly; a prospective randomized trial of myeloablative vs RIC (BMT-CTN 0901) was recently closed when early results indicated better outcomes for myeloablative regimens. However, detailed results are not available, and all patients in that study were eligible for myeloablative conditioning. RIC transplants will likely remain the standard of care as many patients with AML are not eligible for myeloablative conditioning. Recent publication of mature results from retrospective and prospective cohorts provide contemporary efficacy and toxicity data for these attenuated regimens. In addition, recent studies explore the use of alternative donors, introduce regimens that attempt to reduce toxicity without reducing intensity, and identify predictive factors that pave the way to personalized approaches. These studies paint a picture of the future of RIC transplants.

The detection limit of the BCR-ABL transcript, particularly after treatment, is controversial. In the present study, we used quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to monitor BCR-ABL expression in Moroccan CML patients undergoing imatinib treatment, and compared the results with those of conventional PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The aim of this study was to establish a new molecular tool for in vitro diagnosis of CML. In a retrospective comparative analysis, 20 CML Moroccan patients who had received imatinib treatment (N = 20) were analyzed by real-time PCR, conventional RT-PCR, and FISH. Half of the samples analyzed (N = 10) were positive for BCR-ABL gene expression, while the other half (N = 10) were negative according to conventional PCR.

A total of 167 primary AML cases and 328 healthy control subjects were recruited at the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province between March 2009 and January 2012. The polymorphisms rs1800896, rs1800871, and rs1800872 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariate regression analyses showed that subjects carrying the rs1800871 CC genotype and C allele had a significantly increased risk of AML, with adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.72 (1.01-2.97) and 1.38 (1.04-1.81), respectively. Those carrying the rs1800872 G allele had a slightly increased risk of AML, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.30 (1.01-1.72). Moreover, genotyping results demonstrated that subjects carrying both the rs1800871 C allele and rs1800872 G allele had a moderately increased risk of AML, indicating that the 2 genotypes had a synergistic effect on AML risk (odds ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval = 1.24- 3.15). Our results demonstrated that polymorphisms in rs1800871 and rs1800872 enhance the risk of AML, and these 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms have a synergistic effect on AML risk.","['Fei, C', 'Yao, X M', 'Sun, Y', 'Gu, X Z', 'Yu, L Q', 'Lai, X']","['Fei C', 'Yao XM', 'Sun Y', 'Gu XZ', 'Yu LQ', 'Lai X']","[""Nephrology Department, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Haematology Department, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Molecular Biology Laboratory, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Haematology Department, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Haematology Department, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Haematology Department, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China laisheen1984@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Asians', 'China', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr4182 [pii]', '10.4238/2015.February.2.15 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2015 Feb 2;14(1):925-30. doi: 10.4238/2015.February.2.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Afterwards, it was established that genetic abnormalities can affect the stem and progenitor cells, leading to uncontrolled replication and deregulated differentiation. These alterations will cause the changeover to cancerous stem cells (CSC) having two main characteristics: tumor initiation and maintenance. This review will focus on the colorectal cancer stem cell (CR-CSCs) theory which provides a better understanding of different tumor processes: initiation, aggressive growth, recurrence, treatment resistance and metastasis. A search in PubMed/Medline was performed using the following keywords: colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs), colorectal neoplasms stem cells, colorectal cancer stem cell (CR-CSCs) markers, etc. Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists, abstracts and proceedings from meetings. Isolation of CR-CSCs can be achieved by targeting and selecting subpopulation of tumor cells based on expression of one or multiple cell surface markers associated with cancer self-renewal, markers as: CD133, CD166, CD44, CD24, beta1 integrin-CD29, Lgr5, EpCAM (ESA), ALDH-1, Msi-1, DCAMLK1 or EphB receptors. The identification and localization of CR-CSCs through different markers will hopefully lead to a better stratification of prognosis and treatment response, as well as the development of new effective strategies for cancer management.","['Cherciu, Irina', 'Barbalan, A', 'Pirici, D', 'Margaritescu, C', 'Saftoiu, A']","['Cherciu I', 'Barbalan A', 'Pirici D', 'Margaritescu C', 'Saftoiu A']","['Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.', 'Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.', 'Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.', 'Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.', 'Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140804,Romania,Curr Health Sci J,Current health sciences journal,101597164,,,,PMC4340434,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/03/03 06:01,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12865/CHSJ.40.03.01 [doi]', '2014.3.01 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Health Sci J. 2014 Jul-Sep;40(3):153-61. doi: 10.12865/CHSJ.40.03.01.

It can occur in a balanced or unbalanced form and as a sole abnormality is associated with an intermediate prognosis. Additionally, this translocation is observed in the context of hyperdiploid B-ALL, in which case it is associated with a poor prognosis. However, due to different translocation partner genes at chromosomes 1 and 19, distinct subtypes of hyperdiploid B-ALL with t(1;19)/der(19)t(1;19) are recognized based on the presence or absence of the TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, but the cytogenetic and etiologic differences between the two remain understudied. FINDINGS: We report a case of an adult with a history of relapsed precursor B-ALL whose conventional cytogenetics showed an abnormal female karyotype with both hyperdiploidy and a t(1;19)(q23;p13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on previously G-banded metaphases using the LSI TCF3/PBX1 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe confirmed the presence of the TCF3-PBX1 gene fusion. CONCLUSIONS: This particular pattern with a TCF3-PBX1 fusion within the context of a hyperdiploid karyotype is seen in B-ALL and is usually associated with a poor outcome. This case is one of only a few cases with both hyperdiploidy and a confirmed TCF3-PBX1 fusion, demonstrating the importance of using FISH for proper molecular classification of these cases in order to distinguish them from those with hyperdiploidy but no TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene. Such molecular studies may provide insight into the precise differences between TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative hyperdiploid B-ALL bearing the t(1;19)(q23;p13).","['Tirado, Carlos A', 'Shabsovich, David', 'Yeh, Lei', 'Pullarkat, Sheeja T', 'Yang, Lynn', 'Kallen, Michael', 'Rao, Nagesh']","['Tirado CA', 'Shabsovich D', 'Yeh L', 'Pullarkat ST', 'Yang L', 'Kallen M', 'Rao N']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150218,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC4344763,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/03/03 06:01,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-015-0029-0 [doi]', '29 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2015 Feb 18;3:4. doi: 10.1186/s40364-015-0029-0. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'FISH', 'TCF3-PBX1', 'cytogenetics', 'hyperdiploidy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary aim of our study was to improve risk stratification of ALL patients into treatment groups using DNA methylation as a complement to current diagnostic methods. A secondary aim was to gain insight into the functional role of DNA methylation in ALL. RESULTS: We used the methylation status of ~450,000 CpG sites in 546 well-characterized patients with T-ALL or seven recurrent B-cell precursor ALL subtypes to design and validate sensitive and accurate DNA methylation classifiers. After repeated cross-validation, a final classifier was derived that consisted of only 246 CpG sites. The mean sensitivity and specificity of the classifier across the known subtypes was 0.90 and 0.99, respectively. We then used DNA methylation classification to screen for subtype membership of 210 patients with undefined karyotype (normal or no result) or non-recurrent cytogenetic aberrations ('other' subtype). Nearly half (n = 106) of the patients lacking cytogenetic subgrouping displayed highly similar methylation profiles as the patients in the known recurrent groups. We verified the subtype of 20% of the newly classified patients by examination of diagnostic karyotypes, array-based copy number analysis, and detection of fusion genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Using RNA-seq data from ALL patients where cytogenetic subtype and DNA methylation classification did not agree, we discovered several novel fusion genes involving ETV6, RUNX1, and PAX5. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that DNA methylation profiling contributes to the clarification of the heterogeneity in cytogenetically undefined ALL patient groups and could be implemented as a complementary method for diagnosis of ALL. The results of our study provide clues to the origin and development of leukemic transformation. The methylation status of the CpG sites constituting the classifiers also highlight relevant biological characteristics in otherwise unclassified ALL patients.","['Nordlund, Jessica', 'Backlin, Christofer L', 'Zachariadis, Vasilios', 'Cavelier, Lucia', 'Dahlberg, Johan', 'Ofverholm, Ingegerd', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Nordgren, Ann', 'Overnas, Elin', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Flaegstad, Trond', 'Heyman, Mats M', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Gustafsson, Mats G', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Nordlund J', 'Backlin CL', 'Zachariadis V', 'Cavelier L', 'Dahlberg J', 'Ofverholm I', 'Barbany G', 'Nordgren A', 'Overnas E', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Flaegstad T', 'Heyman MM', 'Jonsson OG', 'Kanerva J', 'Larsson R', 'Palle J', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Gustafsson MG', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Forestier E', 'Syvanen AC']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 1432, BMC, SE-751 44 Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Cancer Pharmacology and Computational Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Entrance 40, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Rudbecklaboratoriet, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 1432, BMC, SE-751 44 Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 1432, BMC, SE-751 44 Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Rondvagen 10, SE-416 85 Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tromso University and University Hospital, Sykehusveien 38, N-9038 Tromso, Norway.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Q6:05, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Barnaspitali Hringsins, Landspitali University Hospital, Norethurmyri, 101, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Box 281, FIN-00029 Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Medical Sciences, Cancer Pharmacology and Computational Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Entrance 40, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 1432, BMC, SE-751 44 Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Oncology, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Entrance 95, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, and the Medical Faculty, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Cancer Pharmacology and Computational Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Entrance 40, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Oncology, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Entrance 95, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Medical Biosciences, University of Umea, SE-901 85 Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 1432, BMC, SE-751 44 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150217,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,,PMC4343276,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/03/03 06:01,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-014-0039-z [doi]', '39 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2015 Feb 17;7:11. doi: 10.1186/s13148-014-0039-z. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['450 k array', 'CpG site', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA methylation', 'Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'RNA-seq', 'Subtyping', 'epigenetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of action underlying the anti-tumour activity of CAM are multiple and include prolonged reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, autophagy inhibition, and anti-angiogenesis.

Overall these findings justify further research with CAM in many tumour types, with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and lung cancer having the highest level of evidence. Finally, a series of proposals are being made to further investigate the use of CAM in clinical trials which offer the greatest prospect of clinical benefit to patients.","['Van Nuffel, An Mt', 'Sukhatme, Vidula', 'Pantziarka, Pan', 'Meheus, Lydie', 'Sukhatme, Vikas P', 'Bouche, Gauthier']","['Van Nuffel AM', 'Sukhatme V', 'Pantziarka P', 'Meheus L', 'Sukhatme VP', 'Bouche G']","['Anticancer Fund, Brussels, 1853 Strombeek-Bever, Belgium.', 'GlobalCures, Inc, Newton, MA 02459, USA.', 'Anticancer Fund, Brussels, 1853 Strombeek-Bever, Belgium ; The George Pantziarka TP53 Trust, London KT1 2JP, UK.', 'Anticancer Fund, Brussels, 1853 Strombeek-Bever, Belgium.', 'GlobalCures, Inc, Newton, MA 02459, USA ; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Anticancer Fund, Brussels, 1853 Strombeek-Bever, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150224,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,,,,PMC4341996,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/03/03 06:01,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2015.513 [doi]', 'can-9-513 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2015 Feb 24;9:513. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2015.513. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ReDO project', 'anti-bacterial agents', 'antineoplastic agents', 'clarithromycin', 'drug repositioning', 'neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the expression of FST was partially silenced at both transcriptional and translational levels by RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ-ZsGreen Vector mediated recombinant pshRNA vectors in bovine granulosa cells (bGCs). The results showed that transfection with FST-1 and FST-2 vectors significantly down-regulated mRNA and protein expressions of follistatin by 51% (P = 0.0093) and 72% (P = 0.0078) respectively. After down-regulation of FST in bGCs, cell cycle was arrested at S-phase (9.2 +/- 0.6 vs 12.5 +/- 0.2, P = 0.0055), and apoptosis was significantly (21.3 +/- 2.7 vs 13.9 +/- 2.5, P = 0.0051) increased. These findings were further verified by down-regulation of protein level of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2, P = 0.0423), and up-regulation of caspase-3 (P = 0.0362), p21 (P = 0.0067) and mRNA levels of Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax, P = 0.041). Knockdown of FST in bGCs significantly increased activin A concentration in culture medium, while level of estradiol (E2) was suppressed without affecting progesterone production. In addition, mRNA levels of all activin receptor subtypes [activin receptor types I (ACRI) and II (ACRIIA and ACRIIB)] and inhibin alpha-subunit were augmented (P < 0.05) without altering both inhibin beta-subunits. These findings suggest that follistatin may participate in caspase3-dependent apoptosis through Bcl2/Bax gene family in bovine GCs, whereas, activin and its receptors are associated with its regulation. Activin-induced up-regulation of inhibin-alpha subunit in bGCs seems to be involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis.","['Chong, Zhenlu', 'Dong, Ping', 'Riaz, Hasan', 'Shi, Lei', 'Yu, Xue', 'Cheng, Ying', 'Yang, Liguo']","['Chong Z', 'Dong P', 'Riaz H', 'Shi L', 'Yu X', 'Cheng Y', 'Yang L']","[""Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Education Ministry of China, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Education Ministry of China, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Bio sciences, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Sahiwal 57000, Pakistan.', ""Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Education Ministry of China, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Education Ministry of China, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Education Ministry of China, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Education Ministry of China, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, People's Republic of China.

Dopamine by itself is a potent activator of resting effector T cells (Teffs), via two independent ways: direct Teffs activation, and indirect Teffs activation by suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The review covers the following findings: (i) T cells express functional dopamine receptors (DRs) D1R-D5R, but their level and function are dynamic and context-sensitive, (ii) DR membranal protein levels do not necessarily correlate with DR mRNA levels, (iii) different T cell types/subtypes have different DR levels and composition and different responses to dopamine, (iv) autoimmune and pro-inflammatory T cells and T cell leukaemia/lymphoma also express functional DRs, (v) dopamine (~10(-8) M) activates resting/naive Teffs (CD8(+) >>>CD4(+) ), (vi) dopamine affects Th1/Th2/Th17 differentiation, (vii) dopamine inhibits already activated Teffs (i.e. T cells that have been already activated by either antigen, mitogen, anti-CD3 antibodies cytokines or other molecules), (viii) dopamine inhibits activated Tregs in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Thus, dopamine 'suppresses the suppressors' and releases the inhibition they exert on Teffs, (ix) dopamine affects intracellular signalling molecules and cascades in T cells (e.g. ERK, Lck, Fyn, NF-kappaB, KLF2), (x) T cells produce dopamine (Tregs>>>Teffs), can release dopamine, mainly after activation (by antigen, mitogen, anti-CD3 antibodies, PKC activators or other), uptake extracellular dopamine, and most probably need dopamine, (xi) dopamine is important for antigen-specific interactions between T cells and dendritic cells, (xii) in few autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis/SLE/rheumatoid arthritis), and neurological/psychiatric diseases (e.g. Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia and Tourette), patient's T cells seem to have abnormal DRs expression and/or responses to dopamine or production of dopamine, (xiii) drugs that affect the dopaminergic system have potent effects on T cells (e.g. dopamine=Intropin, L-dopa, bromocriptine, haloperidol, quinpirole, reserpine, pergolide, ecopipam, pimozide, amantadine, tetrabenazine, nomifensine, butaclamol). Dopamine-induced activation of resting Teffs and suppression of Tregs seem beneficial for health and may also be used for immunotherapy of cancer and infectious diseases. Independently, suppression of DRs in autoimmune and pro-inflammatory T cells, and also in cancerous T cells, may be advantageous.

We studied the impact of preventive intravenous (IV) antibiotic administration at onset of absolute neutropenia on the incidence and outcome of life-threatening infections during treatment of childhood AML. PROCEDURES: This is a retrospective study on pediatric patients (aged 0-18 years) consecutively diagnosed with de novo AML and treated at a single institution from April 2005 through February 2013. Patients were treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML0531 protocol or with a modified United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK MRC) AML 10 regimen. Pertinent data were extracted from hard copy or electronic chart review. RESULTS: A total of 76 chemotherapy phases were analyzed from 29 patients. In each phase reported, preventive antibiotics were initiated when the daily absolute neutrophil count was <500 cells/mcl, before onset of fever. Seven episodes of bacteremia were documented with predominantly coagulase-negative staphylococci and viridans group streptococci. One infection-related death occurred, attributed to progressive respiratory failure occurring months after documented candidal pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of preventive antibiotics at the onset of absolute neutropenia was associated with no mortality from bacteremia. This preventive approach appears feasible and safe.","['Nolt, Dawn', 'Lindemulder, Susan', 'Meyrowitz, Jeffrey', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Malempati, Suman', 'Thomas, Gregory', 'Stork, Linda']","['Nolt D', 'Lindemulder S', 'Meyrowitz J', 'Chang BH', 'Malempati S', 'Thomas G', 'Stork L']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150301,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/microbiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25463 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jul;62(7):1149-54. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25463.

There are three isoforms of PIP4Ks: PIP4K2A, 2B and 2C, which localise to different subcellular compartments with the PIP4K2B isoform being localised predominantly in the nucleus. Suppression of PIP4K expression selectively prevents tumour cell growth in vitro and prevents tumour development in mice that have lost the tumour suppressor p53. p53 is lost or mutated in over 70% of all human tumours. These studies suggest that inhibition of PIP4K signalling constitutes a novel anti-cancer therapeutic target.

The proven and probable IFI incidence was 30/125 (24%). Profound neutropenia was detected in 18 (60%) patients, and prolonged neutropenia was detected in 16 (53.3%) of the patients. The most isolated agents were non-albicans Candida spp. The crude and attributable mortality was 20% and 13.3% respectively. Profound neutropenia was associated with mortality (P < 0.05). The younger patients were especially at risk for proven IFI. Prolonged neutropenia, to be in the induction phase of chemotherapy, and profound neutropenia were found to be the most common predisposing factors for IFI episodes.","['Sahbudak Bal, Zumrut', 'Yilmaz Karapinar, Deniz', 'Karadas, Nihal', 'Sen, Semra', 'Onder Sivis, Zuhal', 'Akinci, Ayse B', 'Balkan, Can', 'Kavakli, Kaan', 'Vardar, Fadil', 'Aydinok, Yesim']","['Sahbudak Bal Z', 'Yilmaz Karapinar D', 'Karadas N', 'Sen S', 'Onder Sivis Z', 'Akinci AB', 'Balkan C', 'Kavakli K', 'Vardar F', 'Aydinok Y']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150227,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Neutropenia/*complications/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/myc.12303 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2015 Apr;58(4):225-32. doi: 10.1111/myc.12303.

PROCEDURE: Properties of CD22 expression relevant to therapeutic targeting were characterized in primary samples obtained from children and young adults with relapsed and chemotherapy refractory B-precursor (pre-B) ALL. RESULTS: CD22 expression was demonstrated in all subjects (n = 163) with detection on at least 90% of blasts in 155 cases. Median antigen site density of surface CD22 was 3,470 sites/cell (range 349-19,653, n = 160). Blasts from patients with known 11q23 (MLL) rearrangement had lower site density (median 1,590 sites/cell, range 349-3,624, n = 20 versus 3,853 sites/cell, range 451-19,653, n = 140; P = <0.0001) and 6 of 21 cases had sub-populations of blasts lacking CD22 expression (22%-82% CD22 +). CD22 expression was maintained in serial studies of 73 subjects, including those treated with anti-CD22 targeted therapy. The levels of soluble CD22 in blood and marrow by ELISA were low and not expected to influence the pharmacokinetics of anti-CD22 directed agents. CONCLUSIONS: These characteristics make CD22 an excellent potential therapeutic target in patients with relapsed and chemotherapy-refractory ALL, although cases with MLL rearrangement require close study to exclude the presence of a CD22-negative blast population.","['Shah, Nirali N', 'Stevenson, Maryalice Stetler', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Richards, Kelly', 'Delbrook, Cindy', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Shah NN', 'Stevenson MS', 'Yuan CM', 'Richards K', 'Delbrook C', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I', 'Wayne AS']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150301,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC4405453,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25410 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):964-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25410.

Although treatment outcome has considerably improved with chemo-immunotherapy, most patients eventually relapse and CLL is still incurable. Thus, newer and more rationally developed drugs are needed to improve CLL therapy, particularly in cases of relapsed/refractory disease. AREAS COVERED: The authors review preclinical and clinical data regarding newer CLL agents, currently undergoing examination, such as: signal transduction and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors, next generation mAbs, heat shock protein 90 and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Newer compounds with different mechanisms of action, such as B-cell receptor signal transduction inhibitors, lenalidomide, next generation mAbs and several pro-apoptotic molecules, have shown efficacy in relapsed or refractory CLL patients. Several studies are under way to investigate the efficacy of combinations of these novel drugs. Hopefully, the combined use of these molecules in risk-adapted treatment strategies will change the therapeutic approach in the near future and will pave the way for a long-term control of CLL.","['Morabito, Fortunato', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'De Stefano, Laura', 'Bossio, Sabrina', 'Morabito, Lucio', 'Pellicano, Mariavaleria', 'Palummo, Angela', 'Storino, Francesca', 'Caruso, Nadia', 'Gentile, Massimo']","['Morabito F', 'Recchia AG', 'Vigna E', 'De Stefano L', 'Bossio S', 'Morabito L', 'Pellicano M', 'Palummo A', 'Storino F', 'Caruso N', 'Gentile M']","['Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza, Dipartimento Oncoematologico, Unita Operativa Complessa di Ematologia , Viale della Repubblica, Cosenza 87100 , Italy +39 0984 681329 ; +39 0984 681866 ; fortunato_morabito@tin.it ; massim.gentile@tiscali.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150301,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2015.1021920 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2015 Jun;24(6):795-807. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2015.1021920.

The poster child for this alternative approach to the treatment of cancer is imatinib, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor designed to target chronic myeloid leukaemia driven by the BCR-ABL translocation in a defined patient population. The improvement in survival achieved by treatment of this patient cohort with imatinib is impressive. Thus, the aim is to provide efficacy but with low toxicity. The role of the medicinal chemist in oncology drug discovery is now closely aligned with the role in most other therapeutic areas with high-throughput and/or fragment-based screening, structure-based design, selectivity, pharmacokinetic optimisation and pharmacodynamic biomarker modulation, all playing a familiar part in the process. In this chapter, we selected four areas in which compounds are either approved drugs or in clinical trials. These are chaperone inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. Even within these areas, we have been selective, particularly for kinase inhibitors, and our aim has been to exemplify newer approaches and novel aspects of medicinal chemistry.","['Chessum, Nicola', 'Jones, Keith', 'Pasqua, Elisa', 'Tucker, Michael']","['Chessum N', 'Jones K', 'Pasqua E', 'Tucker M']","['Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150123,Netherlands,Prog Med Chem,Progress in medicinal chemistry,0376452,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0079-6468(14)00005-8 [pii]', '10.1016/bs.pmch.2014.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Med Chem. 2015;54:1-63. doi: 10.1016/bs.pmch.2014.11.002.

ChIP-Seq furnishes millions of short reads that, after alignment, describe the genome-wide binding sites of a particular TF. However, in all organisms investigated an average of 40% of reads fail to align to the corresponding genome, with some datasets having as much as 80% of reads failing to align. We describe here the provenance of previously unaligned reads in ChIP-Seq experiments from animals and plants. We show that a substantial portion corresponds to sequences of bacterial and metazoan origin, irrespective of the ChIP-Seq chromatin source. Unforeseen was the finding that 30%-40% of unaligned reads were actually alignable. To validate these observations, we investigated the characteristics of the previously unaligned reads corresponding to TAL1, a human TF involved in lineage specification of hemopoietic cells. We show that, while unmapped ChIP-Seq read datasets contain foreign DNA sequences, additional TFBSs can be identified from the previously unaligned ChIP-Seq reads. Our results indicate that the re-evaluation of previously unaligned reads from ChIP-Seq experiments will significantly contribute to TF target identification and determination of emerging properties of GRNs.","['Ouma, Wilberforce Zachary', 'Mejia-Guerra, Maria Katherine', 'Yilmaz, Alper', 'Pareja-Tobes, Pablo', 'Li, Wei', 'Doseff, Andrea I', 'Grotewold, Erich']","['Ouma WZ', 'Mejia-Guerra MK', 'Yilmaz A', 'Pareja-Tobes P', 'Li W', 'Doseff AI', 'Grotewold E']","['1] Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '1] Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Oh no sequences!

Here we show that interactions between A/E and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) are sufficient to prime leukemia cells for subsequent aggressive growth. In agreement with this, HIF1alpha is highly expressed in A/E-positive AML patients and strongly predicts inferior outcomes, regardless of gene mutations. Co-expression of A/E and HIF1alpha in leukemia cells causes a higher cell proliferation rate in vitro and more serious leukemic status in mice. Mechanistically, A/E and HIF1alpha form a positive regulatory circuit and cooperate to transactivate DNMT3a gene leading to DNA hypermethylation. Pharmacological or genetic interventions in the A/E-HIF1alpha loop results in DNA hypomethylation, a re-expression of hypermethylated tumor-suppressor p15(INK4b) and the blockage of leukemia growth. Thus high HIF1alpha expression serves as a reliable marker, which identifies patients with a poor prognosis in an otherwise prognostically favorable AML group and represents an innovative therapeutic target in high-risk A/E-driven leukemia.","['Gao, X N', 'Yan, F', 'Lin, J', 'Gao, L', 'Lu, X L', 'Wei, S C', 'Shen, N', 'Pang, J X', 'Ning, Q Y', 'Komeno, Y', 'Deng, A L', 'Xu, Y H', 'Shi, J L', 'Li, Y H', 'Zhang, D E', 'Nervi, C', 'Liu, S J', 'Yu, L']","['Gao XN', 'Yan F', 'Lin J', 'Gao L', 'Lu XL', 'Wei SC', 'Shen N', 'Pang JX', 'Ning QY', 'Komeno Y', 'Deng AL', 'Xu YH', 'Shi JL', 'Li YH', 'Zhang DE', 'Nervi C', 'Liu SJ', 'Yu L']","['1] Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China [2] The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Division of Biological Sciences, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Division of Biological Sciences, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', ""Department of Medical Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, University of Rome 'La Sapienza', Latina, Italy."", 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201556 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.56 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1730-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.56.

Pre-B ALL is one of the most common ALLs, comprising about 80% of childhood cases. A variety of genes are involved in metabolizing carcinogens. These gene polymorphisms can result in less efficient or overly-down metabolic pathways, which may contribute to the susceptibility to develop cancer. Glutathione S-transferase omega (GSTO) is a new known class among GSTs superfamily. GSTO1 and GSTO2 polymorphisms have been reported to be related to several types of disease. We assessed the association between GSTO1 and GSTO2 polymorphisms and childhood pre-B ALL risk in Iran. METHODS: This case-control study analyzed GSTO1 A140D (rs. 4925) and GSTO2 N142D (rs. 156697) gene polymorphisms using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, in 100 patients and 120 healthy controls. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies were not significantly different between patients and healthy controls. Odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for mutant homozygotes were 1.54 (0.628-3.778) and 0.791 (0.349-1.793) for GSTO1 A140D and GSTO2 N142D, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study found no significant association between Pre-B ALL and GSTO1 A140D and GSTO2 N142D polymorphisms.","['Rezazadeh, D', 'Moradi, M-T', 'Kazemi, A', 'Mansouri, K']","['Rezazadeh D', 'Moradi MT', 'Kazemi A', 'Mansouri K']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Medical Technologies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center and Student Research Committee, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology, School of Para Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Medical Technologies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150227,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTO2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology']",,2015/03/03 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/03/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12332 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Aug;37(4):530-5. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12332.

While LIF induces the differentiation of several myeloid leukemia cells and inhibits their growth, it also promotes tumor progression, metastasis and chemoresistance in many solid tumors. LIF is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis of patients. Currently, the mechanism for LIF overexpression in tumor cells is not well-understood. Here, we report that hypoxia, a hallmark of solid tumors, induced LIF mRNA expression in human colorectal cancer cells. Analysis of LIF promoter revealed several hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) that can specifically interact with and be transactivated by HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha. Consistently, ectopic expression of HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha transcriptionally induced LIF expression levels in cells. Knockdown of endogenous HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha by siRNA largely abolished the induction of LIF by hypoxia in cells. Furthermore, there is a strong association of HIF-2alpha overexpression with LIF overexpression in human colorectal cancer specimens. In summary, results from this study demonstrate that hypoxia induces LIF expression in human cancer cells mainly through HIF-2alpha, which could be an important underlying mechanism for LIF overexpression in human cancers.","['Wu, Lihua', 'Yu, Haiyang', 'Zhao, Yuhan', 'Zhang, Cen', 'Wang, Jiabei', 'Yue, Xuetian', 'Yang, Qifeng', 'Hu, Wenwei']","['Wu L', 'Yu H', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang C', 'Wang J', 'Yue X', 'Yang Q', 'Hu W']","['Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis']",PMC4414199,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3017 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3017 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):4406-17. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3017.,,,,"['R01 CA160558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA160558-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PU.1-induced monocytic differentiation into macrophage is also important for blood cancer development. Therefore, we chose THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells to investigate the function of a recently discovered IL-32theta. Genetic analyses identified differences in the sequences of IL-32theta and IL-32beta. Using previously established cell lines that stably express IL-32theta and IL-32beta and cell lines transiently expressing IL-32theta, we observed that expression of IL-32theta inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced monocytic differentiation in both THP-1 and HL-60 cells. IL-32theta also suppressed expression of the macrophage cell surface markers, CD11b, CD18, and CD36. Interestingly, expression of IL-32beta or IL-32theta had no effect on the expression levels of cell cycle related factors. As a result, we concluded that these isoforms did not contribute to PMA-induced cell cycle arrest. IL-32theta was found to modulate expression of PU.1, a transcription factor necessary for myeloid lineage commitment. Transient expression of PU.1 in THP-1/IL-32theta cells rescued the observed differentiation defect. Additionally, transient expression of both CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and PU.1 in THP-1/IL-32theta cells exhibited synergistic effects in rescuing the differentiation defect. These observations indicate that intracellular IL-32theta inhibits the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages by attenuating PU.1 expression.","['Kim, Man Sub', 'Kang, Jeong-Woo', 'Park, Yun Sun', 'Lee, Dong Hun', 'Bak, Yesol', 'Kwon, Taeho', 'Yoon, Do-Young']","['Kim MS', 'Kang JW', 'Park YS', 'Lee DH', 'Bak Y', 'Kwon T', 'Yoon DY']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis', 'Transfection']",PMC4414198,2015/03/03 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/02 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3013 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3013 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):4394-405. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, Amphipterygium adstringens infusion is used for gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer. Extracts from this tree have microbicidal effects against Helicobacter pylori, an important risk factor for gastric cancer development. Anacardic acids are constituents of A. adstringens, and 6-pentadecyl salicylic acid (6-PSA) is the most abundant. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effects of 6-PSA on cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated whether 6-PSA has differential effects on the induction of genotoxicity, cytostaticity, and apoptosis in normal human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs), bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of Balb/c mice, and human transformed cell lines derived from both gastric cancer (AGS cells) and leukaemia (K562 cells). Treatment with 6-PSA (30-150 muM) reduced the viability of AGS and K562 cells together with a moderate, but significant, increase in the frequency of micronucleated cells and the induction of DNA breakage (Comet Assay). Moreover, 6-PSA increased the apoptosis rate in both the AGS and K562 cell lines in a caspase 8-dependent manner. In contrast, neither cytotoxicity nor genotoxicity were observed in PBMCs or bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of Balb/c mice after treatment with low doses of 6-PSA (0.2-2.0 mg/Kg). Instead, 6-PSA treatment resulted in the inhibition of PBMC proliferation, which was reversible after the compound was removed. Additionally, 6-PSA treatments (2-20 mg/Kg) increased the frequency of mature polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow, suggesting a possible effect on the differentiation process of immune cells. The present results indicate that 6-PSA induces cytotoxicity and moderate genotoxicity, together with an increase in the apoptosis rate, in a caspase 8-dependent manner in gastric cancer cells. In contrast, a low toxicity was observed when PBMCs were exposed to 6-PSA.","['Alam-Escamilla, David', 'Estrada-Muniz, Elizabet', 'Solis-Villegas, Erik', 'Elizondo, Guillermo', 'Vega, Libia']","['Alam-Escamilla D', 'Estrada-Muniz E', 'Solis-Villegas E', 'Elizondo G', 'Vega L']","['Departamento de Toxicologia, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Av.

The disease is clinically heterogeneous and incurable by standard chemotherapy. A major feature of the disease is the marked dependence of the leukaemic cells on various microenvironmental stimuli, which promote leukaemia cell growth, survival, and drug-resistance. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive CLL. The identification of recurrent genetic lesions using next generation sequencing technology has provided new data on the pathophysiology of the disease and has improved its prognostication. The recognition of the critical role of the B cell receptor (BCR) in driving the disease has resulted in the development of BCR pathway inhibitors that have the potential to completely transform CLL treatment in the near future. Other novel therapeutic agents, such as BCL2 antagonists and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cells, are also showing great promise in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize some of these recent advances, with a particular focus on the BCR and corresponding pathway inhibitors.","['Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Laurenti, Luca']","['Efremov DG', 'Laurenti L']","['Molecular Haematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology, A.

We observed that HOXC6 is differentially over-expressed in breast cancer tissue. E2 induces HOXC6 expression in cultured breast cancer cells and in mammary glands of Sprague Dawley rats. HOXC6 expression is also induced upon exposure to BPA both in vitro and in vivo. Estrogen-receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and ER-coregulators such as MLL-histone methylases are bound to the HOXC6 promoter upon exposure to E2 or BPA and that resulted in increased histone H3K4-trimethylation, histone acetylation, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the HOXC6 promoter. HOXC6 overexpression induces expression of tumor growth factors and facilitates growth 3D-colony formation, indicating its potential roles in tumor growth.

Mitochondria are the most prominent source of intracellular ROS and important regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Due to the increased oxidants near and within the mitochondria, we hypothesized that the mitochondria are a target of the pro-oxidative activity of MnTE-2-PyP(5+) and that we could exploit this effect to enhance the chemotherapeutic response in lymphoma. In this study, we demonstrate that MnTE-2-PyP(5+) modulates the mitochondrial redox environment and sensitizes lymphoma cells to antilymphoma chemotherapeutics. MnTE-2-PyP(5+) increased dexamethasone-induced mitochondrial ROS and oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool in lymphoma cells. The combination treatment induced glutathionylation of Complexes I, III, and IV in the electron transport chain, and decreased the activity of Complexes I and III, but not the activity of Complex IV. Treatment with the porphyrin and dexamethasone also decreased cellular ATP levels. Rho(0) malignant T-cells with impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain function were less sensitive to the combination treatment than wild-type cells. These findings suggest that mitochondria are important for the porphyrin's ability to enhance cell death. MnTE-2-PyP(5+) also augmented the effects of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), an antiglycolytic agent. In combination with 2DG, MnTE-2-PyP(5+) increased protein glutathionylation, decreased ATP levels more than 2DG treatment alone, and enhanced 2DG-induced cell death in primary B-ALL cells. MnTE-2-PyP(5+) did not enhance dexamethasone- or 2DG-induced cell death in normal cells.

It usually occurs in central and peripheral nervous system or soft tissue and bone, while intravenous or intracavitary PNET is considered as an extremely rare tumor. We reported a case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with the left unilateral facial and neck swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tape-shaped solid mass within left subclavian vein, left brachiocephalic vein, superior vena cava, and right atrium; the proximal end proportion occupied almost the entire right atrium with a pedicle flip protruded into the right ventricle. Ultrasonography revealed an irregular hypoechnoic mass arising from the left subclavian vein, which extended along the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava into the right atrium and up to the right ventricle. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed several hypermetabolic thyroid nodules with no evidence of intravenous hyperactive lesion. The patient underwent tumor resection under cardiopulmonary bypass. At 15 days postoperatively, total thyroidectomy and resection of the left subclavian vein were simultaneously performed. The patient received chemotherapy and radiotherapy later. Histologically, the neoplasm displayed small, round, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The neoplastic cells showed a strong immunopositivity for CD99, synaptophysin, CD56, CD57, and friend leukemia integration 1, thus confirming a diagnosis of the PNET. Histopathological examination of the thyroid showed papillary carcinoma. Thus, this PNET had no definitive organ or tissue of origin, which primarily originated from the left subclavian vein with tumor extension along the superior vena cava to the right ventricle.","['Wang, Jian', 'Wang, Weici', 'Li, Yiqing', 'Jin, Bi', 'Yu, Miao', 'Liu, Wenqi', 'Yao, Shaohua', 'Liao, Yonggui', 'Ouyang, Chenxi']","['Wang J', 'Wang W', 'Li Y', 'Jin B', 'Yu M', 'Liu W', 'Yao S', 'Liao Y', 'Ouyang C']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Currently, these types of CLL are treated with approaches that do not target the p53 pathway, such as small molecules and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). We have previously postulated anti-CCR7 mAb therapy as a novel CLL treatment. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of anti-CCR7 mAb as a single agent in CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics and/or refractory to fludarabine, by measuring CCR7 surface expression and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that CCR7 is highly expressed in challenging and heavily treated CLL patients. In addition, the complement-mediated mechanism of action of this mAb effectively eradicates CLL cells while sparing subsets of T cells in these patients. Moreover, this mAb outperformed the activity of alemtuzumab, the mAb with the highest efficacy in these groups. Finally, in vitro activity was also demonstrated in patients with a disease refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab, and patients harboring 11q22 deletion. Our results propose that anti-CCR7 mAb is an effective and promising future treatment in high-risk CLL.","['Cuesta-Mateos, Carlos', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Kreutzman, Anna', 'Colom-Fernandez, Beatriz', 'Portero-Sainz, Itxaso', 'Perez-Villar, Juan Jose', 'Terron, Fernando', 'Munoz-Calleja, Cecilia']","['Cuesta-Mateos C', 'Loscertales J', 'Kreutzman A', 'Colom-Fernandez B', 'Portero-Sainz I', 'Perez-Villar JJ', 'Terron F', 'Munoz-Calleja C']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Departamento de Inmunologia, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, C/Diego de Leon 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain, carlos.cuesta@salud.madrid.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150228,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, CCR7/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",,2015/03/01 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/03/01 06:00'],"['2014/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-015-1670-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2015 Jun;64(6):665-76. doi: 10.1007/s00262-015-1670-z.

To date the stem cell that undergoes the spatial and temporal chain of events during the development of this disease has not been identified. Here we describe a CD133(+) stem cell population that drives the pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis. Patient-derived circulating CD133(+) but not CD34(+)CD133(-) cells, with a variable burden for JAK2 (V617F) mutation, had multipotent cloning capacity in vitro. CD133(+) cells engrafted for up to 10 months in immunocompromised mice and differentiated into JAK2-V617F(+) myeloid but not lymphoid progenitors. We observed the persistence of human, atypical JAK2-V617F(+) megakaryocytes, the initiation of a prefibrotic state, bone marrow/splenic fibrosis and transition to acute myeloid leukemia. Leukemic cells arose from a subset of CD133(+) cells harboring EZH2 (D265H) but lacking a secondary JAK2 (V617F) mutation, consistent with the hypothesis that deregulation of EZH2 activity drives clonal growth and increases the risk of acute myeloid leukemia. This is the first characterization of a patient-derived stem cell population that drives disease resembling both chronic and acute phases of primary myelofibrosis in mice. These results reveal the importance of the CD133 antigen in deciphering the neoplastic clone in primary myelofibrosis and indicate a new therapeutic target for myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Triviai, Ioanna', 'Stubig, Thomas', 'Niebuhr, Birte', 'Hussein, Kais', 'Tsiftsoglou, Asterios', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Triviai I', 'Stubig T', 'Niebuhr B', 'Hussein K', 'Tsiftsoglou A', 'Fehse B', 'Stocking C', 'Kroger N']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece itriviai@gmail.com.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', 'Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', 'Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150227,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/*blood', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*blood/*diagnosis']",PMC4450622,2015/03/01 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/03/01 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.118463 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.118463 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jun;100(6):768-79. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.118463.

This single-center phase I/II study was designed to test the safety and efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with HyperCVAD chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-four patients were treated; 15 received everolimus 5 mg/day and 9 received 10 mg/day with HyperCVAD. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 25 years (range, 11-64) and median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1-7). Grade 3 mucositis was the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated everolimus dose was 5 mg/day. Responses included complete remission (CR) in 6 patients (25%), CR without platelet recovery (CRp) in 1 (4%), and CR without recovery of counts (CRi) in 1 (4%), for an overall response rate of 33%. In addition, partial response (PR) was noted in 2 patients (8%). Seven of 11 patients treated in first salvage achieved CR/CRp (64%). The median OS was 29 weeks for patients in first salvage versus 15 weeks for patients in second salvage and beyond (P </= 0.001). A response was noted in 5 of 10 (50%) heavily pretreated T-ALL patients (median of 4 prior salvage regimens). Everolimus significantly inhibited phosphorylation of S6RP, but this did not correlate with response. No significant decreases in p4EBP1 and pAkt levels were noted. Responders had higher everolimus dose-adjusted area under the curve (P = 0.025) and lower clearance (P = 0.025) than nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of HyperCVAD and everolimus is well tolerated and moderately effective in relapsed ALL, specifically T-ALL.","['Daver, Naval', 'Boumber, Yanis', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Rytting, Michael E', 'Kawedia, Jitesh D', 'Basnett, Jordan', 'Culotta, Kirk S', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Lu, Hongbo', 'Richie, Mary Ann', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Liu, Wenbin', 'Baggerly, Keith A', 'Jabbour, Elias', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Burger, Jan', 'Bendall, Linda J', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Daver N', 'Boumber Y', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Rytting ME', 'Kawedia JD', 'Basnett J', 'Culotta KS', 'Zeng Z', 'Lu H', 'Richie MA', 'Garris R', 'Xiao L', 'Liu W', 'Baggerly KA', 'Jabbour E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Burger J', 'Bendall LJ', 'Thomas D', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Program, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmacy Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. mkonople@mdanderson.org debthomas@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. mkonople@mdanderson.org debthomas@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150227,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Dexamethasone', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine', 'Young Adult']",PMC4470787,2015/03/01 06:00,2016/05/20 06:00,['2015/03/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-2888 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2888 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Jun 15;21(12):2704-14. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2888.

We identified miR-137 and miR-197, mapped to the chromosome 1p (12)-(21) deletion region, and examined their antimyeloma activity as tumor suppressors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of miR-137/197 was examined in multiple myeloma and normal plasma cells by qRT-PCR. Functional effect of miR-137/197 was analyzed by cell viability, apoptosis, clonogenic, and migration assays. Antimyeloma activity of miR-137/197 was further evaluated in vivo by lentiviral-based or lipid-based delivery in a mouse xenograft model of multiple myeloma. RESULTS: miR-137/197 expression was significantly lower in multiple myeloma cell lines and multiple myeloma patient samples compared with normal plasma cells. Transfection of miR-137/197 resulted in reduction of MCL-1 protein expression, as well as alteration of apoptosis-related genes, and induction of apoptosis, inhibition of viability, colony formation, and migration in multiple myeloma cells. MCL-1 was further validated as a direct target of miR-137/197. Conversely, overexpression of MCL-1 partially reverted the effect of miR-137/197. Importantly, in vivo lentiviral-mediated or intratumor delivery of miR-137/197 induced regression of tumors in murine xenograft models of multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a novel role of miR-137/197 as tumor suppressors in mediating apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells by targeting MCL-1. Our findings provide a proof-of-principle that lentivirus-based or formulated synthetic miR-137/197 exerts therapeutic activity in preclinical models, and support a framework for development of miR-137/197-based treatment strategies in patients with multiple myeloma.","['Yang, Yijun', 'Li, Fei', 'Saha, Manujendra N', 'Abdi, Jahangir', 'Qiu, Lugui', 'Chang, Hong']","['Yang Y', 'Li F', 'Saha MN', 'Abdi J', 'Qiu L', 'Chang H']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Toronto General Research Institute, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Toronto General Research Institute, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Toronto General Research Institute, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

METHODS: Three studies were analyzed. Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, four-way crossover study in 44 healthy participants. Study 2 was a randomized, repeat-dose crossover study in 16 patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib dose was 420 mg in both studies. Study 3 was an open-label, sequential study to assess the effect of a standard breakfast on ibrutinib 560 mg in eight healthy participants. RESULTS: Administration of single-dose ibrutinib under fasting conditions (study 1) resulted in approximately 60 % of exposure compared with drug intake either 30 min before, 30 min after (fed), or 2 h after a high-fat meal. Similar food effect was observed (study 3) when ibrutinib was given 30 min before meal. In CLL patients (study 2), the C max and AUC under fasting conditions were 43 and 61 %, respectively, relative to fed conditions. When administered once-daily in uncontrolled food-intake conditions (>/=30 min before or 2 h after), exposures were slightly ( approximately 30 %) lower than in fed condition. When corrected for repeated dosing, pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy participants and patients were comparable. Ibrutinib was generally well tolerated in all settings studied. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib administered in fasted condition reduces exposure to approximately 60 % as compared with dosing in proximity to food-intake, regardless of timing/type of meal. Because repeated drug intake in fasted condition is unlikely, no food restrictions may be needed to administer ibrutinib.","['de Jong, Jan', 'Sukbuntherng, Juthamas', 'Skee, Donna', 'Murphy, Joe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Byrd, John C', 'James, Danelle', 'Hellemans, Peter', 'Loury, David J', 'Jiao, Juhui', 'Chauhan, Vijay', 'Mannaert, Erik']","['de Jong J', 'Sukbuntherng J', 'Skee D', 'Murphy J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Byrd JC', 'James D', 'Hellemans P', 'Loury DJ', 'Jiao J', 'Chauhan V', 'Mannaert E']","['Janssen Research & Development, LLC, La Jolla, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA, jdejong1@its.jnj.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150228,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Fasting/metabolism', 'Female', '*Food-Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",PMC4419161,2015/03/01 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/03/01 06:00'],"['2015/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-015-2708-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 May;75(5):907-16. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2708-9.

The latter method is costly, time-demanding and dangerous for the personnel. However, slaughterhouses could be an alternative sampling point for this population. To assess the cost-effectiveness and sensitivity of such an approach, surveillance using slaughterhouse sampling was modelled with data from the 2012 Swiss animal movement database (AMD). We simulated a cross-sectional study for bluetongue (BT), and surveillance programmes to substantiate freedom from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL) (combined) to compare the outcome of random on-farm sampling versus slaughterhouse sampling. We found that, under Swiss conditions, slaughterhouse sampling results in low herd-level sensitivities because animals are sent by owners to slaughter individually and not in large groups, restricting the number of samples per herd. This makes slaughterhouse sampling inappropriate for prevalence surveys at the herd-level. However, for prevalence surveys at the animal-level and for substantiation of freedom from disease, slaughterhouse surveillance is equally or more cost-efficient than on-farm sampling.","['Scharrer, Sara', 'Schwermer, Heinzpeter', 'Presi, Patrick', 'Lindberg, Ann', 'Zinsstag, Jakob', 'Reist, Martin']","['Scharrer S', 'Schwermer H', 'Presi P', 'Lindberg A', 'Zinsstag J', 'Reist M']","['Veterinary Public Health Institute, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.

This study was aimed to determine the antiproliferative effects of four extracts from the fruits and barks of Zanthoxyllum heitzii (Rutaceae) on apoptosis in human promyelocytic cells, their mechanisms and the chemical composition. The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the fifty percent inhibition (IC50) concentration of the cell lines after treatment. The effect on morphology was observed using a light or fluorescence microscopy. The rate of apoptosis and the cell cycle were measured using flow cytometry (FCM). The phytochemical analysis of the extract was carried with HPLC/MS methods. RESULTS: The phytochemical analysis of the extracts indicated the presence of four known polyphenols (Syringic acid, Juglon, Luteolin and Myricetin) in both fruits and barks of Z. heitzii but in different quantities. Syringic acid and Myricetin concentrations were between 17-21 fold higher in the fruits than the stem bark. Rhamnetin (393.35 mug/mL) and Oleuropein (63.10 mug/mL) were identified only in the stem barks of Z. heitzii. Among the four extracts tested for cytotoxicity properties, only the methanol extract of fruits and barks significantly inhibited cell proliferation of HL-60 cells with IC50 value of 20 mug/mL and 12 mug/mL respectively. HL-60 cells treated with Z. heitzii extracts significantly produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) with concurrent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Modifications in the DNA distribution and enhanced of G1/G0 phase cell cycle arrest were observed in a concentration dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Polyphenols from Z. heitzii plant exert inhibitory effect on HL-60 cells through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle destabilization.","['Pieme, Constant Anatole', 'Santosh, Guru Kumar', 'Tekwu, Emmanuel Mouafo', 'Askun, Tulin', 'Aydeniz, Hatice', 'Ngogang, Jeanne Yonkeu', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar']","['Pieme CA', 'Santosh GK', 'Tekwu EM', 'Askun T', 'Aydeniz H', 'Ngogang JY', 'Bhushan S', 'Saxena AK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde 1, PO BOX 1364, Yaounde, Cameroon. apieme@yahoo.fr.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu, 18001, India. apieme@yahoo.fr.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu, 18001, India. santoshkumarguru@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory for TB research, Biotechnology Centre, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde 1, PO BOX 812, Yaounde, Cameroon. etekwu@yahoo.fr.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences and Arts, University of Balikesir, Cagis Campus, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey. etekwu@yahoo.fr.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences and Arts, University of Balikesir, Cagis Campus, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey. tulaskun@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences and Arts, University of Balikesir, Cagis Campus, Balikesir, 10145, Turkey. haticeaydeniz@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde 1, PO BOX 1364, Yaounde, Cameroon. jngogang@yahoo.fr.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu, 18001, India. sbhushan@iiim.ac.in.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu, 18001, India. aksaxena@iiim.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141023,England,Biol Res,Biological research,9308271,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cameroon', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fruit/*chemistry', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Plant Bark/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Polyphenols/analysis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis', 'Spices/analysis', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Zanthoxylum/*chemistry']",PMC4335363,2015/02/28 06:00,2016/04/12 06:00,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/0717-6287-47-54 [doi]', '0717-6287-47-54 [pii]']",epublish,Biol Res. 2014 Oct 23;47:54. doi: 10.1186/0717-6287-47-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By converting PI(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(3,4)P2 at the plasma membrane, SHIP1 modifies PI3-kinase mediated signaling. We have recently demonstrated that SHIP1 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein and SHIP1 nuclear puncta partially colocalize with FLASH, a component of nuclear bodies. In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous SHIP1 localizes to intranucleolar regions of both normal and leukemic haematopoietic cells. In addition, we report that ectopically expressed SHIP1 accumulates in nucleolar cavities and colocalizes with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and components of PML nuclear bodies (e.g. SP100, SUMO-1 and CK2). Moreover, SHIP1 also colocalizes in nucleolar cavities with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. By using confocal microscopy data, we generated 3D-models revealing the enormous extent of the SHIP1 aggresomes in the nucleolus. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 causes an enlargement of nucleolar SHIP1 containing structures. Unexpectedly, this accumulation can be partially prevented by treatment with the inhibitor of nuclear protein export Leptomycin B. In recent years, several proteins aggregating in nucleolar cavities were shown to be key factors of neurodegenerative diseases and cancerogenesis. Our findings support current relevance of nuclear localized SHIP1.","['Ehm, Patrick', 'Nalaskowski, Marcus M', 'Wundenberg, Torsten', 'Jucker, Manfred']","['Ehm P', 'Nalaskowski MM', 'Wundenberg T', 'Jucker M']","['a Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction ; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf ; Hamburg , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150227,United States,Nucleus,"Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",101518322,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPP5D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inpp5d protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC4615814,2015/02/28 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19491034.2015.1022701 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleus. 2015;6(2):154-64. doi: 10.1080/19491034.2015.1022701.

While most efforts are directed at inferring drug response phenotype based on genotype, there is very focused and useful phenotypic information to be gained from directly perturbing the patient's living cancer cell with the drug(s) in question. To satisfy this unmet need, we developed the Dynamic BH3 Profiling technique to measure early changes in net pro-apoptotic signaling at the mitochondrion (""priming"") induced by chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells, not requiring prolonged ex vivo culture. We find in cell line and clinical experiments that early drug-induced death signaling measured by Dynamic BH3 Profiling predicts chemotherapy response across many cancer types and many agents, including combinations of chemotherapies. We propose that Dynamic BH3 Profiling can be used as a broadly applicable predictive biomarker to predict cytotoxic response of cancers to chemotherapeutics in vivo.","['Montero, Joan', 'Sarosiek, Kristopher A', 'DeAngelo, Joseph D', 'Maertens, Ophelia', 'Ryan, Jeremy', 'Ercan, Dalia', 'Piao, Huiying', 'Horowitz, Neil S', 'Berkowitz, Ross S', 'Matulonis, Ursula', 'Janne, Pasi A', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Cichowski, Karen', 'Drapkin, Ronny', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Montero J', 'Sarosiek KA', 'DeAngelo JD', 'Maertens O', 'Ryan J', 'Ercan D', 'Piao H', 'Horowitz NS', 'Berkowitz RS', 'Matulonis U', 'Janne PA', 'Amrein PC', 'Cichowski K', 'Drapkin R', 'Letai A']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', ""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', ""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Hematology/Oncology Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114,USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 30 patients. Twelve were clinically diagnosed as aplastic anemia and the 18 were of acute myeloid leukemia. A prospective 3 months follow-up was planned to monitor the response of platelet transfusion therapy, based on their posttransfusion corrected count increment at 1(st) and 24(th) h. Based on the observations, patients were categorized into refractory and nonrefractory groups. Common nonimmunological causes such as fever, sepsis, bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation, chemotherapy, splenomegaly, ABO mismatch, and antithymocyte globulin therapy were monitored. Among the immunological causes, presence of antihuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antibodies and platelet glycoprotein antibodies in patient's serum were monitored. RESULTS: During the study period, 17 (56.66%) patients did not show desired platelet count increment. Transfusion requirements of refractory group for both red cell and platelet product were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in comparison to nonrefractory group. Among immunological causes, anti HLA class I antibodies (P < 0.013), antihuman platelet antigen-5b antibodies (P < 0.033) were significantly associated with refractoriness. Among nonimmunological causes, bleeding (P < 0.019, odd ratio 8.7), fever (P < 0.08, odd ratio 5.2), and infection (P < 0.07, odd ratio 5.4) were found to associated with refractoriness. CONCLUSION: Platelet refractoriness should be suspected in multitransfused patients not showing expected increment in platelet counts and thoroughly investigated to frame further guidelines in order to ensure proper management of these kind of patients.","['Kumawat, Vijay', 'Sharma, Ratti Ram', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Marwaha, Neelam']","['Kumawat V', 'Sharma RR', 'Malhotra P', 'Marwaha N']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Asian J Transfus Sci,Asian journal of transfusion science,101306858,,,,PMC4339935,2015/02/28 06:00,2015/02/28 06:01,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-6247.150953 [doi]', 'AJTS-9-61 [pii]']",ppublish,Asian J Transfus Sci. 2015 Jan-Jun;9(1):61-4. doi: 10.4103/0973-6247.150953.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alloimmunization', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'aplastic anemia', 'multitransfused', 'platelet transfusion', 'refractoriness']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Muller cells, which exhibit morphologic and functional changes in prevalent retinal diseases, are implicated in their induction and action. METHODS: We characterized expression of endogenous IL-6/gp130 cytokines and Jak-STAT signaling after inducible Muller cell ablation in the neural retinas of adult mice. This resulted in photoreceptor apoptosis and reactive activation of surviving Muller cells. Analysis was performed by using a combination of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (rLIF) was intravitreally injected in an attempt to inhibit photoreceptor degeneration following selective Muller cell ablation. RESULTS: Significant differential expression (both increases and decreases) of multiple IL-6/gp130 cytokines, such as LIF, oncostatin-M, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, occurred after Muller cell ablation, with concomitant increase in signal transducers and activators of transcription and extracellular kinases 1 and 2, particularly in surviving, activated Muller cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor was robustly increased in photoreceptors after selective Muller cell ablation. Multiple injections of rLIF failed to prevent photoreceptor degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: These results further characterize expression of IL-6/gp130 cytokines and Jak-STAT signaling in outer retinal disease, suggesting Muller cells are critical for their induction and action. Lack of rLIF-mediated neuroprotection contrasts with other retinal degenerations where Muller cell integrity remains intact or photoreceptor apoptosis occurs in a more rapid, synchronous manner. The presence of Muller cells may be critical for the functional benefits of rLIF and potentially other IL-6/gp130 cytokines.","['Coorey, Nathan J', 'Shen, Weiyong', 'Zhu, Ling', 'Gillies, Mark C']","['Coorey NJ', 'Shen W', 'Zhu L', 'Gillies MC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ependymoglial Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retinal Degeneration/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,2015/02/28 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['iovs.14-15695 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.14-15695 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2015 Apr;56(4):2151-61. doi: 10.1167/iovs.14-15695.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This strategy has generally been successful, but is subject to drug resistance because of point mutations in the kinase domain. Kinase activity requires transactivation of BCR-ABL1 following an oligomerization event, which is mediated by the coiled-coil (CC) domain at the N terminus of the protein. Here, we describe a rationally engineered mutant version of the CC domain, called CC(mut3), which interferes with BCR-ABL1 oligomerization and promotes apoptosis in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells, regardless of kinase domain mutation status.

Moreover, CC(mut3) inhibits colony formation by primary CML CD34(+) cells ex vivo, including a sample expressing the T315I mutant.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy has produced exciting results in CD19+ malignancies and may overcome many of the limitations of conventional leukemia therapies. We developed CART cells to target CD33 (CART33) using the anti-CD33 single chain variable fragment used in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (clone My96) and tested the activity and toxicity of these cells. CART33 exhibited significant effector functions in vitro and resulted in eradication of leukemia and prolonged survival in AML xenografts. CART33 also resulted in human lineage cytopenias and reduction of myeloid progenitors in xenograft models of hematopoietic toxicity, suggesting that permanently expressed CD33-specific CART cells would have unacceptable toxicity. To enhance the viability of CART33 as an option for AML, we designed a transiently expressed mRNA anti-CD33 CAR. Gene transfer was carried out by electroporation into T cells and resulted in high-level expression with potent but self-limited activity against AML. Thus our preclinical studies show potent activity of CART33 and indicate that transient expression of anti-CD33 CAR by RNA modification could be used in patients to avoid long-term myelosuppression. CART33 therapy could be used alone or as part of a preparative regimen prior to allogeneic transplantation in refractory AML.","['Kenderian, S S', 'Ruella, M', 'Shestova, O', 'Klichinsky, M', 'Aikawa, V', 'Morrissette, J J D', 'Scholler, J', 'Song, D', 'Porter, D L', 'Carroll, M', 'June, C H', 'Gill, S']","['Kenderian SS', 'Ruella M', 'Shestova O', 'Klichinsky M', 'Aikawa V', 'Morrissette JJ', 'Scholler J', 'Song D', 'Porter DL', 'Carroll M', 'June CH', 'Gill S']","['1] Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA [2] Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '1] Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA [2] Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '1] Translational Research Program, Abramson Family Research Cancer Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA [2] Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150227,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4644600,2015/02/28 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201552 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.52 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1637-47. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.52.

We refined the World Health Organization (WHO)-classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) by determining the impact of the newer clinical and cytogenetic features, and we compared its prognostic power to that of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). A population of 5326 untreated MDS was considered. We analyzed single WPSS parameters and confirmed that the WHO classification and severe anemia provide important prognostic information in MDS. A strong correlation was found between the WPSS including the new cytogenetic risk stratification and WPSS adopting original criteria. We then compared WPSS with the IPSS-R prognostic system. A highly significant correlation was found between the WPSS and IPSS-R risk classifications. Discrepancies did occur among lower-risk patients in whom the number of dysplastic hematopoietic lineages as assessed by morphology did not reflect the severity of peripheral blood cytopenias and/or increased marrow blast count. Moreover, severe anemia has higher prognostic weight in the WPSS versus IPSS-R model. Overall, both systems well represent the prognostic risk of MDS patients defined by WHO morphologic criteria.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of Icariin on APL cells and to determine whether Icariin can potentiate the antitumor activity of ATO in APL cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of apoptosis and proliferation-related molecules was detected by Western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined with florescence staining. Icariin inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis in both of the tested APL cell lines. Icariin enhanced the in vitro antitumor activity of ATO against APL. The antitumor activity of Icariin and its enhancement of the antitumor activity of ATO correlated with the increase in accumulation of intracellular ROS. Our results showed that Icariin, by increasing intracellular ROS, exhibited antitumor activity and potentiated the antitumor activity of ATO against APL. Therefore, combination treatment with Icariin and ATO might offer a novel therapeutic option for patients with APL, although further studies are needed.","['Wang, Zhi', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Dai, Liling', 'Song, Tongguo', 'Li, Ping', 'Liu, Yali', 'Wang, Luning']","['Wang Z', 'Zhang H', 'Dai L', 'Song T', 'Li P', 'Liu Y', 'Wang L']","['Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China. drlilingdai@sina.com.', 'Emergency Department of Qingdao Emergency Center, Qingdao, 266035, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'VNM47R2QSQ (icariin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2015/02/28 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-015-0660-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-015-0660-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 Sep;73(1):213-9. doi: 10.1007/s12013-015-0660-2.,,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATO', 'Icariin', 'ROS', 'Synergistic effect']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 32 healthy subjects and 26 CML patients were evaluated before and after treatment with imatinib mesylate (IM) and dasatinib (DAS) by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Anti-apoptotic genes (c-FLIP and MCL-1) were overexpressed and the pro-apoptotic BIK was reduced in CML patients. Expression of BMF, A1, c-FLIP, MCL-1, CIAP-2 and CIAP-1 was modulated by DAS. In IM-resistant patients, expression of A1, c-FLIP, CIAP-1 and MCL-1 was upregulated, and BCL-2, CIAP-2, BAK, BAX, BIK and FASL expression was downregulated. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results point out that, in CML, DAS interferes with the apoptotic machinery regulation.

Inadequate HSC mobilization can be seen with the standard use of granulocyte-colony-stimulating (G-CSF). Plerixafor (PL) is a chemokine receptor CXC Type 4-stromal-derived factor 1 inhibitor; its HSC-mobilizing properties are synergistic with G-CSF in poor mobilizing patients. The use of PL as adjuvant or alternative to G-CSF in healthy donors has shown a good safety profile but is so far off-label. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We report 10 healthy HSC donors treated with PL because of insufficient response to G-CSF alone or contraindication to G-CSF. Eight donors did not mobilize enough CD34+ cells with G-CSF alone because poor mobilizers or because insufficient HSCs were harvested according to the clinical need of the patient; in two cases G-CSF administration and marrow harvest were unfeasible or contraindicated in the donor. RESULTS: The use of PL for mobilization increased the number of circulating CD34+ cells by 2.8-fold and the CD34+/kg collection by 3.0-fold. Only mild adverse events were reported (bone pain or discomfort) and not univocally attributable to PL. Rate of engraftment and graft-versus-host disease were similar to those seen in recipients of grafts from G-CSF only-mobilized donors. CONCLUSION: We exposed 10 allogeneic donors to mobilization with PL. PL was well tolerated in all cases and ensured procurement of an adequate graft for transplantation resulting in a normal hematopoietic engraftment.","['Gattillo, Salvatore', 'Marktel, Sarah', 'Rizzo, Lorenzo', 'Malato, Simona', 'Malabarba, Lucia', 'Coppola, Milena', 'Assanelli, Andrea', 'Milani, Raffaella', 'De Freitas, Tiago', 'Corti, Consuelo', 'Bellio, Laura', 'Ciceri, Fabio']","['Gattillo S', 'Marktel S', 'Rizzo L', 'Malato S', 'Malabarba L', 'Coppola M', 'Assanelli A', 'Milani R', 'De Freitas T', 'Corti C', 'Bellio L', 'Ciceri F']","['Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20150226,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Benzylamines', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/therapy', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/therapy', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Parents', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Siblings', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/02/28 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/02/28 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.13059 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2015 Aug;55(8):1993-2000. doi: 10.1111/trf.13059.

METHOD: Enrolled 107 patients (age: 65-82 years) received DAC (52/107) or DAC plus thalidomide (55/107) therapy for MDS. RESULTS: 35/52 patients (67.3%) with DAC therapy reached overall response (OR), compared with 36/55 patients (65.5%) in DAC+thalidomide regimen (P>0.05). DAC+thalidomide administered did not gain more profits of PFS and OS than DAC monotherapy. Risk-tailored analysis showed that DAC+thalidomide therapy did not enhance PFS (48.9% versus 42.8%, P>0.05) and OS (78.6% versus 71.2%, P>0.05) when compared with simple DAC regimen. Nevertheless, DAC+thalidomide markedly improved OS over DAC monotherapy (50.6% versus 40.2%, P<0.05) in high risk profile. Meanwhile, low risk group was superior to high risk group in AML-FS (57.2% versus 21.3%, P<0.01), but DAC+thalidomide still did not prolong 2-year AML-FS when compared with DAC (32.4% versus 27.8%, P<0.05). Moreover, thalidomide had a favorable toxicity profile as a single agent. In comparison with DAC monotherapy, the DAC+thalidomide regimen was relatively well tolerated.

OBJECTIVE: The first aim was to quantify the amount of podophyllotoxin and deoxypodophyllotoxin in 61 Juniperus (Cupressaceae) samples. Cytotoxic activity of podophyllotoxin and ethanolic leaf extracts of Juniperus scopulorum Sarg. ""Blue Pacific"" and Juniperus communis L. ""Depressa Aurea"" was examined against different leukemia cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis was performed with the use of a Waters ACQUITY UPLC(TM) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The peaks of podophyllotoxin and deoxypodophyllotoxin were assigned on the basis of their retention data and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Trypan blue assay was performed to obtain IC50 cytotoxicity values against selected leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: Juniperus scopulorum was characterized with the highest level of podophyllotoxin (486.7 mg/100 g DW) while Juniperus davurica Pall. contained the highest amount of deoxypodophyllotoxin (726.8 mg/100 g DW). Podophyllotoxin IC50 cytotoxicity values against J45.01 and CEM/C1 leukemia cell lines were 0.0040 and 0.0286 microg/mL, respectively. Juniperus scopulorum extract examined against J45.01 and HL-60/MX2 leukemia cell lines gave the respective IC50 values: 0.369-9.225 microg/mL. Juniperus communis extract was characterized with the following IC50 cytotoxity values against J45.01 and U-266B1 cell lines: 3.310-24.825 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Juniperus sp. can be considered as an alternative source of podophyllotoxin and deoxypodophyllotoxin.

Human Threonine Aspartase1 processes substrates, such as the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein, containing two cleavage sites, CS1 and CS2. Likewise, MLL's Drosophila ortholog trithorax is cleaved by Drosophila Threonine Aspartase1 (dTasp), suggesting a mechanistic coevolution. However, a detailed analysis of dTasp's function was missing so far. Here, active and inactive dTasp mutants allowed to compare substrate recognition and cleavage site selectivity of human and Drosophila enzymes. In contrast to the human protease, our cell-based assay revealed a preferential processing of CS2-like (QLD downward arrowGx[xD/Dx]) targets for dTasp, whereas cleavage of CS1-like targets (QVD downward arrowGx[xD/Dx]) was significantly impaired. Systematic mutagenesis of the CS2 sequence defined the motif x[FILMW]D downward arrowGx[xD/Dx] as the consensus cleavage sequence for dTasp. Substrate species selectivity of the enzymes was uncovered by demonstrating that dTasp cleaves Drosophila TFIIA, but not the human ortholog, suggesting evolutionary divergence of TFIIA downstream networks. Also, Drosophila USF2 was neither predicted nor cleaved by dTasp. Moreover, we found that dTasp cleavage site selectivity is independent of heterocomplex formation, as dTasp exists predominantly as an alphabeta-monomer. Collectively, we provide novel insights into evolutionary similarities and divergence concerning Threonine Aspartase1 function in different species, which may aid to dissect and better target human Threonine Aspartase1 in malignancies.","['Wunsch, Desiree', 'Hahlbrock, Angelina', 'Heiselmayer, Christina', 'Backer, Sandra', 'Schrenk, Christian', 'Benne, Franziska', 'Schilling, Oliver', 'Knauer, Shirley K']","['Wunsch D', 'Hahlbrock A', 'Heiselmayer C', 'Backer S', 'Schrenk C', 'Benne F', 'Schilling O', 'Knauer SK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIIA)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Drosophila/chemistry/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Species Specificity', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factor TFIIA/metabolism', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors/metabolism']",,2015/02/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/hsz-2014-0318 [doi]', '/j/bchm.just-accepted/hsz-2014-0318/hsz-2014-0318.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Chem. 2015 Apr;396(4):367-76. doi: 10.1515/hsz-2014-0318.,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4321-0924'],,,,,,,,,,

Literature on the underlying causes of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia, in both malignant and benign conditions, is limited to small case series and case reports. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to systematically identify a large series of cases of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia and to document differences in demographics and the clinical course between malignant and benign etiologies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This was a hospital-based, retrospective case series that identified subjects from 1999 to 2010 from the public hospital system in Queensland, Australia. Included subjects were 18 years and older and had persistent hypercalcemia with simultaneously elevated PTHrP. RESULTS: A total of 138 cases were identified. Solid organ malignancies made up 82.6% (n = 114) of cases, with squamous cell carcinoma (28.2% of total) and adenocarcinomas (27.5%) almost equally as common. Hematological malignancy and benign conditions made up 8.7% (n = 12) each. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was the single most commonly identified etiology (10.9%). Causes not previously identified included myxoid sarcoma, plasma cell leukemia, duodenal adenocarcinoma, metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Median survival was different among the groups (52 days [interquartile range, 21-132 days] for solid organ malignancy, 362 days [18-652 days] for hematological malignancy, and 906 days [16 days to undefined] for the apparently benign group; P < .0001). There were no differences in PTHrP among the groups. Although the mean corrected calcium level was lower in the benign group (3.03 mmol/L [2.80-3.29 mmol/L]) compared with that in the solid organ (3.11 mmol/L [2.89-3.46 mmol/L]) and hematological malignancy groups (3.60 mmol/L [3.01-3.79 mmol/L]) groups (P = .046), it was not a useful discriminator of etiology. CONCLUSION: PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia is most frequently caused by solid organ malignancy, and it portends a poor prognosis. Although the solid organ malignancy group had the shortest survival, the hematological malignancy and apparently benign causes groups still had relatively short overall survival.","['Donovan, Peter J', 'Achong, Naomi', 'Griffin, Katherine', 'Galligan, John', 'Pretorius, Carel J', 'McLeod, Donald S A']","['Donovan PJ', 'Achong N', 'Griffin K', 'Galligan J', 'Pretorius CJ', 'McLeod DS']","[""Departments of Internal Medicine and Aged Care and Diabetes and Endocrinology (P.J.D., D.S.A.M.), Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Queensland 4029, Australia; School of Medicine (P.J.D., N.A., C.J.P., D.S.A.M.), University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland 4029, Australia; Gold Coast University Hospital (K.G.), Gold Coast, Queensland 4215, Australia; Department of Chemical Pathology (J.G., C.J.P.), Pathology Queensland, Herston, Queensland 4029, Australia; and Cancer Care Group (D.S.A.M.), Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Herston, Queensland 4029, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150226,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Calcium/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/blood/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*complications/mortality', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/02/27 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/jc.2014-4250 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 May;100(5):2024-9. doi: 10.1210/jc.2014-4250.

Previous reports have demonstrated that PHGDH plays an important role in some malignancies. However, the biological role of PHGDH in human cervical adenocarcinoma has not been explored. We examined the expression of PHGDH in 54 cervical adenocarcinoma samples by immunohistochemistry and evaluated the association with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. We performed shRNA transfection to knock down PHGDH gene expression in HeLa cells. A cell proliferation test, cisplatin cytotoxicity test and apoptosis test examined the HeLa cell line after PHGDH knockdown in vitro. In vivo tumorigenesis was assessed using a mouse xenograft model. Moreover, we examined the effects on Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 expression after knockdown of PHGDH and treatment of cisplatin for 48h by Western blot. In this study, we demonstrated that elevated PHGDH expression was found in cervical adenocarcinoma and was associated with tumor size and prognosis. Knocking down PHGDH in HeLa cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and increased cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity. Silencing PHGDH resulted in inhibition of tumorigenesis in vivo. Furthermore, PHGDH knockdown reduced Bcl-2 and increased cleaved caspase-3 expression. Collectively, our study indicates the novel roles of PHGDH in cervical adenocarcinoma and identifies PHGDH as a new anticancer target.","['Jing, Zhang', 'Heng, Wei', 'Xia, Liu', 'Ning, Wang', 'Yafei, Qi', 'Yao, Zhang', 'Shulan, Zhang']","['Jing Z', 'Heng W', 'Xia L', 'Ning W', 'Yafei Q', 'Yao Z', 'Shulan Z']","['a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Shengjing Hospital; China Medical University ; Shenyang , Liaoning , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150226,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.1.1.95 (Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",PMC4622468,2015/02/27 06:00,2016/01/21 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1017690 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(4):541-8. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1017690.

In general, knowledge of the conditional survival probabilities of a patient at all relevant time points allows better assessment of the patient's risk than summary statistics, such as median survival time. Nevertheless, standard methods for analysing survival data seldom estimate the survivor function directly. Therefore, we propose the application of conditional transformation models (CTMs) for the estimation of the conditional distribution function of survival times given a set of patient characteristics. We used the inverse probability of censoring weighting approach to account for right-censored observations. Our proposed modelling approach allows the prediction of patient-specific survivor functions. In addition, CTMs constitute a flexible model class that is able to deal with proportional as well as non-proportional hazards. The well-known Cox model is included in the class of CTMs as a special case. We investigated the performance of CTMs in survival data analysis in a simulation that included proportional and non-proportional hazard settings and different scenarios of explanatory variables. Furthermore, we re-analysed the survival times of patients suffering from chronic myelogenous leukaemia and studied the impact of the proportional hazards assumption on previously published results.","['Most, Lisa', 'Hothorn, Torsten']","['Most L', 'Hothorn T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Int J Biostat,The international journal of biostatistics,101313850,,IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', '*Models, Statistical', '*Survival Analysis']",,2015/02/27 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/ijb-2014-0006 [doi]', '/j/ijb.ahead-of-print/ijb-2014-0006/ijb-2014-0006.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Biostat. 2015 May;11(1):23-50. doi: 10.1515/ijb-2014-0006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study is on patients managed for Fournier's gangrene from January 2002 to December 2012. The demographics, clinical presentation, management and outcome were recorded in a proforma and the data obtained were analyzed using SPSS 10.0 software. RESULTS: Fournier's gangrene represented 1.8% of hospitalizations with an annual average of 5 cases. The mean age was 52 years with range of 21 - 85 years. 77.7% of patients were 40 - 59 years and; while 22.3% were 60 years and above. About 28% had a predisposing factor (diabetis, HIV, leukaemia, high blood pressure). Etiological factors were urogenital (42.5%), anorectal (22.5%), and cutaneous (17.5%). In 17.5% of cases, no etiologic factor was found. The diagnosis was clinically obvious because of late presentation, 95% of patients were admitted in the acute phase. CONCLUSION: Fournier's gangrene mostly affects young males and the diagnosis was clinical.

We perform an empirical study to validate the argument and show that structured data alone is insufficient in resolving eligibility criteria for recruiting patients onto clinical trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and prostate cancer. Unstructured data is essential to solving 59% of the CLL trial criteria and 77% of the prostate cancer trial criteria.

National cancer incidence and mortality were compiled and cancer incident new cases and cancer deaths were estimated. METHODS: In 2014, there were 234 cancer registries submitted cancer incidence and deaths occurred in 2011. All datasets were checked and evaluated based on the criteria of data quality from NCCR. Total 177 registries' data were qualified and compiled for cancer statistics in 2011. The pooled data were stratified by area (urban/rural), gender, age group (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14...85+) and cancer type. Cancer incident cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and national population in 2011. All incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 Chinese standard population and Segi's population expressed per 100,000 persons. RESULTS: All 177 cancer registries (77 in urban and 100 in rural areas) covered 175,310,169 populations (98,341,507 in urban and 76,968,662 in rural areas). The morphology verified cases (MV%) accounting for 70.14% and 2.44% of incident cases were identified through death certifications only (DCO%) with mortality to incidence ratio of 0.63. The estimates of new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 3,372,175 and 2,113,048 in 2011, respectively. The incidence rate was 250.28/100,000 (males 277.77/100,000, females 221.37/100,000), and the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 186.34/100,000 and 182.76/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) of 21.20%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC in urban areas were 261.38/100,000 and 189.89/100,000 compared to 238.60/100,000 and 182.10/100,000 in rural areas, respectively. The cancer mortality was 156.83/100,000 (194.88/100,000 in males and 116.81/100,000 in females), the age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 112.88/100,000 and 111.82/100,000, and the cumulative mortality rate (0-74 years old) was 12.69%. The cancer mortality and ASMRC were 154.37/100,000 and 108.20/100,000 in urban areas, and 159.42/100,000 and 117.97/100,000 in rural areas, respectively. Cancers of lung, female breast, stomach, liver, colon and rectum, esophageal, cervix, uterus, prostate and ovary were the most common cancers, accounting for about 75% of all cancer new cases. Lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, female breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, cervical cancer and leukemia were the leading causes of cancer death, accounting for about 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer incidence, mortality and spectrum showed difference between urban and rural areas, males and females. CONCLUSIONS: The coverage of cancer registration population had a greater increase than that in the last year. The data quality and representativeness are gradually improved. As the basic work of cancer prevention and control, cancer registry is playing an irreplaceable role. The disease burden of cancer is increasing, and the health department has to take effective measures to contain the increased cancer burden in China.","['Chen, Wanqing', 'Zheng, Rongshou', 'Zeng, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Siwei', 'He, Jie']","['Chen W', 'Zheng R', 'Zeng H', 'Zhang S', 'He J']","['National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing 100021, China.', 'National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing 100021, China.', 'National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing 100021, China.', 'National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing 100021, China.', 'National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing 100021, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,PMC4329176,2015/02/27 06:00,2015/02/27 06:01,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2015.01.06 [doi]', 'cjcr-27-01-002 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2015 Feb;27(1):2-12. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2015.01.06.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer registry', 'China', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'mortality']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although rather helpful, the use of conventional immunosuppressive drugs leads to general immunosuppression and is toxic. The effects of CD4(+) T-cells, in respect to the development of aGvHD, can be altered by administration of antihuman CD4 monoclonal antibodies, here MAX.16H5 IgG1 . This approach must be tested for possible interference with the Graft-versus-Leukemia-Effect (GvL). Thus, in vitro experiments were conducted, exposing P815 leukemic cells to bone marrow and splenocytes from cd4(-/-) -C57Bl/6 mice transgenic for human CD4 and HLA-DR3 (triple transgenic mice, [TTG]) as well as previously irradiated splenocytes from Balb/c(wt) mice. Using flow cytometry, the vitality of the various malignant and graft cells was analyzed over the course of 4 days. The survival rate of P815 cells did not change significantly when exposed to MAX.16H5 IgG1 , neither did the viability of the graft cells. This provides evidence that MAX.16H5 IgG1 does not impair the GvL effect in vitro. Additionally, P815-Balb/c(wt) leukemic mice were transplanted with P815(GFP) cells, bone marrow, and splenocytes from TTG mice with and without MAX.16H5 IgG1 . Without transplantation, P815(GFP) leukemic cells could be detected by flow cytometry in the liver, the bone marrow, and the spleen of recipients. The antibodies prevented aGvHD while leaving the GvL effect intact. These findings indicate no negative effect of MAX.16H5 IgG1 on the GvL effect in vitro and in vivo after HSCT in a murine model.","['Schmidt, Felix', 'Hilger, Nadja', 'Oelkrug, Christoper', 'Svanidze, Ellen', 'Ruschpler, Peter', 'Eichler, Wolfram', 'Boldt, Andreas', 'Emmrich, Frank', 'Fricke, Stephan']","['Schmidt F', 'Hilger N', 'Oelkrug C', 'Svanidze E', 'Ruschpler P', 'Eichler W', 'Boldt A', 'Emmrich F', 'Fricke S']","['Department of Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150224,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Hypomethylating agents, including decitabine are used to treat elderly AML patients with relative success. Targeting nuclear export receptor (exportin 1 [XPO1]) is a novel approach to restore tumor suppressor (TS) function in AML. Here, we show that sequential treatment of AML blasts with decitabine followed by selinexor (XPO1 inhibitor) enhances the antileukemic effects of selinexor. These effects could be mediated by the re-expression of a subset of TSs (CDKN1A and FOXO3A) that are epigenetically silenced via DNA methylation, and cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking is regulated by XPO1. We observed a significant upregulation of CDKN1A and FOXO3A in decitabine- versus control-treated cells. Sequential treatment of decitabine followed by selinexor in an MV4-11 xenograft model significantly improved survival compared with selinexor alone. On the basis of these preclinical results, a phase 1 clinical trial of decitabine followed by selinexor in elderly patients with AML has been initiated.","['Ranganathan, Parvathi', 'Yu, Xueyan', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Hofstetter, Jessica', 'Walker, Alison', 'Walsh, Katherine', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Devine, Steven', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Kauffman, Michael', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Blum, William', 'Garzon, Ramiro']","['Ranganathan P', 'Yu X', 'Santhanam R', 'Hofstetter J', 'Walker A', 'Walsh K', 'Bhatnagar B', 'Klisovic R', 'Vasu S', 'Phelps MA', 'Devine S', 'Shacham S', 'Kauffman M', 'Marcucci G', 'Blum W', 'Garzon R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'The College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc., Natick, MA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc., Natick, MA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150225,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '31TZ62FO8F (selinexor)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Karyopherins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC4408293,2015/02/27 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41237-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-607648 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 23;125(17):2689-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-607648.

The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool located in specialized anatomical sites within the BM is subjected to a complex network of chemokines, such that the produced chemokines affect the fate of these cells. Expression of different chemokine receptors on leukemic stem cells (LSCs) uncovers the critical role of chemokines in the maintenance, survival and fate of these cells in the leukemic niche. As a pre-metastatic niche rich in a variety of chemokines, the BM niche is turned into a locus of tumor cell development and division. The chemokine receptors expressed on the surface of metastatic cells lead to their metastasis and homing to the BM niche. Knowledge of chemokines and their receptors leads to the production of various therapeutic antagonists at chemokine receptors expressed on leukemic and tumor cells, enabling interference with chemokine function as a therapeutic tool. New findings suggest that miRNAs, with their specific inhibitory function, affect the ability of producing and expressing chemokines and chemokine receptors. This review focuses on the emerging role of chemokines and their receptors in normal and pathologic conditions of the BM niche, and also discusses the new therapeutic methods with this background.","['Ahmadzadeh, Ahmad', 'Kast, Richard E', 'Ketabchi, Neda', 'Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Shahjahani, Mohammad', 'Jaseb, Kaveh', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Ahmadzadeh A', 'Kast RE', 'Ketabchi N', 'Shahrabi S', 'Shahjahani M', 'Jaseb K', 'Saki N']","['Health research institute, Research Center of Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150226,Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Chemokines/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Stem Cell Niche']",,2015/02/27 06:00,2016/05/19 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00441-015-2129-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2015 Aug;361(2):401-10. doi: 10.1007/s00441-015-2129-4.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 1990 to 2013, the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, followed up 4422 patients with LPD. Lymphomas and leukemias were diagnosed using the universally protocols. Tuberculosis was verified by the results of a comprehensive examination involving the histological study of biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Tuberculosis was identified in 85 (2%) patients with LPD. According to the nosological entity, the tuberculosis detection rates were 3% (40/1350) in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 1.2% (20/1627) in aggressive lymphomas, 1.4% (16/1136) in mature cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 2.9% (9/309) in hairy cell leukemia. In accordance with its site, pulmonary tuberculosis was 73%; extrapulmonary tuberculosis, 14%; generalized tuberculosis, 12%. In pulmonary tuberculosis, its disseminated and focal involvements were found in 71 and 18% of cases, respectively. Tuberculosis was detected in 43% of the patients with HL in remission; it occurred only in other hemoblastoses in its active phase. When tuberculosis and LPD were simultaneously found, both diseases were concurrently treated. If the chemotherapy of LPD was effective, tuberculosis was cured in all the patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with LPD are a group at increased risk for tuberculosis. The diagnosis of recurrent LPD must be histologically proven. When tuberculosis and LPD are simultaneously found, both diseases should be concurrently treated.","['Al-Radi, L S', 'Moiseeva, T N', 'Chernova, N G', 'Sharkunov, N N', 'Margolin, O V', 'Shitareva, I V', 'Baryakh, E A', 'Klyasova, G A', 'Roshchina, L S', 'Kostina, I E', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Pivnik, A V', 'Vorobiov, A I']","['Al-Radi LS', 'Moiseeva TN', 'Chernova NG', 'Sharkunov NN', 'Margolin OV', 'Shitareva IV', 'Baryakh EA', 'Klyasova GA', 'Roshchina LS', 'Kostina IE', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Pivnik AV', 'Vorobiov AI']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Russia/epidemiology', 'Tuberculosis/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/epidemiology/etiology/therapy']",,2015/02/27 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2015/02/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2014;86(11):42-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is expressed in the vast majority of these acute myeloid leukemias and frequent activating KIT gene mutations have been associated with a higher risk of relapse. This phase II study aimed to evaluate dasatinib as maintenance therapy in patients with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia in first hematologic complete remission, but at higher risk of relapse due to molecular disease persistence or recurrence. A total of 26 patients aged 18-60 years old previously included in the CBF-2006 trial were eligible to receive dasatinib 140 mg daily if they had a poor initial molecular response (n=18) or a molecular recurrence (n=8). The tolerance of dasatinib as maintenance therapy was satisfactory. The 2-year disease-free survival in this high-risk population of patients was 25.7%. All but one patient with molecular recurrence presented subsequent hematologic relapse. Patients with slow initial molecular response had a similar disease-free survival when treated with dasatinib (40.2% at 2 years) or without any maintenance (50.0% at 2 years). The disappearance of KIT gene mutations at relapse suggests that clonal devolution may in part explain the absence of efficacy observed with single-agent dasatinib in these patients (n.

Recently, it has been proposed that BCL2 and BCL2L1/BCL-XL may inhibit autophagy indirectly through a mechanism dependent on the proapoptotic BCL2 family members, BAX and BAK1. Here we report that the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, induces autophagy in parallel with disruption of BCL2-BECN1 binding in 2 different apoptosis-deficient cell types lacking BAX and BAK1, namely in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells and in human colon cancer HCT116 cells.

We previously demonstrated that this occurs alongside enhanced megakaryopoiesis in iron-deficient rats, without alterations in the megakaryopoietic growth factors thrombopoietin, interleukin-6, or interleukin-11. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate megakaryocyte differentiation under iron deficiency in an in vitro model and to investigate potential genes involved in this process. METHODS: Human erythroleukemia and megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines, as well as cord-blood derived hematopoietic stem cells were cultured under iron deficiency. Cell morphology, ploidy, expression of CD41, CD61, and CD42b, and proplatelet formation were assessed in iron-deficient cultures. Polymerase chain reaction arrays were used to identify candidate genes that were verified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF2alpha) protein expression was assessed in bone marrow sections from iron-deficient rats and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in culture supernatants. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency enhanced megakaryoid features in cell lines, increasing ploidy and initiating formation of proplatelet-like structures. In cord blood cell cultures, iron deficiency increased the percentage of cells expressing megakaryopoietic markers and enhanced proplatelet formation. HIF2alpha and VEGF were identified as potential pathways involved in this process. HIF2alpha protein expression was increased in megakaryocytes from iron-deficient rats, and VEGF-A concentration was higher in iron-deficient culture supernatants. Addition of VEGF-A to cell cultures increased percentage expression of megakaryocyte CD41. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that iron deficiency augments megakaryocytic differentiation and proplatelet formation and a potential role of HIF2alpha in megakaryopoiesis.","['Jimenez, K', 'Khare, V', 'Evstatiev, R', 'Kulnigg-Dabsch, S', 'Jambrich, M', 'Strobl, H', 'Gasche, C']","['Jimenez K', 'Khare V', 'Evstatiev R', 'Kulnigg-Dabsch S', 'Jambrich M', 'Strobl H', 'Gasche C']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Molecular Cancer Chemoprevention, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Molecular Cancer Chemoprevention, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Molecular Cancer Chemoprevention, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center of Pathophysiology, Infectiology, and Immunology, Institute of Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Pathophysiology and Immunology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Molecular Cancer Chemoprevention, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150423,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)']",IM,"['Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Ploidies', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombocytosis/*blood/genetics/pathology', '*Thrombopoiesis', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",PMC4949661,2015/02/26 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jth.12884 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2015 Jun;13(6):1113-27. doi: 10.1111/jth.12884.

To address this critical issue, we developed a novel autophagy assay using the newly developed Cyto-ID fluorescence dye. We first verified that the Cyto-ID dye specifically labels autophagic compartments with minimal staining of lysosomes and endosomes. We then developed a new Cyto-ID fluorescence spectrophotometric assay that makes it possible to estimate autophagy flux based on measurements of the Cyto-ID-stained autophagic compartments. By comparing to traditional autophagy approaches, we found that this assay yielded a more sensitive, yet less variable, quantification of the stained autophagic compartments and the estimate of autophagy flux. Furthermore, we tested the potential application of this autophagy assay in high throughput research by integrating it into an RNA interference (RNAi) screen and a small molecule screen. The RNAi screen revealed WNK2 and MAP3K6 as autophagy-modulating genes, both of which inhibited the MTOR pathway. Similarly, the small molecule screen identified sanguinarine and actinomycin D as potent autophagy inducers in leukemic cells. Moreover, we successfully detected autophagy responses to kinase inhibitors and chloroquine in normal or leukemic mice using this assay. Collectively, this new Cyto-ID fluorescence spectrophotometric assay provides a rapid, reliable quantification of autophagic compartments and estimation of autophagy flux with potential applications in developing autophagy-related therapies and as a test to monitor autophagy responses in patients being treated with autophagy-modulating drugs.","['Guo, Sujuan', 'Liang, Yanping', 'Murphy, Susan F', 'Huang, Angela', 'Shen, Haihong', 'Kelly, Deborah F', 'Sobrado, Pablo', 'Sheng, Zhi']","['Guo S', 'Liang Y', 'Murphy SF', 'Huang A', 'Shen H', 'Kelly DF', 'Sobrado P', 'Sheng Z']","['a Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute ; Roanoke , VA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (WNK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Survival', 'Chloroquine/chemistry', 'Dactinomycin/chemistry', 'Endosomes/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/chemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/chemistry', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/*methods']",PMC4502761,2015/02/26 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15548627.2015.1017181 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2015;11(3):560-72. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2015.1017181.,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-MA, 3-methyladenine', 'Cyto-ID', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'GFP, green fluorescent protein', 'LAMP1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1', 'MAP1LC3B/LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta', 'MAP3K6, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 6', 'MDC, monodansylcadaverine', 'MTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin', 'NS, nonsilencing', 'RAB5A, member RAS oncogene family', 'RNA interference screen', 'RNAi, RNA interference', 'SQSTM1, sequestosome 1', 'WNK2, WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2', 'autophagy', 'autophagy flux', 'autophagy response', 'mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein', 'shRNA, short-hairpin RNA', 'small molecule screen', 'spectrophotometric assay']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chabamide, a dimeric alkaloid isolated from Piper chaba Hunter, shows antimalarial, antituberculosis, and cytotoxic activities. However, its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. In this study, the molecular mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity and downregulation of P-gp expression by chabamide in adriamycin-resistant human leukemia cells (K562/ADR) was clarified. Results show that chabamide inhibited the growth of K562/ADR cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which was associated with an obvious increase in p21 and decrease in cyclin D1 and CDK2/4/6 protein expression. Moreover, chabamide could regulate the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, increase the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as Bax and cytochrome c, and decrease the protein expression levels of Bcl-2, caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP-1, and p-Akt. In addition, we found that JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 were regulated by chabamide in K562/ADR cells. Further studies indicated that the decrease in the reactive oxygen species level inhibited intrinsic P-gp expression. Therefore, chabamide-induced apoptosis in K562/ADR cells was associated with Akt/MAPK and the inhibition of P-gp. These results provide a biochemical basis for possible clinical applications of chabamide in the treatment of leukemia.","['Ren, Jie', 'Xu, Yuanyuan', 'Huang, Qianhui', 'Yang, Jie', 'Yang, Meng', 'Hu, Kun', 'Wei, Kun']","['Ren J', 'Xu Y', 'Huang Q', 'Yang J', 'Yang M', 'Hu K', 'Wei K']","[""aDepartment of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Life Science, Changzhou University, Jiangsu bKey Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (chabamide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction']",,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000209 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2015 Jun;26(5):498-507. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis blocking activity of Mcl-1 is inhibited by BH3-only protein Noxa. We found that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and its derivative X-11 are potent apoptosis inducers in AML cells and act through a Noxa-mediate pathway; X-11 is four-fold more active than DHA. DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis is associated with induction of Noxa; apoptosis is blocked by silencing Noxa. DHA and X-11 induce Noxa expression by upregulating the transcription factor FOXO3a in a reactive oxygen species-mediated pathway. Interfering with the integrity of the endoperoxide moiety of DHA and X-11, as well as chelating intracellular iron with deferoxamine, diminish apoptosis and Noxa induction. AML cells expressing Bcl-xL, or with overexpression of Bcl-2, have decreased sensitivity to DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis which could be overcome by addition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737. DHA and X-11 represent a new group of AML cells-apoptosis inducing compounds which work through Noxa up-regulation utilizing the specific endoperoxide moiety and intracellular iron.","['Zhao, Xuan', 'Zhong, Hang', 'Wang, Rui', 'Liu, Dan', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Zhao, Linxiang', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Zhao X', 'Zhong H', 'Wang R', 'Liu D', 'Waxman S', 'Zhao L', 'Jing Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Chemical Synthesis, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Synthesis, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Synthesis, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '6A9O50735X (artenimol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Artemisinins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Peroxides/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",PMC4467388,2015/02/26 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['3336 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3336 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 20;6(8):5582-96. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3336.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'dihydroartemisinin', 'noxa']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined the impact of age on the prognostic significance of NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative status in older patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with AML age >/= 55 years treated with intensive chemotherapy as part of Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) and UK National Cancer Research Institute/Medical Research Council (NCRI/MRC) trials were evaluated. A comprehensive analysis first examined 156 patients treated in SWOG trials. Validation analyses then examined 1,258 patients treated in MRC/NCRI trials. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine the impact of age on the prognostic significance of NPM1 mutations, FLT3-ITDs, and the NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative genotype. RESULTS: Patients with AML age 55 to 65 years with NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative genotype treated in SWOG trials had a significantly improved 2-year overall survival (OS) as compared with those without this genotype (70% v 32%; P < .001). Moreover, patients age 55 to 65 years with NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative genotype had a significantly improved 2-year OS as compared with those age > 65 years with this genotype (70% v 27%; P < .001); any potential survival benefit of this genotype in patients age > 65 years was marginal (27% v 16%; P = .33). In multivariable analysis, NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative genotype remained independently associated with an improved OS in patients age 55 to 65 years (P = .002) but not in those age > 65 years (P = .82). These results were confirmed in validation analyses examining the NCRI/MRC patients. CONCLUSION: NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative genotype remains a relatively favorable prognostic factor for patients with AML age 55 to 65 years but not in those age > 65 years.","['Ostronoff, Fabiana', 'Othus, Megan', 'Lazenby, Michelle', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Evans, Anna', 'Godwin, John', 'Gilkes, Amanda', 'Kopecky, Kenneth J', 'Burnett, Alan', 'List, Alan F', 'Fang, Min', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Petersdorf, Stephen H', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan, Era L', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Stirewalt, Derek L']","['Ostronoff F', 'Othus M', 'Lazenby M', 'Estey E', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Evans A', 'Godwin J', 'Gilkes A', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Burnett A', 'List AF', 'Fang M', 'Oehler VG', 'Petersdorf SH', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan EL', 'Radich JP', 'Willman CL', 'Meshinchi S', 'Stirewalt DL']","['Fabiana Ostronoff, Megan Othus, Elihu Estey, Frederick R.

CLL might also pose diagnostic challenges by demonstrating an uncommon immunohistochemical profile. Recently, the role of lymphocyte enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) in CLL was elucidated being highly expressed and seeming to have a prognostic value. Our aim was to test the applicability of LEF1 as marker for CLL in a diagnostic setting. METHODS: We investigated LEF1 expression in lymphomas by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing several lymphoma entities (altogether 720 cases, including 61 CLL cases). We also separated CLL cases by zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) and CD38 stainings and fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses for TP53 deletions and trisomy 12 into respective groups and correlated data with LEF1 expression. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for LEF1 as a diagnostic marker for CLL was 0.815 (95% CI 0.742 to 0.888). The relevant diagnostic cut-off value for LEF1 positivity determined by the Youden's index was 10% (specificity 92%, sensitivity 70%). The majority of CLL cases (70%) expressed LEF1. Eighteen per cent of (transformed) diffuse large B cell lymphoma cases also expressed LEF1. In most other lymphoma entities, LEF1 was negative. There was a positive correlation of LEF1 staining with ZAP70 expression (Spearman's rho: 0.438, p<0.001), but not with CD38 expression, TP53 deletions or trisomy 12. CONCLUSIONS: LEF1 is a useful marker in the differential diagnosis of CLL in difficult cases. It shows a high specificity (92%) and a reasonable sensitivity (70%) for this entity.","['Menter, Thomas', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Tzankov, Alexandar']","['Menter T', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150224,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'ROC Curve', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['jclinpath-2015-202862 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2015-202862 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jun;68(6):473-8. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2015-202862.

Sequence analysis of the env genes of ALV-J demonstrated that both gp85 and gp37 were highly homologous among the three strains from local chickens of those among ALV-J strains isolated from white meat-type chickens. The phylogenetic trees indicated that the three strains isolated in this study were closely related to reference strains isolated in so-called Chinese yellow chickens and some strains isolated from white meat-type chickens, both from the USA and China.

Here, we report findings from analyzing 1,323 short RNA sequencing samples (RNA-seq) from 13 different human tissue types. Using stringent thresholding criteria, we identified 3,707 statistically significant novel mature miRNAs at a false discovery rate of </= 0.05 arising from 3,494 novel precursors; 91.5% of these novel miRNAs were identified independently in 10 or more of the processed samples. Analysis of these novel miRNAs revealed tissue-specific dependencies and a commensurate low Jaccard similarity index in intertissue comparisons. Of these novel miRNAs, 1,657 (45%) were identified in 43 datasets that were generated by cross-linking followed by Argonaute immunoprecipitation and sequencing (Ago CLIP-seq) and represented 3 of the 13 tissues, indicating that these miRNAs are active in the RNA interference pathway. Moreover, experimental investigation through stem-loop PCR of a random collection of newly discovered miRNAs in 12 cell lines representing 5 tissues confirmed their presence and tissue dependence. Among the newly identified miRNAs are many novel miRNA clusters, new members of known miRNA clusters, previously unreported products from uncharacterized arms of miRNA precursors, and previously unrecognized paralogues of functionally important miRNA families (e.g., miR-15/107). Examination of the sequence conservation across vertebrate and invertebrate organisms showed 56.7% of the newly discovered miRNAs to be human-specific whereas the majority (94.4%) are primate lineage-specific. Our findings suggest that the repertoire of human miRNAs is far more extensive than currently represented by public repositories and that there is a significant number of lineage- and/or tissue-specific miRNAs that are uncharacterized.","['Londin, Eric', 'Loher, Phillipe', 'Telonis, Aristeidis G', 'Quann, Kevin', 'Clark, Peter', 'Jing, Yi', 'Hatzimichael, Eleftheria', 'Kirino, Yohei', 'Honda, Shozo', 'Lally, Michelle', 'Ramratnam, Bharat', 'Comstock, Clay E S', 'Knudsen, Karen E', 'Gomella, Leonard', 'Spaeth, George L', 'Hark, Lisa', 'Katz, L Jay', 'Witkiewicz, Agnieszka', 'Rostami, Abdolmohamad', 'Jimenez, Sergio A', 'Hollingsworth, Michael A', 'Yeh, Jen Jen', 'Shaw, Chad A', 'McKenzie, Steven E', 'Bray, Paul', 'Nelson, Peter T', 'Zupo, Simona', 'Van Roosbroeck, Katrien', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Calin, George A', 'Yeo, Charles', 'Jimbo, Masaya', 'Cozzitorto, Joseph', 'Brody, Jonathan R', 'Delgrosso, Kathleen', 'Mattick, John S', 'Fortina, Paolo', 'Rigoutsos, Isidore']","['Londin E', 'Loher P', 'Telonis AG', 'Quann K', 'Clark P', 'Jing Y', 'Hatzimichael E', 'Kirino Y', 'Honda S', 'Lally M', 'Ramratnam B', 'Comstock CE', 'Knudsen KE', 'Gomella L', 'Spaeth GL', 'Hark L', 'Katz LJ', 'Witkiewicz A', 'Rostami A', 'Jimenez SA', 'Hollingsworth MA', 'Yeh JJ', 'Shaw CA', 'McKenzie SE', 'Bray P', 'Nelson PT', 'Zupo S', 'Van Roosbroeck K', 'Keating MJ', 'Calin GA', 'Yeo C', 'Jimbo M', 'Cozzitorto J', 'Brody JR', 'Delgrosso K', 'Mattick JS', 'Fortina P', 'Rigoutsos I']","['Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107;

These tumors are genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96% of FL tumors and two or more in 76% of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased antigen presentation.","['Green, Michael R', 'Kihira, Shingo', 'Liu, Chih Long', 'Nair, Ramesh V', 'Salari, Raheleh', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Irish, Jonathan', 'Stehr, Henning', 'Vicente-Duenas, Carolina', 'Romero-Camarero, Isabel', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Plevritis, Sylvia K', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Batzoglou, Serafim', 'Levy, Ronald', 'Alizadeh, Ash A']","['Green MR', 'Kihira S', 'Liu CL', 'Nair RV', 'Salari R', 'Gentles AJ', 'Irish J', 'Stehr H', 'Vicente-Duenas C', 'Romero-Camarero I', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Plevritis SK', 'Arber DA', 'Batzoglou S', 'Levy R', 'Alizadeh AA']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, arasha@stanford.edu michael.green@unmc.edu.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Division of Oncology, Division of Radiology.', 'Department of Computer Science, and.', 'Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Division of Radiology.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305;', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain; and.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain; and.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain; and.', 'Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Division of Radiology.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Computer Science, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305;', 'Division of Oncology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; arasha@stanford.edu michael.green@unmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'CREB-Binding Protein/genetics', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/immunology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC4364211,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1501199112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1501199112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Mar 10;112(10):E1116-25. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1501199112.

EKLF serves mostly as an activator of expression of these genes; however, it can act also as a repressor. Here, we present evidence that EKLF interacts with proteins from the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family that convey repressive activity to EKLF in the absence of sumoylation. Our studies identify PIAS3 as a transcriptional corepressor of EKLF for at least a subset of its target genes during erythropoiesis (e.g. beta-globin, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein). We demonstrate an interaction between EKLF and PIAS proteins confirmed by in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays with both exogenous and endogenous proteins. We identified an LXXLL signature motif located near the N terminus of PIAS proteins that, although not involved in the EKLF-PIAS3 interaction, is required for the transrepression activity. Knockdown of endogenous PIAS3 accelerates differentiation of both murine erythroleukemia cells, as well as fetal liver cells, whereas an increase in PIAS3 levels inhibits this increase. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that PIAS3 preferentially occupies the beta-globin promoter in undifferentiated murine erythroleukemia cells. Together these results demonstrate that an interaction between EKLF and PIAS3 provides a novel mode of regulation of EKLF activity in the absence of sumolylation and furthermore shows an important involvement of PIAS proteins in erythropoiesis.","['Siatecka, Miroslawa', 'Soni, Shefali', 'Planutis, Antanas', 'Bieker, James J']","['Siatecka M', 'Soni S', 'Planutis A', 'Bieker JJ']","['From the Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029 and the Department of Genetics, Institute of Experimental Biology, University of Adam Mickiewicz, 61-614 Poznan, Poland msiatecka@amu.edu.pl.', 'From the Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029 and.', 'From the Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029 and.', 'From the Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029 and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150224,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sumoylation', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4392289,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)44451-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.610246 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Apr 10;290(15):9929-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.610246.

However, resistance to TKI therapy arises rapidly, and its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel cascade of events initiated by TKIs and traversing through mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to leukemic cells, leading to resistance. MSCs exposed to TKIs acquired a new functional status with the expression of genes encoding for chemo-attractants, adhesion molecules, and prosurvival growth factors, and this priming enabled leukemic cells to form clusters underneath the MSCs. This cluster formation was associated with the protection of ALL cells from therapy as leukemic cells switched from BCR-ABL signaling to IL-7R/Janus kinase signaling to survive in the MSC milieu. Our findings illustrate a novel perspective in the evolution of TKI resistance and provide insights for advancing the treatment of BCR-ABL(+) ALL.","['Mallampati, Saradhi', 'Leng, Xiaohong', 'Ma, Haiqing', 'Zeng, Jianfang', 'Li, June', 'Wang, Haiying', 'Lin, Kevin', 'Lu, Yue', 'Yang, Yang', 'Sun, Baohua', 'Gong, Yun', 'Lee, Ju-Seog', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Fang, Bingliang', 'Shen, Haifa', 'Han, Xin', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, Cheryl F', 'Gao, Xiaolian', 'Paranjape, Anurag N', 'Mani, Sendurai A', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Sun, Xiaoping']","['Mallampati S', 'Leng X', 'Ma H', 'Zeng J', 'Li J', 'Wang H', 'Lin K', 'Lu Y', 'Yang Y', 'Sun B', 'Gong Y', 'Lee JS', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Cai Z', 'Fang B', 'Shen H', 'Han X', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg CF', 'Gao X', 'Paranjape AN', 'Mani SA', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Sun X']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and Department of Oncology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China;', 'Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center and Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of System Biology.', 'Department of Leukemia, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, and.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center and Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China;', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Nanomedicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4424418,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2014/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31718-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-576421 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 7;125(19):2968-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-576421.

Treatment modalities to increase this proportion are currently unknown. Here, we assessed the role of interferon alpha 2a (IFN) on therapy discontinuation in a previously reported cohort of 20 chronic phase CML patients who were treated upfront with IFN alpha plus imatinib followed by IFN monotherapy to maintain cytogenetic or molecular remission (MR) after imatinib discontinuation. After a median follow-up of 7.9 years (range, 5.2-12.2), relapse-free survival was 73% (8/11 patients) and 84% (5/6 patients) for patients who discontinued imatinib in major MR (MMR) and MR4/MR4.5, respectively. Ten patients discontinued IFN after a median of 4.5 years (range, 0.24-9.3). After a median of 2.8 years (range, 0.7-5.1), nine of them remain in ongoing treatment-free remission with MR5 (n=6) and MR4.5 (n=3). The four patients who still administer IFN are in stable MR5, MR4.5, MR4, and MMR, respectively. In conclusion, an IFN/imatinib induction treatment followed by a temporary IFN maintenance therapy may enable a high rate of treatment discontinuation in CML patients in at least MMR when stopping imatinib.","['Burchert, A', 'Saussele, S', 'Eigendorff, E', 'Muller, M C', 'Sohlbach, K', 'Inselmann, S', 'Schutz, C', 'Metzelder, S K', 'Ziermann, J', 'Kostrewa, P', 'Hoffmann, J', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Neubauer, A', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Burchert A', 'Saussele S', 'Eigendorff E', 'Muller MC', 'Sohlbach K', 'Inselmann S', 'Schutz C', 'Metzelder SK', 'Ziermann J', 'Kostrewa P', 'Hoffmann J', 'Hehlmann R', 'Neubauer A', 'Hochhaus A']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie/Onkologie und Immunologie, Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Standort Marburg, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'III.

The aim of this study is to check whether matrine, an alkaloid isolated from traditional Chinese herb Sophora flavescens ait, can exert cytotoxic effects against cholangiocarcinoma cells via inactivation of STAT3 signaling. METHODS: Mz-ChA-1 and KMCH-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with matrine at 0.25-2.0 g/L for 48 h and cell viability and apoptosis were assessed. Apoptosis-related molecular changes and STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activities were measured after matrine treatment for 48 h. The effect of expression of a constitutively active STAT3 mutant on matrine-induced apoptosis was determined. RESULTS: Matrine significantly inhibited the viability and induced apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Matrine treatment caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and -3. Matrine-induced apoptosis was inhibited in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. Matrine reduced the phosphorylation levels of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and STAT3, inhibited STAT3-dependent transcriptional activity, and downregulated STAT3 target gene Mcl-1. Notably, expression of the constitutively active form of STAT3 significantly antagonized matrine-induced apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells. CONCLUSION: Matrine can trigger mitochondrial apoptotic death of cholangiocarcinoma cells largely through inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Therefore, matrine represents a potentially effective anticancer agent for cholangiocarcinoma.","['Yang, Nanmu', 'Han, Feng', 'Cui, Hong', 'Huang, Jinxi', 'Wang, Tao', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Zhou, Jinxue']","['Yang N', 'Han F', 'Cui H', 'Huang J', 'Wang T', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.

The structures of the compounds were established by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and HR MS spectra. The esters were assayed for antiproliferative activity against human leukemia HL-60 and prostate cancer DU145 cell lines. The activity of novel esters was evaluated by cell viability assays as well as by analysis of cell cycle and cell death mechanism. RESULTS: The esters were found to be of similar or higher activity than gallic acid. No pronounced harmful effect was observed in non-cancer cells.

METHODS: The seafarers' cancer discharge diagnoses from hospital were compared with those discharge diagnoses from the German general population and expressed as a standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR). RESULTS: The examined seafarers (on average 23,436 per year) showed a higher SHR for malignant neoplasms at all sites, in decreasing order for leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), respiratory cancer, and non-melanoma skin cancer. Seafarers employed on tankers showed a considerably elevated SHR for malignant neoplasms at all sites, which was mainly attributable to their high SHR for leukemia and respiratory cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Seafaring occupations pose an elevated risk of certain cancers. Further studies are required to evaluate to what extent occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances and lifestyle-related unhealthy behaviours contribute to the increased risk of cancer in seafarers.","['Oldenburg, Marcus', 'Harth, Volker', 'Manuwald, Ulf']","['Oldenburg M', 'Harth V', 'Manuwald U']","['Institute for Occupational and Maritime Medicine, ZfAM, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150224,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naval Medicine', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations', 'Risk Assessment', 'Ships/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajim.22423 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2015 Apr;58(4):456-63. doi: 10.1002/ajim.22423.

This heterogeneity appears to be related to the type of patients included, the study design, and patient-related factors as well as the treatment used. The pathophysiology of thrombosis in AL is complex and multifactorial and includes a myriad of factors that contribute to cancer procoagulant state: synthesis of procoagulant factors by circulating blasts, cellular microparticles, use of endovascular devices (catheters), type of chemotherapy used (L-asparaginase) to name a few. Currently, treatment relies in the use of heparin, followed by vitamin K antagonists for 3 to 6 months.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the central treatment strategy for CML patients and have significantly improved survival rates, but the T315I mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 confers resistance to all clinically approved TKIs, except ponatinib. However, compound mutations can mediate resistance even to ponatinib and remain a clinical challenge in CML therapy. Here, we investigated a ponatinib-resistant CML patient through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the cause of resistance and to find alternative therapeutic targets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out WGS on a ponatinib-resistant CML patient and demonstrated an effective combination therapy against the primary CML cells derived from this patient in vitro. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate the emergence of compound mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain following ponatinib treatment, and chromosomal structural variation data predicted amplification of BCL2. The primary CD34(+) CML cells from this patient showed increased sensitivity to the combination of ponatinib and ABT-263, a BCL2 inhibitor with a negligible effect against the normal CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSION: Our results show the potential of personalised medicine approaches in TKI-resistant CML patients and provide a strategy that could improve clinical outcomes for these patients.","['Korfi, K', 'Mandal, A', 'Furney, S J', 'Wiseman, D', 'Somervaille, T C P', 'Marais, R']","['Korfi K', 'Mandal A', 'Furney SJ', 'Wiseman D', 'Somervaille TCP', 'Marais R']","['Molecular Oncology Group.', 'Molecular Oncology Group.', 'Molecular Oncology Group.', 'Leukaemia Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Molecular Oncology Group.

Upon transfer of human cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), CD3(-)CD56(high)CD16(+/-) cells developed unexpectedly, predominantly in the NOG-IL-2 Tg (hu-HSC NOG-IL-2 Tg). These cells expressed various NK receptors, including NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, and CD94, as well as a diverse set of killer cell Ig-like receptor molecules at levels comparable to normal human NK cells from the peripheral blood, which is evidence of their maturity. They produced levels of granzyme A as high as in human peripheral blood-derived NK cells, and a considerable amount of perforin protein was detected in the plasma. Human NK cells in hu-HSC NOG-IL-2 Tg produced IFN-gamma upon stimulation, and IL-2, IL-15, or IL-12 treatment augmented the in vitro cytotoxicity. Inoculation of K562 leukemia cells into hu-HSC NOG-IL-2 Tg caused complete rejection of the tumor cells, whereas inoculation into hu-HSC NOG fully reconstituted with human B, T, and some NK cells did not. Moreover, when a CCR4(+) Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line was inoculated s.c. into hu-HSC NOG-IL-2 Tg, the tumor growth was significantly suppressed by treatment with a therapeutic humanized anti-CCR4 Ab (mogamulizumab), suggesting that the human NK cells in the mice exerted active Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that the new NOG-IL-2 Tg strain is a unique model that can be used to investigate the biological and pathological functions of human NK cells in vivo.","['Katano, Ikumi', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Ito, Ryoji', 'Kamisako, Tsutomu', 'Mizusawa, Takuma', 'Ka, Yuyo', 'Ogura, Tomoyuki', 'Suemizu, Hiroshi', 'Kawakami, Yutaka', 'Ito, Mamoru']","['Katano I', 'Takahashi T', 'Ito R', 'Kamisako T', 'Mizusawa T', 'Ka Y', 'Ogura T', 'Suemizu H', 'Kawakami Y', 'Ito M']","['Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and Division of Cellular Signaling, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and takeshi-takahashi@ciea.or.jp.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, KIR/genetics/metabolism']",,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401323 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401323 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Apr 1;194(7):3513-25. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401323.

We planned a search for causative gene variants in seven subjects with intellectual disability and overlapping dysmorphic facial features such as bulbous nasal tip, short mouth and straight eyebrows. We found two de novo frameshift variants in MED13L, consisting in single-nucleotide deletion (c.3765delC) and duplication (c.607dupT). A de novo nonsense variant (c.4420A>T) in MED13L was detected in a further subject in the course of routine whole-exome sequencing. By analyzing the clinical data of our patients along with those recently described in the literature, we confirm that there is a common, recognizable phenotype associated with MED13L haploinsufficiency, which includes intellectual disability and a distinctive facial appearance. Congenital heart diseases are found in some subjects with various degree of severity. Our observation of cleft palate, ataxia, epilepsy and childhood leukemia observed in single cases broadens the known clinical spectrum. Haploinsufficiency for MED13L should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome, due to overlapping dysmorphic facial features in some patients. The introduction of massive parallel-sequencing techniques into clinical practice is expected to allow for detection of other causative point variants in MED13L.

Initially identified as proto-oncogenes because they promote the development of certain types of leukemia, inactivating mutations of NOTCH were later reported. Together with the potential distinct functions of NOTCH family members, their ligands and associated niches, the precise roles of NOTCH in human cancers, particularly solid tumors, remain unsettled. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), mutations of NOTCH1 are found in 10% to 15% tumors from Caucasian patients, mostly inactivating mutations. Recent studies of OSCC from Chinese patients, however, showed mutation rates of NOTCH1 about 50% with a considerable portion of potential activating mutations. These findings add another twist into the already complex picture of NOTCH alterations in human cancers, calling for further investigation to uncover what role exactly these molecules play in cancer initiation and progression to develop strategies targeting NOTCH signaling for cancer prevention and treatment.","['Mao, Li']",['Mao L'],"['Department of Oncology and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Maryland School of Dentistry, Baltimore, Maryland. lmao@umaryland.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20150224,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,"['0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukoplakia, Oral/*pathology', 'Mouth Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",,2015/02/26 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-15-0063 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-15-0063 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2015 Apr;8(4):259-61. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-15-0063.

This pathway can function as a prosurvival factor in leukemia stem cells and early committed leukemic precursors and its inhibition is regarded as a therapeutic approach. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to evaluate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors used in leukemia models. DISCUSSION: Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been reported to have beneficial therapeutic effects in leukemias, both in vitro in leukemia cell lines and in vivo in animal models. Overall, the use of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, dual Akt/RTK inhibitor, Akt inhibitor, selective inhibitor of PI3K, mTOR inhibitor and dual PI3K/PDK1 inhibitor in CML, AML, APL, CLL, B-ALL and T-ALL has a better therapeutic effect than conventional treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may have pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effects on hematological malignancies. Furthermore, modulation of miRNA can be used as a novel therapeutic approach to regulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. However, both aspects require further clinical studies.","['Bertacchini, Jessika', 'Heidari, Nazanin', 'Mediani, Laura', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Shahjahani, Mohammad', 'Ahmadzadeh, Ahmad', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Bertacchini J', 'Heidari N', 'Mediani L', 'Capitani S', 'Shahjahani M', 'Ahmadzadeh A', 'Saki N']","['Department of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150225,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2015/02/26 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-015-1867-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2015 Jun;72(12):2337-47. doi: 10.1007/s00018-015-1867-5.

The aim of this study was to examine chief reasons for ED and hospital use by patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia patients after induction therapy up to one year after discharge. A retrospective, longitudinal study of all visits to the ED or unplanned hospital admissions at a single institution for patients with acute leukemia was conducted. Inclusion criteria were patients >/=18 years of age at time of diagnosis, a confirmed diagnosis of AML or ALL, and received and discharged from induction treatment between 2007 and 2010. Donabedian's structure-process-outcome framework guided this study examining health services utilization and assessing patient outcomes. 80 patients met the inclusion criteria; 52 had AML and 28 had ALL; median age was 48 (range: 18-76) and 29% (n=23) were non-Caucasian. 70% (n=56) were discharged from induction in remission. 81% (n=65) had at least 1 ED or hospitalization event, and 44% (n=35) had 2 or more events. Of 137 events in 65 patients, the most common reason was neutropenic fever/infection (55%), bleeding (12%), and GI problems (11%). Mean number of events for ALL was 2.43 compared to 1.33 for AML patients (p=0.02), and 2.23 for <50 years of age compared to 1.20 for those older (p=0.002). 20 patients died within one year of diagnosis. Findings from this study can help inform health services delivery and utilization among patients with acute leukemia after induction therapy. Oncology providers can anticipate discharge needs and enhance follow-up care for those at higher risk for problems needing hospitalization.","['Bryant, Ashley Leak', 'Deal, Allison M', 'Walton, AnnMarie', 'Wood, William A', 'Muss, Hyman', 'Mayer, Deborah K']","['Bryant AL', 'Deal AM', 'Walton A', 'Wood WA', 'Muss H', 'Mayer DK']","['School of Nursing, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.

It regulates self-renewal (Butler et al. in Cell Stem Cell 6:251-264, 2010), differentiation (Auderset et al. in Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 360:115-134, 2012), proliferation (VanDussen et al. in Development 139:488-497, 2012) and apoptosis (Cao et al. in APMIS 120:441-450, 2012) of diverse cell types at various stages of their development. NOTCH signalling governs cell-cell interactions and the outcome of such responses is highly context specific. This makes it impossible to generalize about NOTCH functions as it stimulates survival and differentiation of certain cell types, whereas inhibiting these processes in others (Meier-Stiegen et al. in PLoS One 5:e11481, 2010). NOTCH was first identified in 1914 in Drosophila and was named after the indentations (notches) present in the wings of the mutant flies (Bigas et al. in Int J Dev Biol 54:1175-1188, 2010). Homologs of NOTCH in vertebrates were initially identified in Xenopus (Coffman et al. in Science 249:1438-1441, 1990) and in humans NOTCH was first identified in T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (T-ALL) (Ellisen et al. in Cell 66:649-61, 1991). NOTCH signalling is integral in neurogenesis (Mead and Yutzey in Dev Dyn 241:376-389, 2012), myogenesis (Schuster-Gossler et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104:537-542, 2007), haematopoiesis (Bigas et al. in Int J Dev Biol 54:1175-1188, 2010), oogenesis (Xu and Gridley in Genet Res Int 2012:648207, 2012), differentiation of intestinal cells (Okamoto et al. in Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 296:G23-35, 2009) and pancreatic cells (Apelqvist et al. in Nature 400:877-881, 1999).

In this study, we identify the dependence of AML blasts on arginine for proliferation. We show that AML blasts constitutively express the arginine transporters CAT-1 and CAT-2B, and that the majority of newly diagnosed patients' blasts have deficiencies in the arginine-recycling pathway enzymes argininosuccinate synthase and ornithine transcarbamylase, making them arginine auxotrophic. BCT-100, a pegylated human recombinant arginase, leads to a rapid depletion in extracellular and intracellular arginine concentrations, resulting in arrest of AML blast proliferation and a reduction in AML engraftment in vivo. BCT-100 as a single agent causes significant death of AML blasts from adults and children, and acts synergistically in combination with cytarabine. Using RNA sequencing, 20 further candidate genes which correlated with resistance have been identified.

OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic germline variants associated with the occurrence or severity of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in children with ALL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Genome-wide association study of patients in 1 of 2 prospective clinical trials for childhood ALL that included treatment with 36 to 39 doses of vincristine. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy were assessed in 321 patients from whom DNA was available: 222 patients (median age, 6.0 years; range, 0.1-18.8 years) enrolled in 1994-1998 in the St Jude Children's Research Hospital protocol Total XIIIB with toxic effects follow-up through January 2001, and 99 patients (median age, 11.4 years; range, 3.0-23.8 years) enrolled in 2007-2010 in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol AALL0433 with toxic effects follow-up through May 2011. Human leukemia cells and induced pluripotent stem cell neurons were used to assess the effects of lower CEP72 expression on vincristine sensitivity. EXPOSURE: Treatment with vincristine at a dose of 1.5 or 2.0 mg/m2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy was assessed at clinic visits using National Cancer Institute criteria and prospectively graded as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), serious/disabling (grade 3), or life threatening (grade 4). RESULTS: Grade 2 to 4 vincristine-induced neuropathy during continuation therapy occurred in 28.8% of patients (64/222) in the St Jude cohort and in 22.2% (22/99) in the COG cohort. A SNP in the promoter region of the CEP72 gene, which encodes a centrosomal protein involved in microtubule formation, had a significant association with vincristine neuropathy (meta-analysis P = 6.3x10(-9)). This SNP had a minor allele frequency of 37% (235/642), with 50 of 321 patients (16%; 95% CI, 11.6%-19.5%) homozygous for the risk allele (TT at rs924607). Among patients with the high-risk CEP72 genotype (TT at rs924607), 28 of 50 (56%; 95% CI, 41.2%-70.0%) developed at least 1 episode of grade 2 to 4 neuropathy, a higher rate than in patients with the CEP72 CC or CT genotypes (58/271 patients [21.4%; 95% CI, 16.9%-26.7%]; P = 2.4x10(-6)). The severity of neuropathy was greater in patients homozygous for the TT genotype compared with patients with the CC or CT genotype (2.4-fold by Poisson regression [P<.0001] and 2.7-fold based on mean grade of neuropathy: 1.23 [95% CI, 0.74-1.72] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.3-0.6]; P = .004 by t test). Reducing CEP72 expression in human neurons and leukemia cells increased their sensitivity to vincristine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary study of children with ALL, an inherited polymorphism in the promoter region of CEP72 was associated with increased risk and severity of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy. If replicated in additional populations, this finding may provide a basis for safer dosing of this widely prescribed anticancer agent.","['Diouf, Barthelemy', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Lew, Glen', 'Pei,

On the basis of CC and FISH results, we subdivided the series into group A (36 cases with a normal karyotype after CC and/or FISH testing) and group B (24 cases with anomalies detected by CC and/or FISH). oaCGH did not show alterations in 21 cases of the group A (58.3%); in the remaining 15 cases (41.7%), it detected 19 new abnormalities (14 amplifications and 5 deletions). In the group B, oaCGH confirmed 32/55 aneuploidies detected by FISH (58.1%). The sensitivity increased at 27/33 confirmed aneuploidies (81.8%) by placing as a cutoff a mosaic of 50%. Moreover, in the cases of this group oaCGH revealed 36 new alterations (15 amplifications and 21 deletions). From these results it is possible to assess a strong overlap between results obtained by FISH and oaCGH. However, oaCGH is a reliable alternative where CC and FISH are not feasible and is able to identify new alterations unexplored by FISH.","['Spina, Paolo', 'Coro, Ilaria', 'De Donno, Alessia', 'Vidali, Matteo', 'Morani, Federica', 'Cavaliere, Cristina', 'Galetto, Alessandra S', 'Kerim, Simonetta', 'Valente, Guido']","['Spina P', 'Coro I', 'De Donno A', 'Vidali M', 'Morani F', 'Cavaliere C', 'Galetto AS', 'Kerim S', 'Valente G']","['*Pathology Unit, Department of Translational Medicine double daggerDepartment of Medical Sciences section signOncology Unit, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University, Novara daggerCytogenetics Unit, San Giovanni Battista Hospital, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/*methods', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2016/11/12 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000159 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2016 Feb;24(2):120-7. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MIR223 is expressed at low levels in progenitor cells, whereas high expression is induced by granulocytic differentiation. Novel-targeted therapies through epigenetic manipulation of MIR223 regulators are being explored in AML but correlative data between established clinical prognostic markers and MIR223 expression in AML is lacking. MIR223 has inverse relationship with LMO2 protein expression and our group has recently reported a close association between LMO2 protein expression and chromosomal findings in AML patients. In this study, we examined the expression of MIR223 in a large cohort of AML patients and correlated it with LMO2 protein expression, cytogenetic data, degree of differentiation [French-American and British (FAB)/World Health Organization classifications], and overall survival. MIR223 expression was upregulated in only a subset of patients (37%). Suppression of MIR223 was more frequent among patients with aneuploid karyotype compared with diploid karyotype (P=0.005). In AML, not otherwise specified category, AML with maturation (FAB-M2) showed higher levels of MIR223 when compared with either AML without maturation (FAB M0/M1) (P=0.001); AML with monoblastic differentiation (FAB M4/M5) (P=0.004) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P=0.011). Among cytogenetic risk groups, suppression of MIR223 was universal (>95%) in high-risk group when compared with intermediate-risk group (P=0.004). No correlation between MIR223 and LMO2 protein expression was identified. In conclusion, we have shown that suppression of MIR223 expression, as compared with controls, is associated with lack of differentiation and adverse cytogenetic profile, but unrelated with LMO2 protein expression or overall survival.","['Akhter, Ariz', 'Patel, Jay L', 'Farooq, Fahad', 'Qureshi, Abid', 'Taher-Rad, Meer-Shahbani', 'Elyamany, Ghaleb', 'Al-Zahrani, Ali M', 'Rashid-Kolvear, Fariborz', 'Mansoor, Adnan']","['Akhter A', 'Patel JL', 'Farooq F', 'Qureshi A', 'Taher-Rad MS', 'Elyamany G', 'Al-Zahrani AM', 'Rashid-Kolvear F', 'Mansoor A']","['*Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematology & TM double daggerCalgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Division of Anatomic Pathology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada daggerDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (GE) and Oncology (AMA), Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*LIM Domain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', '*MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2016/08/31 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000145 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2015 Nov-Dec;23(10):733-9. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the ability of NK cells to lyse the malignant cells and to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity upon Fc receptor stimulation is compromised, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. We report here that NK-cells activation-dependently produce the tumor necrosis factor family member 'B-cell activating factor' (BAFF) in soluble form with no detectable surface expression, also in response to Fc receptor triggering by therapeutic CD20-antibodies. BAFF in turn enhanced the metabolic activity of primary CLL cells and impaired direct and Rituximab-induced lysis of CLL cells without affecting NK reactivity per se. The neutralizing BAFF antibody Belimumab, which is approved for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, prevented the effects of BAFF on the metabolism of CLL cells and restored their susceptibility to direct and Rituximab-induced NK-cell killing in allogeneic and autologous experimental systems. Our findings unravel the involvement of BAFF in the resistance of CLL cells to NK-cell antitumor immunity and Rituximab treatment and point to a benefit of combinatory approaches employing BAFF-neutralizing drugs in B-cell malignancies.","['Wild, J', 'Schmiedel, B J', 'Maurer, A', 'Raab, S', 'Prokop, L', 'Stevanovic, S', 'Dorfel, D', 'Schneider, P', 'Salih, H R']","['Wild J', 'Schmiedel BJ', 'Maurer A', 'Raab S', 'Prokop L', 'Stevanovic S', 'Dorfel D', 'Schneider P', 'Salih HR']","['1] Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany [2] Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', '1] Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany [2] Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', '1] Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany [2] Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.', '1] Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany [2] Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150224,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '73B0K5S26A (belimumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201550 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1676-83. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.50.

Nutritional status, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, phagocytic capacity and superoxide anion production of mononuclear cells, lipid peroxidation and catalase activity in plasma were evaluated in 16 untreated subjects. Main diagnosis was acute leukemia (n = 9) and median body mass index (BMI) indicated overweight (25.6 kg/m(2)). Median albumin was below (3.2 g/dL) and CRP above (37.45 mg/L) the reference values. Albumin was inversely correlated with BMI (r = -0.53). Most patients were overweight before the beginning of treatment and had a high CRP/albumin ratio, which may indicate a nutrition inflammatory risk. BMI values correlated positively with lipid peroxidation and catalase activity. A strong correlation between catalase activity and lipid peroxidation was found (r = 0.75). Besides the elevated BMI, these patients also have elevated CRP values and unexpected relations between nutritional status and albumin, reinforcing the need for nutritional counseling during the course of chemotherapy, especially considering the correlations between oxidative stress parameters and nutritional status evidenced here.","['Camargo, Carolina de Quadros', 'Borges, Dayanne da Silva', 'de Oliveira, Paula Fernanda', 'Chagas, Thayz Rodrigues', 'Del Moral, Joanita Angela Gonzaga', 'Durigon, Giovanna Steffanello', 'Dias, Bruno Vieira', 'Vieira, Andre Guedes', 'Gaspareto, Patrick', 'Trindade, Erasmo Benicio Santos de Moraes', 'Nunes, Everson Araujo']","['Camargo Cde Q', 'Borges Dda S', 'de Oliveira PF', 'Chagas TR', 'Del Moral JA', 'Durigon GS', 'Dias BV', 'Vieira AG', 'Gaspareto P', 'Trindade EB', 'Nunes EA']","['a Postgraduate Program in Nutrition , Federal University of Santa Catarina , Florianopolis , Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150224,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Body Mass Index', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nutritional Status', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Serum Albumin/analysis']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/12/25 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.1004732 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(3):463-71. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.1004732.

Due to being time-consuming and tediousness of the procedure, a computer-based system is acquired for convenient detection of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Microscopic images are acquired from blood and bone marrow smears of patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and normal cases. After applying image preprocessing, cells nuclei are segmented by k-means algorithm. Then geometric and statistical features are extracted from nuclei and finally these cells are classified to cancerous and noncancerous cells by means of support vector machine classifier with 10-fold cross validation. These cells are also classified into their sub-types by multi-Support vector machine classifier. Classifier is evaluated by these parameters: Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy which values for cancerous and noncancerous cells 98%, 95%, and 97%, respectively. These parameters are also used for evaluation of cell sub-types which values in mean 84.3%, 97.3%, and 95.6%, respectively.

Mutational and immunological monitoring may provide diagnostic and therapeutic significance in LGL leukemia.","['Yan, Yiyi', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Nyland, Susan B', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Yan Y', 'Olson TL', 'Nyland SB', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, York Hospital, York, PA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, P.O.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out by the Departments of Pharmacology and Medical Oncology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India. The study was carried out from March 2012 to February 2014. The ADRs were reported in a suspected Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting form, provided by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The ADRs were analyzed for their pattern, causality and severity. RESULTS: A total of 326 ADRs from 81 patients were reported during the study period. The hematological toxicities were much more prominent than the non-hematological toxicities in this study. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia (21.17%) was higher compared with other reactions. Further analysis showed that most of the ADRs were mild to moderate in nature. The causality assessment revealed that the majority of the ADRs belonged to the possible category. CONCLUSION: The present study in a tertiary care hospital suggests that hematological toxicities are predominant in CML patients treated with imatinib mesylate. The blood and lymphatic system (38.96%) was the most affected, with imatinib therapy and thrombocytopenia (21.17%) being the most commonly encountered ADRs in the present study. Thorough monitoring of ADRs is warranted for better treatment outcomes.","['Francis, Jose', 'Palaniappan, Muthiah', 'Dubashi, Biswajit', 'Pradhan, Suresh Chandra', 'Chandrasekaran, Adithan']","['Francis J', 'Palaniappan M', 'Dubashi B', 'Pradhan SC', 'Chandrasekaran A']","['Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Pharmacol Pharmacother,Journal of pharmacology & pharmacotherapeutics,101552113,,,,PMC4319245,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/02/25 06:01,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0976-500X.149141 [doi]', 'JPP-6-30 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Pharmacother. 2015 Jan-Mar;6(1):30-3. doi: 10.4103/0976-500X.149141.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse drug reactions', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'hematological toxicities', 'imatinib mesylate', 'thrombocytopenia']",,,,,,,['J Pharmacol Pharmacother. 2015 Apr-Jun;6(2):122.

Pinatuzumab vedotin is an anti-CD22 ADC and polatuzumab vedotin an anti-CD79B ADC that are both linked to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In the present study, we analyzed the activity of these agents in different molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) both in vitro and in early clinical trials. Both anti-CD22-MMAE and anti-CD79B-MMAE were highly active and induced cell death in the vast majority of activated B-cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL cell lines. Similarly, both agents induced cytotoxicity in models with and without mutations in the signaling molecule CD79B. In line with these observations, relapsed and refractory DLBCL patients of both subtypes responded to these agents. Importantly, a strong correlation between CD22 and CD79B expression in vitro and in vivo was not detectable, indicating that patients should not be excluded from anti-CD22-MMAE or anti-CD79B-MMAE treatment because of low target expression. In summary, these studies suggest that pinatuzumab vedotin and polatuzumab vedotin are active agents for the treatment of patients with different subtypes of DLBCL.","['Pfeifer, M', 'Zheng, B', 'Erdmann, T', 'Koeppen, H', 'McCord, R', 'Grau, M', 'Staiger, A', 'Chai, A', 'Sandmann, T', 'Madle, H', 'Dorken, B', 'Chu, Y-W', 'Chen, A I', 'Lebovic, D', 'Salles, G A', 'Czuczman, M S', 'Palanca-Wessels, M C', 'Press, O W', 'Advani, R', 'Morschhauser, F', 'Cheson, B D', 'Lenz, P', 'Ott, G', 'Polson, A G', 'Mundt, K E', 'Lenz, G']","['Pfeifer M', 'Zheng B', 'Erdmann T', 'Koeppen H', 'McCord R', 'Grau M', 'Staiger A', 'Chai A', 'Sandmann T', 'Madle H', 'Dorken B', 'Chu YW', 'Chen AI', 'Lebovic D', 'Salles GA', 'Czuczman MS', 'Palanca-Wessels MC', 'Press OW', 'Advani R', 'Morschhauser F', 'Cheson BD', 'Lenz P', 'Ott G', 'Polson AG', 'Mundt KE', 'Lenz G']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', '1] Division of Translational Oncology, Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany [2] Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion Munster, Germany.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus and Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', '1] Division of Translational Oncology, Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany [2] Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Hematology Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon - Universite de Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France.', 'Department of Medicine and Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Seattle Genetics Inc, Bothell, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington DC, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus and Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', '1] Division of Translational Oncology, Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany [2] Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150224,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD79 Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201548 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1578-86. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.48.

The leukemogenesis of the virus is mainly attributed to the viral oncoprotein. Tax activates the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) which stimulates the activity and expression of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a specific nutrient synergy (SNS) on proliferation, Tax expression, NF-kappaB levels as well as on MMP-9 activity and expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels in two HTLV-1 positive cell lines, HuT-102 and C91-PL at 48h and 96h of incubation. Cytotoxicity of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was assayed using CytoTox 96 Non-radioactive and proliferation was measured using Cell Titer96TM Nonradioactive Cell Proliferation kit (MTT- based assay). Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were used to assess the effect of SNS on NF-kappaB mobility. Zymography was used to determine the effects of SNS on the activity and secretion of MMP-9. The expression of MMP-9 was done using RT-PCR at the translational level and Immunoblotting at the transcriptional level. RESULTS: A significant inhibition of proliferation was seen in both cell lines starting at a concentration of 200mug/ml and in a dose dependent manner. SNS induced a dose dependent decrease in Tax expression, which was paralleled by a down-regulation of the nuclearization of NF-kappaB. This culminated in the inhibition of the activity of MMP-9 and their expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that a specific nutrient synergy targeted multiple levels pertinent to the progression of ATL. Its activity was mediated through the NF-kappaB pathway, and hence has the potential to be integrated in the treatment of this disease as a natural potent anticancer agent.","['Harakeh, Steve', 'Azar, Rania', 'Azhar, Esam', 'Damanhouri, Ghazi A', 'Assidi, Mourad', 'Abu-Elmagd, Muhammad', 'Alqahtani, Mohammed H', 'Kumosani, Taha', 'Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra', 'Rath, Mathias', 'Al-Hejin, Ahmed', 'Barbour, Elie', 'Diab-Assaf, Mona']","['Harakeh S', 'Azar R', 'Azhar E', 'Damanhouri GA', 'Assidi M', 'Abu-Elmagd M', 'Alqahtani MH', 'Kumosani T', 'Niedzwiecki A', 'Rath M', 'Al-Hejin A', 'Barbour E', 'Diab-Assaf M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150115,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/virology', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC4331725,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-15-S1-S2 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-15-S1-S2 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Cancer. 2015;15 Suppl 1:S2. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-15-S1-S2.

This study was conducted to determine the BLV infection status in Central Anatolia Region of Turkey, an important milk production centre, and to examine the risk factors such as purchasing cattle, increasing cattle age, cattle breed and herd size associated with transmission of BLV infection. To estimate the rate of BLV infection, a survey for specific antibodies in 28,982 serum samples from animals belonging to 1116 different herds situated in Central Anatolia Region of Turkey were tested from January 2006 to December 2013. A generalized mixed linear model was used to evaluate the risk factors that influenced BLV seroprevalence. Antibodies against BLV were detected in 431 (2.28 %) of 18,822 Holstein and 29 (0.28 %) of 10,160 Brown Swiss cows. Among 1116 herds, 132 herds (11.82 %) had one or more positive animals. Also results of our study show that the prevalence of BLV infection increased from 2006 to 2011, and it tends to reduce with BLV control programme. Furthermore, we found positive associations between percentage of seropositive animal and increasing cattle age, herd size, cattle breed and purchased cattle. Age-specific prevalence showed that BLV prevalence increased with age. These factors should be taken into consideration for control of BLV infection.","['Sevik, Murat', 'Avci, Oguzhan', 'Ince, Omer Baris']","['Sevik M', 'Avci O', 'Ince OB']","['Molecular Microbiology, Veterinary Control Institute, 42080, Meram, Konya, Turkey, dr_muratank@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150224,United States,Trop Anim Health Prod,Tropical animal health and production,1277355,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/11/13 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11250-015-0783-x [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Anim Health Prod. 2015 Apr;47(4):715-20. doi: 10.1007/s11250-015-0783-x.

Cardiac surgeons are not necessarily familiar with or are challenged by the many underlying etiologies. Analyzing risk factors for mortality may help to estimate the benefit of surgery in high-risk patients. METHODS: Patients undergoing a surgical pericardiotomy for malignant PE, between 2001 and 2011, were included. The influence of tumor type, disease extension, intra-pericardial tumor infiltration on early mortality and long-term survival as well as freedom from symptoms after drainage, and the use of sclerosing agents on PE recurrence rates was analyzed. RESULTS: PE drainage was performed on 46 patients 12 +/- 30 months after tumor diagnosis. Malignant diseases were lung cancers (50 %), breast cancers (15 %), lymphoma and leukemia (13 %), cancers of the digestive tract (13 %), and others (9 %). 80 % of patients were symptomatic and symptom relief was achieved in 65 %. Nobody died during surgery. Recurrence rate was 4 %. Early in-hospital mortality was 22 %. After 1 year, 29 % of patients were alive. Eleven patients (24 %) had a complete tumor regression. Metastatic spread (p < 0.001), pericardial infiltration (p = 0.02), and intra-pericardial Bleomycin (p = 0.01) injection were associated with increased mortality. Hematological malignancies had a better prognosis for survival. CONCLUSION: Surgical pericardiotomy is safe, associated with a low recurrence rate and symptom relief in the majority of dyspneic patients. Intra-pericardial Bleomycin may reduce recurrent effusion but does not ameliorate survival. Long-term survival rate was low with an increased mortality in cases of metastatic spreading, pericardial infiltration, and as the tumor of origin: breast cancers. Leukemic and lymphatic tumors have better prognosis.","['Niclauss, Lars', 'Montemurro, Michael', 'Pretre, Rene']","['Niclauss L', 'Montemurro M', 'Pretre R']","['Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital of Lausanne, 46, rue du Bugnon, 1011, Lausanne, Switzerland, lars.niclauss@chuv.ch.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Surg,World journal of surgery,7704052,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications/surgery', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/complications/surgery', '*Drainage', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/complications/surgery', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications/surgery', 'Lymphoma/complications/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*mortality', 'Pericardial Effusion/etiology/*surgery', 'Pericardiectomy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,2015/02/25 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00268-015-3025-5 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Surg. 2015 Jul;39(7):1767-72. doi: 10.1007/s00268-015-3025-5.,,,,,,['World J Surg. 2016 Feb;40(2):480-1.

There was little difference between common and the IgD and NS myeloma patients with respect to prognostic factors although the IgD group had a higher beta 2 microglobulin at diagnosis, shorter time to transplantation, and more T cell depletion. IgD and NS patients had a significantly greater achievement of complete remission at conditioning but this did not translate into equivalent progression-free survival and overall survival for the IgD patients although the NS outcome was very similar to that of common myeloma.

The conditioning therapy has been involved in the impairment of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). However, the potential implication of MSCs in the pathophysiology of cGVHD has not been investigated. We analyzed expanded MSCs from patients with cGVHD and compared them with those from transplantation patients without cGVHD. The MSCs from both groups were of host origin and their reserves were comparable. They showed similar morphology, immunophenotype, population doubling times, self-renewal capacity, differentiation, and migration potential. The immunomodulatory potential of the 2 groups was also identical, they were both capable of inhibiting phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) proliferation and inducing regulatory T cells after coculturing with CD4(+) T cells, and the immunosuppressive factors were secreted similarly in both MSCs whether in normal culture or coculture with PBMCs. No significant differences were observed in the cellular senescence and apoptosis between 2 groups. In addition, MSCs from patients with cGVHD displayed normal phenotype and function compared with their counterparts from healthy donors, although reduced frequency in BM mononuclear cell fraction was observed in these patients. Taken together, our results suggest that MSCs do not seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of cGVHD and indicate the feasibility of autologous cell therapy in patients who are not completely responding to standard immunosuppressive therapy for cGVHD.","['Wang, Binsheng', 'Hu, Yongxian', 'Liu, Lizhen', 'Hu, Kaimin', 'Tie, Ruxiu', 'He, Ying', 'Fu, Shan', 'Zhu, Ni', 'Luo, Yi', 'Yu, Xiaohong', 'Huang, He']","['Wang B', 'Hu Y', 'Liu L', 'Hu K', 'Tie R', 'He Y', 'Fu S', 'Zhu N', 'Luo Y', 'Yu X', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

The leukemic condition itself and its therapy cause oral signs and symptoms with significant morbidity. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to review the oral health status in children with leukemia and relate the gingival and periodontal findings to the changes in their hematological values. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The oral health status in 47 pediatric leukemic patients in the age group of 6 to 14 years was assessed using the dmft/DMFT index, OHI(S) index and modified gingival index (MGI). Their hematological reports on the day of examination were obtained. The patients were divided into three groups based on the status of treatment. The relation between the platelet count and the WBC count with the MGI score was checked. RESULTS: The highest dmf and DMF scores were seen in patients who were currently under treatment. Though an inverse relation was seen between the platelet count and the MGI score, a statistically significant value was not obtained.

Vitamin D has immune modulatory effects on T cells through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) in vitro. It is unclear how oral vitamin D treatment affects VDR expression. The aim of this study was to establish a flow cytometry protocol, including nuclear and cytoplasmic VDR expression, and to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on T cell VDR expression in CD patients. The flow cytometry protocol for VDR staining was developed using the human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). The protocol was evaluated in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vitamin D3- (n = 9) and placebo-treated (n = 9) CD patients. Anti-VDR-stained PBMCs were examined by flow cytometry, and their cytokine production was determined by cytokine bead array. VDR, CYP27B1 and RXRalpha mRNA expression levels in CD4(+) T cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The flow cytometry protocol enabled detection of cytoplasmic and nuclear VDR expression. The results were confirmed by confocal microscopy and supported by correlation with VDR mRNA expression. VDR expression in CD4(+) T cells increased following stimulation. This VDR up-regulation was inhibited with 30% by vitamin D treatment compared to placebo in CD patients (P = 0027). VDR expression was correlated with in-vitro interferon-gamma production in stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.01). Flow cytometry is a useful method with which to measure intracellular VDR expression. Vitamin D treatment in CD patients reduces T cell receptor-mediated VDR up-regulation.","['Bendix, M', 'Dige, A', 'Deleuran, B', 'Dahlerup, J F', 'Jorgensen, S P', 'Bartels, L E', 'Husted, L B', 'Harslof, T', 'Langdahl, B', 'Agnholt, J']","['Bendix M', 'Dige A', 'Deleuran B', 'Dahlerup JF', 'Jorgensen SP', 'Bartels LE', 'Husted LB', 'Harslof T', 'Langdahl B', 'Agnholt J']","['Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Medicine, Regional Hospital Horsens, Horsens, Denmark.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150505,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Placebos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (VDR protein, human)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.14.15.18 (25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crohn Disease/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Placebos', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vitamin D/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC4469152,2015/02/25 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2015/02/25 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cei.12613 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2015 Jul;181(1):19-28. doi: 10.1111/cei.12613.

Cell-cell interactions between protumoral TAMs and lymphoma or leukemia cells may play an important role in lymphoma or leukemia microenvironments.

The extent to which low-dose radiation from natural sources contributes to the risk of childhood cancer remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: In a nationwide census-based cohort study, we investigated whether the incidence of childhood cancer was associated with background radiation from terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays. METHODS: Children < 16 years of age in the Swiss National Censuses in 1990 and 2000 were included. The follow-up period lasted until 2008, and incident cancer cases were identified from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. A radiation model was used to predict dose rates from terrestrial and cosmic radiation at locations of residence. Cox regression models were used to assess associations between cancer risk and dose rates and cumulative dose since birth. RESULTS: Among 2,093,660 children included at census, 1,782 incident cases of cancer were identified including 530 with leukemia, 328 with lymphoma, and 423 with a tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Hazard ratios for each millisievert increase in cumulative dose of external radiation were 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) for any cancer, 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for leukemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.05) for lymphoma, and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for CNS tumors. Adjustment for a range of potential confounders had little effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that background radiation may contribute to the risk of cancer in children, including leukemia and CNS tumors.","['Spycher, Ben D', 'Lupatsch, Judith E', 'Zwahlen, Marcel', 'Roosli, Martin', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Grotzer, Michael A', 'Rischewski, Johannes', 'Egger, Matthias', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Spycher BD', 'Lupatsch JE', 'Zwahlen M', 'Roosli M', 'Niggli F', 'Grotzer MA', 'Rischewski J', 'Egger M', 'Kuehni CE']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Background Radiation/*adverse effects', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",PMC4455589,2015/02/24 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1408548 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2015 Jun;123(6):622-8. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1408548.

Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is commonly associated with transcriptional activation of genes. H3K4 methylation in mammalian cells is carried out by COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)-like complexes that are composed of catalytic subunits such as MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) and multiple regulatory subunits in which WDR5 (WD40 repeat-containing protein 5), RBBP5 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 5), ASH2 (absent, small or homoeotic discs 2) and DPY30 [constituting the WRAD sub-complex (WDR5-ASH2-RBBP5-DPY30 complex)] are the major ones shared from yeast to metazoans. We report, in the present paper, a new mode of spatial regulation of H3K4 methyltransferase complexes. PAQR3 (progestin and adipoQ receptors member 3), a tumour suppressor specifically localized in the Golgi apparatus, negatively regulates H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in mammalian cells. Consistently, HOXC8 and HOXA9 gene expression was negatively regulated by PAQR3 expression levels. Hypoxia-induced H3K4me3 was augmented by PAQR3 knockdown and suppressed by PAQR3 overexpression in AGS gastric cancer cells. PAQR3 was able to interact directly or indirectly with the four members of the WRAD sub-complex and tether them to the Golgi apparatus, accompanied by reduction in histone methyltransferase activity in the nucleus. PAQR3 also interfered with the interaction of WDR5 with the C-terminus of MLL1 (C-ter). Collectively, our study indicates that PAQR3 negatively modulates H3K4 methylation via altering the subcellular compartmentalization of the core regulatory subunits of the COMPASS-like complexes in mammalian cells.","['Liu, Chunchun', 'Zhang, Yuxue', 'Hou, Yongfan', 'Shen, Liqiang', 'Li, Yinlong', 'Guo, Weiwei', 'Xu, Daqian', 'Liu, Gaigai', 'Zhao, Zilong', 'Man, Kaiyang', 'Pan, Yi', 'Wang, Zhenzhen', 'Chen, Yan']","['Liu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Hou Y', 'Shen L', 'Li Y', 'Guo W', 'Xu D', 'Liu G', 'Zhao Z', 'Man K', 'Pan Y', 'Wang Z', 'Chen Y']","['*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', 'daggerCollege of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'double daggerDepartment of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', 'section signSchool of Life Sciences and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '*Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (PAQR3 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Subunits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20141392 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20141392 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2015 May 1;467(3):415-24. doi: 10.1042/BJ20141392.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We immunoscreened 10(6) pfu with autologous sera and identified an antigen which we named GKT-AML8. The cDNA showed more than 99% similarity to a sequence on 2q21.2 and 95% sequence similarity to a sequence on 19q13.3. These genes were named ZNF465 and ZNF466, respectively, following HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) guidelines. Expressed sequence tag data suggests that both genes are transcriptionally active. ZNF465 and ZNF466 encode a 5' kruppel associated box domain typical of negative regulators of gene transcription. We have confirmed the translational start site in the +1 frame in a near-Kozak sequence that produces a 102 amino acid polypeptide from ZNF465. The high level of sequence similarity between ZNF465 and ZNF466 makes their transcripts almost indistinguishable by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, GKT-AML8 showed most sequence similarity to ZNF465 and no transcript matching the 3' ZNF466 sequence could be detected in patient samples or healthy volunteers. ZNF465/466 expression was detectable in 12/13 AML and 10/14 chronic myeloid leukaemia patients' samples but not in normal donor peripheral blood (0/8) or 0/3 bone marrow samples which had been separated into CD34(+) and CD34(-) samples. The altered expression of ZNF465/466 in patients' samples and its absence in healthy donor haematopoietic samples indicate that ZNF465 is overexpressed in early myeloid disease and as such may represent a promising target for immunotherapy.","['Collin, Joseph F', 'Wells, James W', 'Czepulkowski, Barbara', 'Lyne, Linden', 'Duriez, Patrick J', 'Banham, Alison H', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Guinn, Barbara-Ann']","['Collin JF', 'Wells JW', 'Czepulkowski B', 'Lyne L', 'Duriez PJ', 'Banham AH', 'Mufti GJ', 'Guinn BA']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, King's College London, The Rayne Institute, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ZNF465 protein, human)', '0 (ZNF465 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22242 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2015 May;54(5):288-302. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22242.

CSPG4 is a potential candidate tumor marker. We investigate CSPG4 expression on blasts in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and its relation with cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular markers known to have prognostic significance in this disease. Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), mAb 225.28, reactive with CSPG4. Blast samples obtained from the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed AML patients were analyzed for CSPG4 expression using the CSPG4-specific mAb and multiparameter flow cytometry. The results were correlated with cytogenetic and molecular characteristics of AML. CSPG4 was found to be expressed on a variable fraction of leukemic blasts in all AML patients with different leukemia morphology, including monoblastic cases. Reactivity of CSPG4-specific mAb with leukemic blasts was not limited to those with the rearranged MLL gene. CSPG4 was also expressed on AML blasts with a complex karyotype, FLT3 mutation, or NPM1 mutation. The results indicate that CSPG4 is expressed and detectable by flow cytometry using the mAb 225.28 on a proportion of blasts of all subtypes of AML irrespective of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. mAb 225.28 could be useful in detecting AML blasts by flow cytometry.","['Fenton, Moon', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Ferrone, Soldano', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Fenton M', 'Whiteside TL', 'Ferrone S', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CSPG4 protein, human)', '0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/immunology/*metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Nucleophosmin']",PMC7838444,2015/02/24 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504014X14174484758503 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2015;22(2):117-21. doi: 10.3727/096504014X14174484758503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(-)-DHMEQ directly binds to NF-kappaB components to inhibit DNA binding, and moreover, it often inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The mechanism of inhibiting nuclear translocation has been elucidated for RelB, a main noncanonical NF-kappaB component. However, it was not elucidated for p65, a main canonical NF-kappaB component. In the present research, we studied how (-)-DHMEQ inhibits nuclear localization of p65. First, (-)-DHMEQ inhibited p65 nuclear accumulation in adult T-cell leukemia MT-2 cells in which canonical p65 is constitutively activated. But there was no change in the stability and importin-alpha3 affinity of p65. Then, we prepared a p65 mutant protein with Arg35Ala and Tyr36Ala (AA) mutations having no DNA-binding ability in HeLa cells. The p65 AA mutant showed reduced nuclear localization without changing the stability and importin affinity. Taken together, the mechanism of inhibition is different between RelB and p65, and inhibition of p65 nuclear localization is likely to be due to the inhibition of DNA binding changing the equilibrium between the nuclear and cytoplasmic amounts of p65.","['Horie, Kana', 'Ma, Jun', 'Umezawa, Kazuo']","['Horie K', 'Ma J', 'Umezawa K']","['Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7838434,2015/02/24 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504014X14146137738628 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2015;22(2):105-15. doi: 10.3727/096504014X14146137738628.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study included 62 newly diagnosed AML patients >/= 70 years who were treated with intensive chemotherapy. The overall response rate (CR and CRp) was 56%. Patients with favorable or intermediate cytogenetics (p=0.0036) as well as those with primary AML (p=0.0212) had a higher response rate. The median overall survival for all patients was 6.85 months (95% CI 3.7-13.5 months). The median overall survival for patients achieving remission after intensive induction chemotherapy was significantly higher than those who did not respond to therapy (20.4 months vs. 3.5 months, p<0.001). The all-cause 4-week mortality rate was 11%, and the all-cause 8-week mortality rate was 17.7%.

Allo-HSCT however is an imperfect therapy associated with significant morbidity and mortality while offering only incomplete prevention of AML clinical relapse. These limitations have motivated the search for AML-related antigens that might be used as more specific and effective targets of immunotherapy. While historically such investigations have focused on protein targets expressed uniquely in AML or at significantly higher levels than in normal tissues, this article will review recent discoveries which have identified a novel selection of potential antigen targets for AML immunotherapy, such as non-protein targets including lipids and carbohydrates, neo-antigens created from genetic somatic mutations or altered splicing and post-translational modification of protein targets, together with innovative ways to target overexpressed protein targets presented by cell surface peptide-MHC complexes. These novel antigens represent promising candidates for further development as targets of AML immunotherapy.","['Goswami, Meghali', 'Hourigan, Christopher S']","['Goswami M', 'Hourigan CS']","['Myeloid Malignancies Section, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Room 6C-104, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1583, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carbohydrates)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*immunology', 'Carbohydrates/genetics/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",PMC6321986,2015/02/24 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1389450116666150223120005 [doi]', 'CDT-EPUB-65363 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2017;18(3):296-303. doi: 10.2174/1389450116666150223120005.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*antigens', '*immunotherapy.']",['ZIA HL006163-04/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS1003620'],,,,,,,,,,,,

CXCR4 is a co-receptor of CD4 molecule that facilitates HIV-1 entry into T lymphocytes and myeloid cells, whereas TRAF6 is involved in immune response. Thus, the role of miR-146a in HIV-1 infection is currently being thoroughly investigated. In this study, we found that PLZF mediates suppression of miR-146a to control increases of CXCR4 and TRAF6 protein levels in human primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes. We show that miR-146a upregulation by AMD3100 treatment or PLZF silencing, decreases CXCR4 protein expression and prevents HIV-1 infection of leukemic monocytic cell line and CD4(+) T lymphocytes.

Heterozygous mutations in the ELANE gene coding neutrophil elastase are associated with SCN. Patients with SCN suffer from recurrent bacterial infections and often succumb them. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SCN from Vietnam. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old boy was admitted due to severe bacterial infection and severe neutropenia. He had recurrent infections from 8 months of age, and was misdiagnosed with tuberculosis and and autoimmune neutropenia in infancy at 21 and 41 months of age, respectively. His medical report has showed severe neutropenia for many times. In direct DNA sequencing analysis, we found an ELANE gene mutation (R81P), which had been confirmed to cause SCN. CONCLUSION: The missed and delayed diagnosis may be attributable to insufficient awareness of this rare disease on the background of frequent infections even in the immunocompetent pediatric population in Vietnam. Our results indicate further evidence for the role of ELANE in SCN.","['Vu, Quang Van', 'Wada, Taizo', 'Tran, Tham Thi', 'Ngo, Duc Ngoc', 'Van Dinh, Thuc', 'Nguyen, Cuong Hung', 'Le, Huong Thi Minh', 'Yachie, Akihiro', 'Nguyen, Sang Ngoc']","['Vu QV', 'Wada T', 'Tran TT', 'Ngo DN', 'Van Dinh T', 'Nguyen CH', 'Le HT', 'Yachie A', 'Nguyen SN']","['Department of Pediatrics, Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 72 A Nguyen Binh Khiem, Ngo Quyen, Haiphong Vietnam.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 72 A Nguyen Binh Khiem, Ngo Quyen, Haiphong Vietnam.', 'Haiphong Children Hospital, Haiphong, Vietnam.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 72 A Nguyen Binh Khiem, Ngo Quyen, Haiphong Vietnam.', 'Center for Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam.', 'National Hospital of Pediatrics, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 72 A Nguyen Binh Khiem, Ngo Quyen, Haiphong Vietnam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150124,England,BMC Hematol,BMC hematology,101609487,,,,PMC4335412,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12878-015-0020-x [doi]', '20 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Hematol. 2015 Jan 24;15:2. doi: 10.1186/s12878-015-0020-x. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmune neutropenia', 'Congenital severe neutropenia', 'ELANE', 'Severe bacterial infection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are considered to be environmentally safe and, therefore, are increasingly used as pharmaceuticals, detergents, and personal care products. Although they display low to moderate toxicity in cells in culture, the underlying mechanisms of surfactant-mediated cytotoxicity are poorly investigated. RESULTS: We synthesized a series of triazole-linked (fluoro)alkyl beta-glucopyranosides using the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne reaction, one of many popular ""click"" reactions that enable efficient preparation of structurally diverse compounds, and investigate the toxicity of this novel class of surfactant in the Jurkat cell line. Similar to other carbohydrate surfactants, the cytotoxicity of the triazole-linked alkyl beta-glucopyranosides was low, with IC50 values decreasing from 1198 to 24 muM as the hydrophobic tail length increased from 8 to 16 carbons. The two alkyl beta-glucopyranosides with the longest hydrophobic tails caused apoptosis by mechanisms involving mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: Triazole-linked, glucose-based surfactants 4a-g and other carbohydrate surfactants may cause apoptosis, and not necrosis, at low micromolar concentrations via induction of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade; however, additional studies are needed to fully explore the molecular mechanisms of their toxicity.

Epigenetic gene silencing in cancer by DNA methylation contributes to the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, including miRNAs. We have recently shown that the promoter of miR-708 is aberrantly methylated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To characterize the molecular signaling networks that are influenced by miR-708, we performed a luciferase-based screen evaluating the effects of ectopic miR-708 expression on leukemia-relevant signaling pathways. We found that miR-708 strongly repressed NF-kappaB signaling, a pathway known to be deregulated in CLL. Among the predicted miR-708 targets was IKKbeta (inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, kinase-beta/IKBKB), a key kinase facilitating NF-kappaB signaling. We validated the interaction of miR-708 with the 3'-untranslated region of IKKbeta and found that miR-708 overexpression represses endogenous IKKbeta. Phosphorylation of the IKKbeta target IkappaBalpha and expression of known NF-kappaB target genes were impaired by miR-708. Furthermore, we identified an enhancer region downstream of the miR-708 promoter that displays a distinct DNA methylation status in CLL. High enhancer methylation is significantly correlated with lower miR-708 expression and is predominantly found in patients with poor prognosis and shorter time to treatment. These results demonstrate that miR-708 regulates the NF-kappaB pathway by targeting IKKbeta, and that methylation of a key enhancer region contributes to its suppression in CLL.","['Baer, Constance', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Kim-Wanner, Soo-Zin', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Byrd, John C', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Baer C', 'Oakes CC', 'Ruppert AS', 'Claus R', 'Kim-Wanner SZ', 'Mertens D', 'Zenz T', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Byrd JC', 'Plass C']","['Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN708 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29491 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Sep 15;137(6):1352-61. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29491.

Here we report the activity and acute toxicity of the farnesyl transferase inhibitor tipifarnib, the response rate to 13-cis retinoic acid (CRA) in combination with cytoreductive chemotherapy, and survival following HSCT in children with JMML. PROCEDURE: Eighty-five patients with newly diagnosed JMML were enrolled on AAML0122 between 2001 and 2006. Forty-seven consented to receive tipifarnib in a phase II window before proceeding to a phase III trial of CRA in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine followed by HSCT and maintenance CRA. Thirty-eight patients enrolled only in the phase III trial. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 51% after tipifarnib and 68% after fludarabine/cytarabine/CRA. Tipifarnib did not increase pre-transplant toxicities. Forty-six percent of the 44 patients who received protocol compliant HSCT relapsed. Five-year overall survival was 55 +/- 11% and event-free survival was 41 +/- 11%, with no significant difference between patients who did or did not receive tipifarnib. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of tipifarnib in the window setting followed by HSCT in patients with newly diagnosed JMML was safe and yielded a 51% initial response rate as a single agent, but failed to reduce relapse rates or improve long-term overall survival.","['Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Ward, Ashley F', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Liu, Y Lucy', 'Emanuel, Peter D', 'Widemann, Brigitte C', 'Cheng, Jennifer W', 'Jayaprakash, Nalini', 'Balis, Frank M', 'Castleberry, Robert P', 'Bunin, Nancy J', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Cooper, Todd M']","['Stieglitz E', 'Ward AF', 'Gerbing RB', 'Alonzo TA', 'Arceci RJ', 'Liu YL', 'Emanuel PD', 'Widemann BC', 'Cheng JW', 'Jayaprakash N', 'Balis FM', 'Castleberry RP', 'Bunin NJ', 'Loh ML', 'Cooper TM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141208,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolones)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.5.1.21 (Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isotretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*drug therapy/enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinolones/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC4339233,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25342 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Apr;62(4):629-36. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25342.

We sought to determine whether the more affordable drug cladribine (Clad) can provide a viable alternative to Clo, with or without panobinostat (Pano) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). Both Clad+Flu+Bu and Clo+Flu+Bu combinations showed synergistic cytotoxicity in KBM3/Bu250(6), HL60, and OCI-AML3 cell lines. Cell exposure to these drug combinations resulted in 60%-80% inhibition of proliferation; activation of the ATM pathway; increase in histone modifications; decrease in HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5 and SirT7 proteins; decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential; activation of apoptosis and stress signaling pathways; and downregulation of the AKT pathway. These drug combinations activated DNA-damage response and apoptosis in primary cell samples from AML patients. At lower concentrations of Clad/Clo, Flu, and Bu, inclusion of Pano and DAC enhanced cell killing, increased histone modifications and DNA demethylation, and increased the levels of P16/INK4a, P15/INK4b and P21/Waf1/Cip1 proteins. The observed DNA demethylating activity of Clad and Clo may complement DAC activity; increase demethylation of the gene promoters for SFRP1, DKK3, and WIF1; and cause degradation of beta-catenin in cells exposed to Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu+DAC+Pano. The overlapping activities of Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu, Pano, and DAC in DNA-damage formation and repair, histone modifications, DNA demethylation, and apoptosis may underlie their synergism. Our results provide a basis for supplanting Clo with Clad and for including epigenetic modifiers in the pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen for myeloid leukemia patients.","['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Li, Yang', 'Murray, David', 'Ji, Jie', 'Liu, Yan', 'Popat, Uday', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Li Y', 'Murray D', 'Ji J', 'Liu Y', 'Popat U', 'Champlin RE', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

The mechanism of fibrosis was investigated by comparing TGF-beta1 signaling of marrow and spleen of patients with PMF and of non-diseased individuals. Expression of 39 (23 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated) and 38 (8 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated) TGF-beta1 signaling genes was altered in the marrow and spleen of PMF patients, respectively. Abnormalities included genes of TGF-beta1 signaling, cell cycling and abnormal in chronic myeloid leukemia (EVI1 and p21(CIP)) (both marrow and spleen) and Hedgehog (marrow only) and p53 (spleen only) signaling. Pathway analyses of these alterations predict an increased osteoblast differentiation, ineffective hematopoiesis and fibrosis driven by non-canonical TGF-beta1 signaling in marrow and increased proliferation and defective DNA repair in spleen. Since activation of non-canonical TGF-beta1 signaling is associated with fibrosis in autoimmune diseases, the hypothesis that fibrosis in PMF results from an autoimmune process triggered by dead megakaryocytes was tested by determining that PMF patients expressed plasma levels of mitochondrial DNA and anti-mitochondrial antibodies greater than normal controls.

Through an unbiased metabolomics analysis of leukemia cells, we found that the glycogenic precursor UDP-D-glucose is pervasively upregulated, despite low glycogen levels. Targeting the rate-limiting glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) not only decreased glycolytic flux but also increased activation of the glycogen-responsive AMP kinase (AMPK), leading to significant growth suppression. Further, genetic and pharmacological hyper-activation of AMPK was sufficient to induce the changes observed with GYS1 targeting. Cancer genomics data also indicate that elevated levels of the glycogenic enzymes GYS1/2 or GBE1 (glycogen branching enzyme 1) are associated with poor survival in AML. These results suggest a novel mechanism whereby leukemic cells sustain aberrant proliferation by suppressing excess AMPK activity through elevated glycogenic flux and provide a therapeutic entry point for targeting leukemia cell metabolism.","['Bhanot, Haymanti', 'Reddy, Mamatha M', 'Nonami, Atsushi', 'Weisberg, Ellen L', 'Bonal, Dennis', 'Kirschmeier, Paul T', 'Salgia, Sabrina', 'Podar, Klaus', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Chowdary, Tirumala K', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Tonon, Giovanni', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Asara, John', 'Griffin, James D', 'Sattler, Martin']","['Bhanot H', 'Reddy MM', 'Nonami A', 'Weisberg EL', 'Bonal D', 'Kirschmeier PT', 'Salgia S', 'Podar K', 'Galinsky I', 'Chowdary TK', 'Neuberg D', 'Tonon G', 'Stone RM', 'Asara J', 'Griffin JD', 'Sattler M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Center for Biomedical Imaging in Oncology (CBIO), Lurie Family Imaging Center (LFIC), Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Center for Biomedical Imaging in Oncology (CBIO), Lurie Family Imaging Center (LFIC), Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'University of Heidelberg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'School of Biological Sciences, National Institute of Science Education & Research, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Division of Signal Transduction/Mass Spectrometry Core, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9005-79-2 (Glycogen)', 'EC 2.4.1.11 (Glycogen Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycogen/*biosynthesis', 'Glycogen Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', '*Metabolomics', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4497855,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2015.46 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1555-1563. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.46.

Incidence calculations were performed using data from a centralized flow cytometry laboratory servicing southern Alberta, Canada. The age-standardized incidence of 4.01 cases of CLL per 100,000 person-years is nearly half the rate previously reported in Canada. Compared to previous criteria based on absolute lymphocyte count rather than absolute B-cell count, utilizing the 2008 WHO criteria resulted in a 47.6% decline in CLL incidence (8.42 cases per 100,000 using 1996 criteria). As a consequence, MBL rates are 64% higher. In contrast to 1996 criteria showing a peak CLL incidence between ages 70-74, age-specific incidence rates show a continuous increase with advancing age using the 2008 guidelines. We also report a higher male to female ratio of CLL than previous Canadian reports (1.80:1). CLL incidence in southern Alberta is lower than rates recently reported in the United States using the same criteria. This difference may be due in part to the low median age and the lower proportion of persons of Caucasian European ancestry present in our study population.","['Healey, Ryan', 'Patel, Jay L', 'de Koning, Lawrence', 'Naugler, Christopher']","['Healey R', 'Patel JL', 'de Koning L', 'Naugler C']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) offers the opportunity for rapid diagnosis in many paediatric haematological conditions, where phenotypes are variable and either a large number of genes are involved, or the genes are large making sanger sequencing expensive and labour-intensive. NGS offers the potential for gene discovery in patients who do not have mutations in currently known genes. This report shows how WES was used in the diagnosis of six paediatric haematology cases. In four cases (Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, congenital neutropenia (n = 2), and Fanconi anaemia), the diagnosis was suspected based on classical phenotype, and NGS confirmed those suspicions. Mutations in RPS19, ELANE and FANCD2 were found. The final two cases (MYH9 associated macrothrombocytopenia associated with multiple congenital anomalies; atypical juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia associated with a KRAS mutation) highlight the utility of NGS where the diagnosis is less certain, or where there is an unusual phenotype.

Angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) is a crucial factor regulating tumor angiopoiesis. Deregulation of angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of many cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In CLL, ANGPT2 is a well-studied potential prognostic marker. As MCPH1 overlaps with the ANGPT2 transcription unit on the same chromosome but in the opposite orientation, we wanted to study the functional role of MCPH1 in regulation of ANGPT2 in CLL. The mRNA expression levels of MCPH1 and ANGPT2, including the MCPH1 target gene hTERT, showed significant differences between two prognostic groups, i.e. IGHV-mutated and IGHV-unmutated (P = 0.007 for MCPH1, P = 0.0002 for ANGPT2, and P = 0.00001 for hTERT), in which the expression level of MCPH1 was inversely correlated with the expression levels of hTERT and ANGPT2. Downregulation of MCPH1 resulted in upregulation of ANGPT2, accompanied by loss of its promoter methylation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we found that MCPH1 binds to the ANGPT2 promoter and recruits DNA methyltransferases, thereby silencing ANGPT2. Thus, our data suggest a novel function for MCPH1 in regulating and maintaining ANGPT2 silencing in CLL through regulation of promoter DNA methylation.","['Kopparapu, Pradeep Kumar', 'Miranda, Caroline', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Mishra, Kankadeb', 'Andersson, Per-Ola', 'Kanduri, Chandrasekhar', 'Kanduri, Meena']","['Kopparapu PK', 'Miranda C', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Mishra K', 'Andersson PO', 'Kanduri C', 'Kanduri M']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Boras Hospital, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150309,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (ANGPT2 protein, human)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (MCPH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-2/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.13245 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2015 May;282(10):1939-52. doi: 10.1111/febs.13245.

In CD4(+) cells from peripheral blood, CADM1(-) CD7(+) (P), CADM1(+) CD7(dim) (D) and CADM1(+) CD7(-) (N) subpopulations are observed. The D and N subpopulations increase as asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (AC) progress to indolent adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and the N subpopulation then expands in aggressive ATL. In the present study we examined whether the analysis can estimate the risk of developing ATL in advanced AC. Peripheral blood samples from AC (N = 41) and indolent ATL patients (N = 19) were analyzed by flow cytometry using the CADM1 versus CD7 plot for CD4(+) cells and inverse long PCR (clonality analysis) of FACS-sorted subpopulations. Almost all AC with a high HTLV-1 proviral load (>4 copies/100 cells) had a CADM1(+) (D + N) frequency of >10%. AC with 25% < CADM1(+) </= 50% contained expanded clones similar to smoldering-type ATL.

METHODS: From 2009 to 2011, 54 CML-chronic phase (CP) patients with resistance (n = 40) or intolerance (n = 25) to imatinib were registered to undergo dasatinib treatment. Eleven patients showed both resistance and intolerance to imatinib. Coincidentally, the resistance criteria in this study were the same as a non-optimal response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as defined in the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2013 recommendations. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months was 62.3% (n = 47). Forty patients with resistance to imatinib who were 'warning' and 'failure' patients based on the ELN 2013 recommendations were assessed; cumulative MMR and MR(4.5) rates were 62.5% (n = 39) and 21.0% (n = 40), respectively, at 12 months. Twelve patients who showed a BCR-ABL transcript level >1% on the international scale did not achieve a MMR or discontinued dasatinib treatment because of insufficient effects. With regard to safety issues, grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-optimal responses (who meet ELN 2013 warning and failure criteria) to imatinib should be switched quickly to dasatinib, which is less toxic in CML-CP patients, to improve their prognoses. A BCR-ABL1 IS of <1% at 3 months of dasatinib administration is a landmark for good therapeutic outcome.","['Murai, Kazunori', 'Akagi, Tomoaki', 'Shimosegawa, Kenji', 'Sugawara, Tomohiro', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Ito, Shigeki', 'Murai, Keiko', 'Motegi, Mutsuhito', 'Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Noji, Hideyoshi', 'Tajima, Katsushi', 'Kimura, Jun', 'Chou, Takaaki', 'Ogawa, Kazuei', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Kubo, Kohmei', 'Oba, Koji', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Ishida, Yoji']","['Murai K', 'Akagi T', 'Shimosegawa K', 'Sugawara T', 'Ishizawa K', 'Ito S', 'Murai K', 'Motegi M', 'Yokoyama H', 'Noji H', 'Tajima K', 'Kimura J', 'Chou T', 'Ogawa K', 'Harigae H', 'Kubo K', 'Oba K', 'Sakamoto J', 'Ishida Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Iwate Prefectural Chubu Hospital, Kitakami, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaki Citizen Hospital, Osaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Morioka Red Cross Hospital, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Omagari Kosei Medical Center, Omagari, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology, Hematology, Metabolism, Endocrinology, and Diabetology (DNHMED), Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yamagata City Hospital Saiseikan, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology and Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokai Central Hospital, Kakamigahara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150325,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12536 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Dec;95(6):558-65. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12536.

In the study, we evaluated the use of a contemporary, individualized radiotherapeutic approach for splenic irradiation, including 3-dimensional computed tomography-based treatment planning, individualized treatment margins based on splenic motion assessment, online setup verification with volumetric image guidance at each fraction, and adaptive radiation treatment planning to account for changes in splenic size during the fractionated radiotherapy course. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Between December 2008 and January 2014, 18 patients (13 males, 5 females) with myeloproliferative disorders referred to Gulhane Military Medical Academy Radiation Oncology Department underwent 22 courses of splenic irradiation using 3-dimensional computed tomography-based treatment planning and volumetric image guidance for palliation of symptomatic splenomegaly. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years (range 28-79). Significant pain relief was achieved in 20 of the 22 splenic irradiation courses (90.9%). Improvement in hematological parameters was achieved in 8 of the 11 splenic irradiation courses applied for cytopenia (72.7%). At least a 50% reduction in splenic size was achieved in 18 of the 22 splenic irradiation courses (81.8%). Toxicity was manageable with supportive treatment including antiemetics and platelet or red blood cell transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic irradiation with a contemporary radiotherapeutic approach offers safe and effective palliation of symptomatic splenomegaly in myeloproliferative disorders.","['Sager, Omer', 'Beyzadeoglu, Murat', 'Dincoglan, Ferrat', 'Demiral, Selcuk', 'Uysal, Bora', 'Gamsiz, Hakan', 'Akin, Mustafa', 'Gundem, Esin', 'Dirican, Bahar']","['Sager O', 'Beyzadeoglu M', 'Dincoglan F', 'Demiral S', 'Uysal B', 'Gamsiz H', 'Akin M', 'Gundem E', 'Dirican B']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara - Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150203,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Precision Medicine', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications', 'Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/*etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/06/06 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['67890252-15A6-4C44-A4F2-EA44D3D1E787 [pii]', '10.5301/tj.5000221 [doi]']",ppublish,Tumori. 2015 Jan-Feb;101(1):84-90. doi: 10.5301/tj.5000221.

We report a patient with CLL who developed recurrent ITP and life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage. Platelet counts remained extremely low despite massive platelet transfusion and treatment including steroids, immunoglobulin, and single-dose rituximab infusion. The bleeding stopped and platelet counts were increased to normal range 13 days after treatment with eltrombopag 25 mg per day.

By acting on phagocytes, notably macrophages, apoptotic cells inhibit immunological and inflammatory responses and promote trophic signaling pathways. Paradoxically, because of their potential to cause death of tumor cells and thereby militate against malignant disease progression, both apoptosis and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are often associated with poor prognosis in cancer. We hypothesized that, in progression of malignant disease, constitutive loss of a fraction of the tumor cell population through apoptosis could yield tumor-promoting effects. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that apoptotic tumor cells promote coordinated tumor growth, angiogenesis, and accumulation of TAMs in aggressive B cell lymphomas. Through unbiased ""in situ transcriptomics"" analysis-gene expression profiling of laser-captured TAMs to establish their activation signature in situ-we show that these cells are activated to signal via multiple tumor-promoting reparatory, trophic, angiogenic, tissue remodeling, and anti-inflammatory pathways. Our results also suggest that apoptotic lymphoma cells help drive this signature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, upon induction of apoptosis, lymphoma cells not only activate expression of the tumor-promoting matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP12 in macrophages but also express and process these MMPs directly. Finally, using a model of malignant melanoma, we show that the oncogenic potential of apoptotic tumor cells extends beyond lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its profound tumor-suppressive role, apoptosis can potentiate cancer progression. These results have important implications for understanding the fundamental biology of cell death, its roles in malignant disease, and the broader consequences of apoptosis-inducing anti-cancer therapy.","['Ford, Catriona A', 'Petrova, Sofia', 'Pound, John D', 'Voss, Jorine J L P', 'Melville, Lynsey', 'Paterson, Margaret', 'Farnworth, Sarah L', 'Gallimore, Awen M', 'Cuff, Simone', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Dobbin, Edwina', 'Ogden, Carol Anne', 'Dumitriu, Ingrid E', 'Dunbar, Donald R', 'Murray, Paul G', 'Ruckerl, Dominik', 'Allen, Judith E', 'Hume, David A', 'van Rooijen, Nico', 'Goodlad, John R', 'Freeman, Tom C', 'Gregory, Christopher D']","['Ford CA', 'Petrova S', 'Pound JD', 'Voss JJ', 'Melville L', 'Paterson M', 'Farnworth SL', 'Gallimore AM', 'Cuff S', 'Wheadon H', 'Dobbin E', 'Ogden CA', 'Dumitriu IE', 'Dunbar DR', 'Murray PG', 'Ruckerl D', 'Allen JE', 'Hume DA', 'van Rooijen N', 'Goodlad JR', 'Freeman TC', 'Gregory CD']","[""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", 'Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", 'University of Edinburgh Departments of Haematology and Pathology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, UK.', ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK; Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."", 'Cancer Research United Kingdom (CRUK) Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, UK.', 'Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, UK.', 'The Roslin Institute, R(D)SVS, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush EH25 9RG, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Free University Medical Centre, P.O.

EGFR signaling occurs concurrently with ligand-receptor binding and subsequent endocytosis, and its signaling strength and engagement of different downstream signaling components are modulated by its endocytic trafficking itinerary. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that modulate ligand-bound EGFR's endocytic trafficking is therefore important for deciphering its role in pathophysiological processes. Endocytic trafficking of EGFR is regulated by a bunch of Rab small GTPases associated with the endocytic pathway. In this chapter, we describe a suite of relatively standard protocols in dissecting the role of a particular Rab protein in EGFR endocytic trafficking steps/stages. The approach constitutes a combination of genetic/molecular manipulations, followed by confocal imaging and a range of biochemical analyses. We shall mainly focus on Rab31 in our illustrations, but the approaches would be equally applicable to any Rab and its associated regulators/effectors.","['Chua, Christelle En Lin', 'Lim, Angeline Yim Kiat', 'Tang, Bor Luen']","['Chua CE', 'Lim AY', 'Tang BL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 8 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117597, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Ligands)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Endocytosis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Ligands', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2015/02/23 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-2309-0_18 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2015;1270:239-51. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-2309-0_18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data revealed that Hiwi protein expression was undetectable in K562 cells, and its overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M phases, and promoted apoptosis in K562 cells in vitro. Expression of anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, was decreased in cells expressing Hiwi, whereas that of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax, activated caspase-3, -9, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase were increased. Additionally, Hiwi upregulation enhanced the chemosensitivity of CML cells to daunomycin. Our study illustrates that expression deletion of Hiwi may be involved in the pathogenesis of human CML and suggests a possible role of Hiwi in regulating the cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis of CML cells in vitro.","['Wang, Yalin', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Bian, Cuicui', 'Dong, Yi', 'Ma, Chao', 'Hu, Xiaolin', 'Liu, Ziling']","['Wang Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Bian C', 'Dong Y', 'Ma C', 'Hu X', 'Liu Z']","[""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, Jilin, People's Republic of China. liuzilinglzl@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (PIWIL1 protein, human)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Argonaute Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2015/02/23 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-015-0668-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-015-0668-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 Sep;73(1):129-35. doi: 10.1007/s12013-015-0668-7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'Chemotherapy', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Hiwi']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here explored Hiwi's role in CML pathogenesis by determining how and whether its forced overexpression could affect CML cell growth and migration. The present results showed that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Hiwi significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced obvious apoptosis in K562 cells, a CML line cell line. Tumors in BALB/c nude mice generated by the K562 cells expressing Hiwi were much smaller than those formed by the control cells. Like in vitro, Hiwi upregulation induced cell apoptosis in the tumor tissues in vivo. Additionally, Hiwi elevation suppressed K562 cell migration and inhibited the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. In summary, our study demonstrates that Hiwi overexpression inhibits CML cell growth and migration, providing insights into its role in CML pathogenesis.","['Wang, Yalin', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Ma, Ning', 'Sang, Bailu', 'Hu, Xiaolin', 'Cong, Xiaofeng', 'Liu, Ziling']","['Wang Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Ma N', 'Sang B', 'Hu X', 'Cong X', 'Liu Z']","[""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, People's Republic of China. liuzilinglzl@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,"['0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (PIWIL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Argonaute Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2015/02/22 06:00'],"['2015/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-015-0651-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-015-0651-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 Sep;73(1):117-24. doi: 10.1007/s12013-015-0651-3.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell growth', 'Cell migration', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Hiwi', 'Matrix metalloproteinases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, drug resistance is the major clinical challenge in the treatment of CML. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and autophagy are both related to tumorigenesis, cancer therapy, and drug resistance. This study was conducted to explore whether the Hh pathway could regulate autophagy in CML cells and whether simultaneously regulating the Hh pathway and autophagy could induce cell death of drug-sensitive or -resistant BCR-ABL(+) CML cells. Our results indicated that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Hh pathway could markedly induce autophagy in BCR-ABL(+) CML cells. Autophagic inhibitors or ATG5 and ATG7 silencing could significantly enhance CML cell death induced by Hh pathway suppression. Based on the above findings, our study demonstrated that simultaneously inhibiting the Hh pathway and autophagy could markedly reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis of imatinib-sensitive or -resistant BCR-ABL(+) cells. Moreover, this combination had little cytotoxicity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, this combined strategy was related to PARP cleavage, CASP3 and CASP9 cleavage, and inhibition of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein.

Antral follicles are the functional ovarian units and must undergo growth, survival from atresia, and proper regulation of steroidogenesis to ovulate and produce hormones. Previous studies have determined that DEHP inhibits antral follicle growth and decreases estradiol levels in vitro; however, the mechanism by which DEHP elicits these effects is unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that DEHP directly alters regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis to inhibit antral follicle functionality. Antral follicles from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control or DEHP (1-100 mug/ml) for 24-96 h to establish the temporal effects of DEHP on the follicle. Following 24-96 h of culture, antral follicles were subjected to gene expression analysis, and media were subjected to measurements of hormone levels. DEHP increased the mRNA levels of cyclin D2, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 and decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A prior to growth inhibition. Additionally, DEHP increased the mRNA levels of BCL2-associated agonist of cell death, BCL2-associated X protein, BCL2-related ovarian killer protein, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-like 10, leading to an increase in atresia. Further, DEHP decreased the levels of progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone prior to the decrease in estradiol levels, with decreased mRNA levels of side-chain cleavage, 17alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-desmolase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase. Collectively, DEHP directly alters antral follicle functionality by inhibiting growth, inducing atresia, and inhibiting steroidogenesis.","['Hannon, Patrick R', 'Brannick, Katherine E', 'Wang, Wei', 'Gupta, Rupesh K', 'Flaws, Jodi A']","['Hannon PR', 'Brannick KE', 'Wang W', 'Gupta RK', 'Flaws JA']","['Department of Comparative Biosciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2001 S.

Prerequisites for the generation of effective immunoconjugates are antibodies which efficiently deliver the respective cytotoxic payload. To facilitate the selection of human or mouse antibodies that display favorable characteristics as immunotoxins, we developed a novel Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA)-based screening protein. The alpha-Fc-ETA' consists of a multispecies-specific Fc-binding domain antibody genetically fused to a truncated ETA version (ETA'). alpha-Fc-ETA' non-covalently bound to human and mouse antibodies but did not form immune complexes with bovine immunoglobulins. In combination with antibodies harboring human or mouse Fc domains alpha-Fc-ETA' inhibited proliferation of antigen-expressing tumor cells. The cytotoxic effects were strictly antibody dependent and were observed with low alpha-Fc-ETA' concentrations. Mouse antibodies directed against CD7 and CD317/HM1.24 that previously had been used for the generation of functional recombinant immunotoxins, also showed activity in combination with alpha-Fc-ETA' by inhibiting growth of antigen-positive myeloma and leukemia cell lines. In contrast, alpha-kappa-ETA', a similarly designed human kappa light chain-specific fusion protein, was only specifically active in combination with antibodies containing a human kappa light chain. Thus, the novel alpha-Fc-ETA' fusion protein is broadly applicable in screening antibodies and Fc-containing antibody derivatives from different species to select for candidates with favorable characteristics for immunotoxin development.","['Klausz, Katja', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Derer, Stefanie', 'Valerius, Thomas', 'Staudinger, Matthias', 'Burger, Renate', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Peipp, Matthias']","['Klausz K', 'Kellner C', 'Derer S', 'Valerius T', 'Staudinger M', 'Burger R', 'Gramatzki M', 'Peipp M']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.

DNA polyaptamer nanothreads of protein tyrosine kinase 7 receptor (PTK7) were synthesized by rolling cycle amplification. To strengthen the anchoring of polyaptamer nanothreads onto rGO, oligoT bridge domain was introduced between each repeating PTK7 aptamer sequence. As compared to PTK7 polyaptamer nanothreads alone, PTK7 polyaptamer nanothreads with 22-mer oligoT bridges (PNT) showed higher anchoring capacity onto rGO nanosheets. Nanothread-coated surface morphology of PNTrGO was observed. Coating of PNT did not affect the sizes of rGO, but reduced the zeta potential. In PTK7-negative Ramos cells, the uptake of PNT-anchored rGO (PNTrGO) did not differ from that of oligoT-bridged scrambled polyaptamer-anchored rGO (SNTrGO). However, in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells overexpressing PTK7, the uptake of PNTrGO was 2.1-fold higher than that of SNTrGO after 15 min pulse. In vivo distribution to CCRF-CEM tumor tissues was 2.8-fold higher in PNTrGO than in SNTrGO at 48 h post-injection. In CCRF-CEM xenografted mice, intravenously administered doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded PNTrGO showed the higher antitumor activity than other groups, reducing the tumor weight down to 12% of tumor weights of untreated mice.

In peripheral blood patients show anemia (mostly macrocytic), frequently accompanied by neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Thus, clinically the patients suffer from fatigue (anemia), increased bleeding (thrombocytopenia) and infectious complications (neutropenia). Approximately one quarter of MDS patients develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the course of the disease, which is characterized by a 20 % or more increase of blasts in the bone marrow. The estimated overall survival as well as the risk for AML transformation can be calculated with the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) as well as the revised IPSS score (IPSS-R). Novel sequencing methods (e.g. next generation sequencing) allow the detection of recurrent gene mutations in MDS patients. Genes of the splicing machinery as well as genes involved in epigenetic regulation (e.g. ASXL1 and TET2) are most frequently mutated in MDS. Therapy is selected based on the patient risk profile (IPSS). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative approach for high risk patients (i.e. IPSS int-2 and higher) with a good performance status and a biological age below 70 years. Otherwise, high risk patients are treated with demethylating agents (e.g. decitabine and azacitidine). Low risk patients (IPSS low and int-1) mainly receive supportive therapy including iron chelation. An exceptional position is presented by MDS with an isolated 5q deletion as it can be treated with lenalidomide with good success. Enrolling patients in clinical trials is strongly recommended to improve the prospects of this disease.","['Thol, F', 'Heuser, M', 'Ganser, A']","['Thol F', 'Heuser M', 'Ganser A']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Hamostaseologie, Onkologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Deutschland, thol.felicitas@mh-hannover.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/02/22 06:00'],"['2015/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00108-014-3598-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Internist (Berl). 2015 Apr;56(4):364-73. doi: 10.1007/s00108-014-3598-3.,,,,,,,,,Myelodysplastische Syndrome.,,,,,,,,

Structural basis for Notch1 engagement of Delta-like 4.,847-53,10.1126/science.1261093 [doi],"Notch receptors guide mammalian cell fate decisions by engaging the proteins Jagged and Delta-like (DLL). The 2.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the interacting regions of the Notch1-DLL4 complex reveals a two-site, antiparallel binding orientation assisted by Notch1 O-linked glycosylation. Notch1 epidermal growth factor-like repeats 11 and 12 interact with the DLL4 Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain and module at the N-terminus of Notch ligands (MNNL) domains, respectively. Threonine and serine residues on Notch1 are functionalized with O-fucose and O-glucose, which act as surrogate amino acids by making specific, and essential, contacts to residues on DLL4. The elucidation of a direct chemical role for O-glycans in Notch1 ligand engagement demonstrates how, by relying on posttranslational modifications of their ligand binding sites, Notch proteins have linked their functional capacity to developmentally regulated biosynthetic pathways.","['Luca, Vincent C', 'Jude, Kevin M', 'Pierce, Nathan W', 'Nachury, Maxence V', 'Fischer, Suzanne', 'Garcia, K Christopher']","['Luca VC', 'Jude KM', 'Pierce NW', 'Nachury MV', 'Fischer S', 'Garcia KC']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

In early-phase studies, ibrutinib demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The durable responses observed with ibrutinib relate in part to a modest toxicity profile that allows the majority of patients to receive continuous therapy for an extended period. We report on median 3-year follow-up of 132 patients with symptomatic treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Longer treatment with ibrutinib was associated with improvement in response quality over time and durable remissions. Toxicity with longer follow-up diminished with respect to occurrence of grade 3 or greater cytopenias, fatigue, and infections. Progression remains uncommon, occurring primarily in some patients with relapsed del(17)(p13.1) and/or del(11)(q22.3) disease. Treatment-related lymphocytosis remains largely asymptomatic even when persisting >1 year and does not appear to alter longer-term PFS and overall survival compared with patients with partial response or better. Collectively, these data provide evidence that ibrutinib controls CLL disease manifestations and is well tolerated for an extended period; this information can help direct potential treatment options for different subgroups to diminish the long-term risk of relapse.","['Byrd, John C', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Coutre, Steven E', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Coleman, Morton', 'Wierda, William G', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Shaw, Yun', 'Bilotti, Elizabeth', 'Zhou, Cathy', 'James, Danelle F', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Byrd JC', 'Furman RR', 'Coutre SE', 'Burger JA', 'Blum KA', 'Coleman M', 'Wierda WG', 'Jones JA', 'Zhao W', 'Heerema NA', 'Johnson AJ', 'Shaw Y', 'Bilotti E', 'Zhou C', 'James DF', ""O'Brien S""]","['The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'Stanford Cancer Center and Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/chemically induced', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Piperidines', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4400288,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31789-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-606038 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 16;125(16):2497-506. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-606038.

Our study demonstrates that GA may induce cell death through autophagy and apoptosis pathways in CML K562 cells. A cross-talk mechanism exists between GA-induced autophagy and apoptosis. However, the mechanism of GA for inducing autophagy and apoptosis need further clarification.","['Chen, Jinhao', 'Zhou, Min', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Xu, Jingyan', 'Ouyang, Jian']","['Chen J', 'Zhou M', 'Zhang Q', 'Xu J', 'Ouyang J']","['a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing, Jiangsu , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing, Jiangsu , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing, Jiangsu , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing, Jiangsu , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing, Jiangsu , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150520,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Xanthones)', '8N585K83U2 (gambogic acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1018251 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(10):2953-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1018251.

Here we describe a 69-year-old female with adult B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with hyperleukocytosis and immunophenotype CD10- and CD19+ with cryptic MLL rearrangements. G-banding at the time of diagnosis showed a normal karyotype: 46,XX. Molecular cytogenetics using multitude multicolor banding (mMCB) revealed a complex rearrangement of the two copies of chromosome 11. However, a locus-specific probe additionally identified that the MLL gene at 11q23.3 was disrupted, and that the 5' region was inserted into the chromosomal sub-band 4q21; thus the aberration involved three chromosomes and five break events. Unfortunately, the patient died six months after the initial diagnosis from serious infections and severe complications. Overall, the present findings confirm that, by far not all MLL aberrations are seen by routine chromosome banding techniques and that fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) should be regarded as standard tool to access MLL rearrangements in patients with BCP-ALL.","['Othman, Moneeb A K', 'Grygalewicz, Beata', 'Pienkowska-Grela, Barbara', 'Rincic, Martina', 'Rittscher, Katharina', 'Melo, Joana B', 'Carreira, Isabel M', 'Meyer, Britta', 'Marzena, Watek', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Othman MA', 'Grygalewicz B', 'Pienkowska-Grela B', 'Rincic M', 'Rittscher K', 'Melo JB', 'Carreira IM', 'Meyer B', 'Marzena W', 'Liehr T']","['Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany (MAKO, MR, KR, TL)', 'Cytogenetic Laboratory, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute, Warsaw, Poland (BG)', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland (BPG)', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany (MAKO, MR, KR, TL)', 'Croatian Institute of Brain Research, Zagreb, Croatia (MR)', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany (MAKO, MR, KR, TL)', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal (JBM, IMC)', 'CIMAGO, Centro de Investigacao em Meio Ambiente, Geneticae Oncobiologia University of Coimbra, (JBM, IMC)', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal (JBM, IMC)', 'CIMAGO, Centro de Investigacao em Meio Ambiente, Geneticae Oncobiologia University of Coimbra, (JBM, IMC)', 'ZytoVision GmbH, Bremerhaven, Germany (BM)', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Holy Cross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland (WM)', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany (MAKO, MR, KR, TL)']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150219,United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC4409947,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['0022155415576201 [pii]', '10.1369/0022155415576201 [doi]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2015 May;63(5):384-90. doi: 10.1369/0022155415576201.

PP2A is a potent tumor suppressor, which is inactivated in cancer cells as a result of genetic deletions and mutations. In myeloid leukemias, genes encoding PP2A subunits are generally intact. Instead, PP2A is functionally inhibited by post-translational modifications of its catalytic C subunit, and interactions with negative regulators by its regulatory B and scaffold A subunits. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of genetic and functional inactivation of PP2A in human cancers, with a particular focus on human acute myeloid leukemias (AML). By analyzing expression of genes encoding PP2A subunits using transcriptome sequencing, we find that PP2A dysregulation in AML is characterized by silencing and overexpression of distinct A scaffold and B regulatory subunits, respectively. We review the mechanisms of functional PP2A activation by drugs such as fingolimod, forskolin, OP449, and perphenazine. This analysis yields two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms for therapeutic PP2A re-activation: (i) allosteric activation of the phosphatase activity, and (ii) stabilization of active holo-enzyme assembly and displacement of negative regulatory factors from A and B subunits. Future studies should allow the development of specific and potent pharmacologic activators of PP2A, and definition of susceptible disease subsets based on specific mechanisms of PP2A dysregulation.","['Ramaswamy, Kavitha', 'Spitzer, Barbara', 'Kentsis, Alex']","['Ramaswamy K', 'Spitzer B', 'Kentsis A']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Department of Pediatrics, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Medical College of Cornell University , New York, NY , USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Department of Pediatrics, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Medical College of Cornell University , New York, NY , USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Department of Pediatrics, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Medical College of Cornell University , New York, NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150202,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC4313608,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00016 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Feb 2;5:16. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00016. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['enzyme activation', 'gene expression', 'kinase signaling', 'leukemia', 'protein phosphatase 2A']","['K08 CA160660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: JETL cells were irradiated with LPLI at 635nm and 780m wavelengths (energy density 9.174 J/cm(2)), and assessed for the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 by flow cytometry after 24, 48 and 72 incubation time periods (ITPs). RESULTS: At 24 hours ITP post-irradiation, control cultures showed that 10.7% of cells expressed HSP70, while LPLI cultures at 635nm and 780nm manifested a higher expression (32.1and 21.3%, respectively), and the difference was significant (P </= 0.05). However, at 48 hours ITP, the three means were decreased but approximated (5.6, 4.9 and 6.2%, respectively), while at 72 hours ITP, they were markedly increased (45.2, 76.5 and 66.7%, respectively). In contrast, HSP90 responded differently to LPLI. At 24 hours ITP, control cultures and 780nm cultures showed a similar expression (55.9 and 55.9%, respectively), but both means were significantly higher than that of 635nm cultures (24.0%). No such difference was observed at 48 hours ITP, and at 72 hours ITP, control cultures and 635nm cultures shared approximated means (31.7 and 35.6%, respectively); but both means were significantly higher than the observed mean in 780nm cultures (15.2%). CONCLUSION: The results highlighted that HSP70 and HSP90 expression responded differently to LPLI in JETL cells; an observation that may pave the way for further investigations in malignant cells.","[""Ad'hiah, Ali Hussein"", 'Al-Ameri, Layla Mohammed Hassan', 'Maki, Amel Mustfa', 'Wang, Qiuyu', 'ALQaisi, Mayada Hameed']","[""Ad'hiah AH"", 'Al-Ameri LM', 'Maki AM', 'Wang Q', 'ALQaisi MH']","['Tropical-Biological Research Unit, College of Science, University of Baghdad, Jadirya, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Tropical-Biological Research Unit, College of Science, University of Baghdad, Jadirya, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Institute of Laser for Postgraduate Studies, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'School of Healthcare Science, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK.', 'School of Healthcare Science, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,J Lasers Med Sci,Journal of lasers in medical sciences,101580415,,,,PMC4329137,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Lasers Med Sci. 2015 Winter;6(1):17-21.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Heat shock proteins', 'Jurkat cell', 'laser Irradiation', 'leukemia cell', 'low-Power']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients suffer from severe immune defects resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and failure to generate an antitumor immune response. Defects in both, DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and crosstalk with the tissue microenvironment have been reported to play a crucial role for the survival of CLL cells, therapy resistance and impaired immune response. To this end, major advances over the past years have highlighted several T cell immune evasion mechanisms in CLL. Here, we discuss the consequences of an impaired DDR pathway for detection and elimination of CLL cells by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are considered to be a major component of the immunosurveillance in leukemia but NK cell activity is impaired in CLL. Restoration of NK cell activity using immunoligands and immunoconstructs in combination with the conventional chemotherapy may provide a future perspective for CLL treatment.","['Shatnyeva, Olga M', 'Hansen, Hinrich P', 'Reiners, Katrin S', 'Sauer, Maike', 'Vyas, Maulik', 'von Strandmann, Elke Pogge']","['Shatnyeva OM', 'Hansen HP', 'Reiners KS', 'Sauer M', 'Vyas M', 'von Strandmann EP']","['Innate Immunity Group, Clinic 1 for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Innate Immunity Group, Clinic 1 for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Innate Immunity Group, Clinic 1 for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Innate Immunity Group, Clinic 1 for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Innate Immunity Group, Clinic 1 for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Innate Immunity Group, Clinic 1 for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150204,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC4316781,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2015.00011 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2015 Feb 4;6:11. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2015.00011. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunoconstructs', 'immunoligands', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 51 patients were eligible for analysis. Vaccination with WT1 peptides proved safe and feasible in patients with MDS/AML, in studies from different institutions. Additionally, clinical responses and clinical benefit were observed, with some patients achieving and maintaining remission long-term (more than 8 years). A significant correlation between induction of WT1-specific T cells and normalization/reduction of WT1 mRNA levels and progression-free survival was noted in a number of studies. However, larger studies are warranted to confirm these results. Interestingly, the majority of trials reported the presence of WT1-specific T cells with limited or absent functionality prior to vaccination, which increased in frequency and function after vaccination. In conclusion, WT1 peptide vaccination strategies were safe in this heterogeneous group of patient with MDS/AML. Larger and more homogeneous studies or randomized clinical trials are needed to quantify the contribution of WT1 peptide vaccines to clinical responses and long-term survival.","['Di Stasi, Antonio', 'Jimenez, Antonio M', 'Minagawa, Kentaro', 'Al-Obaidi, Mustafa', 'Rezvani, Katayoun']","['Di Stasi A', 'Jimenez AM', 'Minagawa K', 'Al-Obaidi M', 'Rezvani K']","['Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, The University of Alabama at Birmingham , Birmingham, AL , USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, Rush University Medical Center , Chicago, IL , USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, The University of Alabama at Birmingham , Birmingham, AL , USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, The University of Alabama at Birmingham , Birmingham, AL , USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150204,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC4316779,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2015.00036 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2015 Feb 4;6:36. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00036. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['MDS/AML', 'TAA', 'WT1', 'active immunotherapy', 'peptide vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Randomized trials show that prophylactic platelet transfusions mitigate bleeding in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. However, even with prophylactic transfusions, as many as 75% of patients, experience hemorrhage. While platelet transfusion efficacy is modest, questions and concerns have arisen about the risks of platelet transfusion therapy. The acknowledged serious risks of platelet transfusion include viral transmission, bacterial sepsis, and acute lung injury. Less serious adverse effects include allergic and non-hemolytic febrile reactions. Rare hemolytic reactions have occurred due to a common policy of transfusing without regard to ABO type. In the last decade or so, new concerns have arisen; platelet-derived lipids are implicated in transfusion-related acute lung injury after transfusion. With the recognition that platelets are immune cells came the discoveries that supernatant IL-6, IL-27 sCD40L, and OX40L are closely linked to febrile reactions and sCD40L with acute lung injury. Platelet transfusions are pro-inflammatory, and may be pro-thrombotic. Anti-A and anti-B can bind to incompatible recipient or donor platelets and soluble antigens, impair hemostasis and thus increase bleeding. Finally, stored platelet supernatants contain biological mediators such as VEGF and TGF-beta1 that may compromise the host versus tumor response. This is particularly of concern in patients receiving many platelet transfusions, as for acute leukemia. New evidence suggests that removing stored supernatant will improve clinical outcomes. This new view of platelets as pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents suggests that innovative approaches to improving platelet storage and pre-transfusion manipulations to reduce toxicity could substantially improve the efficacy and safety of this long-employed therapy.","['Stolla, Moritz', 'Refaai, Majed A', 'Heal, Joanna M', 'Spinelli, Sherry L', 'Garraud, Olivier', 'Phipps, Richard P', 'Blumberg, Neil']","['Stolla M', 'Refaai MA', 'Heal JM', 'Spinelli SL', 'Garraud O', 'Phipps RP', 'Blumberg N']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Auvergne-Loire, Universite de Lyon , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA ; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA ; Department of Environmental Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA ; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center , Rochester, NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150202,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC4313719,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2015.00028 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2015 Feb 2;6:28. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00028. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['bleeding', 'immune response', 'platelets', 'storage', 'thrombosis', 'transfusion', 'transfusion reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increased genomic dosage of trisomy 21 is thought to be responsible for the distinct DS phenotypes, including an increased risk of developing some types of childhood leukemia and germ cell tumors. Patients with DS, however, have a strikingly lower incidence of many other solid tumors. We hypothesized that the third copy of genes located in HSA21 may have an important role on the protective effect that DS patients show against most types of solid tumors. Focusing on Copy Number Variation (CNV) array data, we have generated frequencies of deleted regions in HSA21 in four different tumor types from which DS patients have been reported to be protected. We describe three different regions of deletion pointing to a set of candidate genes that could explain the inverse comorbidity phenomenon between DS and solid tumors. In particular we found RCAN1 gene in Wilms tumors and a miRNA cluster containing miR-99A, miR-125B2 and miR-LET7C in lung, breast, and melanoma tumors as the main candidates for explaining the inverse comorbidity observed between solid tumors and DS.","['Fores-Martos, Jaume', 'Cervera-Vidal, Raimundo', 'Chirivella, Enrique', 'Ramos-Jarero, Alberto', 'Climent, Joan']","['Fores-Martos J', 'Cervera-Vidal R', 'Chirivella E', 'Ramos-Jarero A', 'Climent J']","['Genomics and Systems Biology (InGSB) Lab, Oncology and Hematology Department, Biomedical Research Institute INCLIVA Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics and Systems Biology (InGSB) Lab, Oncology and Hematology Department, Biomedical Research Institute INCLIVA Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics and Systems Biology (InGSB) Lab, Oncology and Hematology Department, Biomedical Research Institute INCLIVA Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics and Systems Biology (InGSB) Lab, Oncology and Hematology Department, Biomedical Research Institute INCLIVA Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics and Systems Biology (InGSB) Lab, Oncology and Hematology Department, Biomedical Research Institute INCLIVA Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150204,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,,PMC4316712,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2015.00010 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2015 Feb 4;6:10. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2015.00010. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BTG3', 'Chr. 21p11', 'RCAN1', 'cancer genomics', 'down syndrome', 'inverse comorbidity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cells were isolated from the bone marrow of CML-BC patients and were treated with 1 muM ATO and 5 nM nilotinib, either alone or in combination. Cell proliferation was evaluated using a MTT assay. Cell morphology and the content of hemoglobin were examined with Wright-Giemsa staining and benzidine staining, respectively. The expression of cell surface markers was determined using flow cytometric analysis. The levels of mRNA and protein were analyzed using RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: ATO and nilotinib alone or in combination suppressed cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent pattern (P < 0.01 vs. control). Drug treatments promoted erythroid differentiation of CML-BC cells, with a decreased nuclei/cytoplasm ratio but increased hemoglobin content and glycophorin A (GPA) expression (P < 0.01 compared with control). In addition, macrophage and granulocyte lineage differentiation was also induced after drug treatment. The mRNA and protein levels of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1) and B cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) were both upregulated after 3 days of ATO and Nilotinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that ATO and nilotinib treatment alone or in combination greatly suppressed cell proliferation but promoted the differentiation of CML-BC cells towards multiple-lineages. Nilotinib alone preferentially induced erythroid differentiation while combined treatment with ATO preferentially induced macrophage and granulocyte lineage differentiation.","['Wang, Wei', 'Lv, Fei-Fei', 'Du, Yan', 'Li, Nannan', 'Chen, YaLing', 'Chen, LiHong']","['Wang W', 'Lv FF', 'Du Y', 'Li N', 'Chen Y', 'Chen L']","['Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (the 175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), NO.269, Zhanghua Middle Road, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (the 175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), NO.269, Zhanghua Middle Road, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (the 175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), NO.269, Zhanghua Middle Road, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (the 175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), NO.269, Zhanghua Middle Road, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (the 175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), NO.269, Zhanghua Middle Road, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (the 175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), NO.269, Zhanghua Middle Road, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000 China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150204,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC4334604,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:01,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-015-0158-4 [doi]', '158 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2015 Feb 4;15:10. doi: 10.1186/s12935-015-0158-4. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AMN107', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'CML-BC', 'Differentiation', 'Nilotinib', 'Proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study population included Ph(+) ALL patients who underwent haploidentical related allo-HSCT. Additionally, Ph(+) ALL patients who underwent HLA-matched related donor (MRD) transplants during the same period were included to compare outcomes. BCR-ABL transcript levels were analyzed by using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Clinical data from 139 Ph(+) ALL patients who received allo-HSCT in our center were analyzed. Of these patients, 101 received HID transplants and 38 received MRD transplants. At a median follow-up of 36 months, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the HID transplant group were 65.8% and 74.0%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rates for the HID transplant group were 20.3% and 15.6%, respectively. In addition, there were no differences in OS, DFS, CIR, and NRM between the HID and MRD groups. Multivariate analysis showed that imatinib resistance was a significant factor influencing DFS and CIR in HID transplant patients. Haploidentical HSCT for the treatment of Ph(+) ALL achieves promising long-term survival, which is comparable with that of HLA-MRD HSCT.

However, the infection is still prevalent, and no effective treatment of the infection is known. By vaccinating persistently FeLV-infected cats and presenting FeLV antigens to the immune system of the host, e.g., in the form of recombinant and/or adjuvanted antigens, we intended to shift the balance toward an advantage of the host so that persistent infection could be overcome by the infected cat. Two commercially available FeLV vaccines efficacious in protecting naive cats from FeLV infection were tested in six experimentally and persistently FeLV-infected cats: first, a canarypox-vectored vaccine, and second, an adjuvanted, recombinant envelope vaccine was repeatedly administered with the aim to stimulate the immune system. No beneficial effects on p27 antigen and plasma viral RNA loads, anti-FeLV antibodies, or life expectancy of the cats were detected. The cats were unable to overcome or decrease viremia. Some cats developed antibodies to FeLV antigens although not protective. Thus, we cannot recommend vaccinating persistently FeLV-infected cats as a means of improving their FeLV status, quality of life or life expectancy.

METHODS: ALL cases were diagnosed between 1992 and 1994 and information on family characteristics was collected during a previously conducted nationwide case-control study. Children were followed for 10 years after diagnosis, as few disease-related events occur afterwards. Cox proportional hazards models estimating hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using overall as well as event-free survival methods. RESULTS: Second born children showed statistically significant better survival compared to first or later born children, with HRs ranging between 0.54 and 0.64 compared to firstborns. Somewhat poorer survival was observed for children having 3 or more siblings. A relationship was found for parental age at child's diagnosis, with poorer survival for children with younger parents (</=25 years of age at child's diagnosis), or with older fathers. The HR was statistically significant for fathers being >/=41years of age (HR of 2.1). No relationship between degree of urbanization of the place of residence at diagnosis and ALL survival was observed. CONCLUSION: Family circumstances may have an impact on survival from childhood ALL in Germany. Further research is warranted to elaborate the relationship of specific family characteristics and ALL survival and to investigate possible differential adherence to therapy and interactions with physicians.","['Erdmann, Friederike', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Erdmann F', 'Kaatsch P', 'Schuz J']","['Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon, France.

However, serious infectious complications frequently occur after treatment. The reason for increased infections postalemtuzumab treatment is unknown at this stage. We explore the effect of alemtuzumab on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and intestinal barrier function in cynomolgus model to explain the reason of infection following alemtuzumab treatment. METHODS: Twelve male cynomolguses were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. The treatment group received alemtuzumab (3 mg/kg, intravenous injection) while the control group received the same volume of physiological saline. Intestinal IELs were isolated from the control group and the treatment group (on day 9, 35, and 70 after treatment) for counting and flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, intestinal permeability was monitored by enzymatic spectrophotometric technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The numbers of IELs were decreased significantly on day 9 after treatment compared with the control group (0.35 +/- 0.07 x 10 8 and 1.35 +/- 0.09 x 10 8 , respectively; P < 0.05) and were not fully restored until day 70 after treatment. There were significant differences among four groups considering IELs subtypes. In addition, the proportion of apoptotic IELs after alemtuzumab treatment was significantly higher than in the control group (22.01 +/- 3.67 and 6.01 +/- 1.42, respectively; P < 0.05). Moreover, the concentration of D-lactate and endotoxin was also increased significantly on day 9 after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab treatment depletes lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and intestine of cynomolgus model. The induction of apoptosis is an important mechanism of lymphocyte depletion after alemtuzumab treatment. Notably, intestinal barrier function may be disrupted after alemtuzumab treatment.","['Qu, Lin-Lin', 'Lyu, Ya-Qing', 'Jiang, Hai-Tao', 'Shan, Ting', 'Zhang, Jing-Bin', 'Li, Qiu-Rong', 'Li, Jie-Shou']","['Qu LL', 'Lyu YQ', 'Jiang HT', 'Shan T', 'Zhang JB', 'Li QR', 'Li JS']","['Department of General Surgery, Institute of General Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Intestines/*cytology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission']",PMC4834783,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2015_128_5_680_151675 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.151675 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2015 Mar 5;128(5):680-6. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.151675.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical data from 1383 patients with NKTCL treated at 10 participating institutions between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. A nomogram was developed that predicted overall survival (OS) based on the Cox proportional hazards model. To contrast the utility of the nomogram against the widely used Ann Arbor staging system, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and the Korean Prognostic Index (KPI), we used the concordance index (C-index) and a calibration curve to determine its predictive and discriminatory capacity. The 5-year OS rate was 60.3% for the entire group. The nomogram included five important variables based on a multivariate analysis of the primary cohort: stage; age; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; lactate dehydrogenase; and primary tumor invasion. The calibration curve showed that the nomogram was able to predict 5-year OS accurately. The C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction was 0.72 for both cohorts, which was superior to the predictive power (range, 0.56-0.64) of the Ann Arbor stage, IPI and KPI in the primary and validation cohorts. The proposed nomogram provides an individualized risk estimate of OS in patients with NKTCL.","['Yang, Y', 'Zhang, Y-J', 'Zhu, Y', 'Cao, J-Z', 'Yuan, Z-Y', 'Xu, L-M', 'Wu, J-X', 'Wang, W', 'Wu, T', 'Lu, B', 'Zhu, S-Y', 'Qian, L-T', 'Zhang, F-Q', 'Hou, X-R', 'Liu, Q-F', 'Li, Y-X']","['Yang Y', 'Zhang YJ', 'Zhu Y', 'Cao JZ', 'Yuan ZY', 'Xu LM', 'Wu JX', 'Wang W', 'Wu T', 'Lu B', 'Zhu SY', 'Qian LT', 'Zhang FQ', 'Hou XR', 'Liu QF', 'Li YX']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital and Institute, Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanxi Cancer Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, People's Republic of China."", ""Guizhou Cancer Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guizhou Cancer Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Cancer Hospital and the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital and Institute, Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital and Institute, Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20150220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Nomograms', 'Nose Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201544 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.44 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1571-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.44.

Aa and Ap reduced the viability of AML cells in a dose dependent manner with IC50 of 10-20 microM. Ap triggered apoptotic cell death more efficiently than Aa. Both alkaloids increased the protein level of S139-phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX), which however was independent of the induction of DNA damage. Expression of the senescence markers p21 and p16 was increased, while the phosphorylation level of p-Chk-2 was reduced following Aa treatment. As a function of dose, Aa and Ap protected or sensitized AML cells against daunorubicin. Protection by Aa was paralleled by reduced formation of ROS and lower level of DNA damage. Both Aa and Ap attenuated daunorubicin-stimulated activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) as reflected on the levels of gammaH2AX, p-Kap-1 and p-Chk-1. Specifically Ap restored the decrease in S10 phosphorylation of histone H3 resulting from daunorubicin treatment. The cytoprotective effects of Aa and Ap were independent of daunorubicin import/export. Both Aa and Ap abrogated daunorubicin-induced accumulation of cells in S-phase. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was specific for Ap. The data show that Aa and Ap have both congruent and agent-specific pleiotropic effects that are preferential for anticancer drugs. Since Ap showed a broader spectrum of anticancer activities, this compound is suggested as novel lead compound for forthcoming in vivo studies elucidating the usefulness of spongean alkaloids in AML therapy.","['Stuhldreier, Fabian', 'Kassel, Stefanie', 'Schumacher, Lena', 'Wesselborg, Sebastian', 'Proksch, Peter', 'Fritz, Gerhard']","['Stuhldreier F', 'Kassel S', 'Schumacher L', 'Wesselborg S', 'Proksch P', 'Fritz G']","['Institute of Toxicology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany; Institute of Molecular Medicine I, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.', 'Institute of Toxicology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany; Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Universitatsstrasse 1, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.', 'Institute of Toxicology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine I, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Universitatsstrasse 1, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.', 'Institute of Toxicology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been shown to be typical of many neoplasms. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cells carrying the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and an oncogenic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase fusion gene. While the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib has revolutionized treatment of CML, it has become increasingly clear in recent years that TKI treatment alone will not be curative in many cases. Thus, further dissection of the regulatory networks that drive BCR-ABL-induced malignant transformation may help to identify other novel therapeutic approaches that complement TKI treatment. In this study we demonstrate that the expression of miR-424 is markedly low in CML cell lines and patient samples at time of diagnosis. With the aid of bioinformatics analysis we revealed a conserved target site for miR-424 in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the ABL gene. Via luciferase assays, we showed that miR-424 directly targets BCR-ABL. Overexpression of miR-424 was shown to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of K562 cells as well as sensitize these cells to imatinib treatment. These findings strongly suggest that miR-424 acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating BCR-ABL expression. Up-regulation of miR-424 in CML cells may therefore have a therapeutic effect against this disease.","['Hershkovitz-Rokah, Oshrat', 'Modai, Shira', 'Pasmanik-Chor, Metsada', 'Toren, Amos', 'Shomron, Noam', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Granot, Galit']","['Hershkovitz-Rokah O', 'Modai S', 'Pasmanik-Chor M', 'Toren A', 'Shomron N', 'Raanani P', 'Shpilberg O', 'Granot G']","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Safra Children's Hospital, Tel-Hashomer, Israel."", 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel; Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Assuta Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.

FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines have been shown to generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). However, the molecular basis of how FLT3-ITD-driven ROS leads to the aggressive form of AML is not clearly understood. Our group has previously reported that inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling results in post-translational down-regulation of p22(phox), a small membrane-bound subunit of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex. Here we demonstrated that 32D cells, a myeloblast-like cell line transfected with FLT3-ITD, have a higher protein level of p22(phox) and p22(phox)-interacting NOX isoforms than 32D cells transfected with the wild type FLT3 receptor (FLT3-WT). The inhibition of NOX proteins, p22(phox), and NOX protein knockdowns caused a reduction in ROS, as measured with a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-specific dye, peroxy orange 1 (PO1), and nuclear H2O2, as measured with nuclear peroxy emerald 1 (NucPE1). These reductions in the level of H2O2 following the NOX knockdowns were accompanied by a decrease in the number of DNA DSBs. We showed that 32D cells that express FLT3-ITD have a higher level of both oxidized DNA and DNA DSBs than their wild type counterparts. We also observed that NOX4 and p22(phox) localize to the nuclear membrane in MV4-11 cells expressing FLT3-ITD.

Understanding metabolic alterations associated with drug resistance opens up unexplored opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here, we applied a broad spectrum of technologies including RNA sequencing, global untargeted metabolomics, and stable isotope labeling mass spectrometry to identify metabolic changes in P-glycoprotein overexpressing T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, which escaped a therapeutically relevant daunorubicin treatment. We show that compared with sensitive ALL cells, resistant leukemia cells possess a fundamentally rewired central metabolism characterized by reduced dependence on glutamine despite a lack of expression of glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL), a higher demand for glucose and an altered rate of fatty acid beta-oxidation, accompanied by a decreased pantothenic acid uptake capacity. We experimentally validate our findings by selectively targeting components of this metabolic switch, using approved drugs and starvation approaches followed by cell viability analyses in both the ALL cells and in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) sensitive/resistant cell line pair. We demonstrate how comparative metabolomics and RNA expression profiling of drug-sensitive and -resistant cells expose targetable metabolic changes and potential resistance markers. Our results show that drug resistance is associated with significant metabolic costs in cancer cells, which could be exploited using new therapeutic strategies.","['Staubert, Claudia', 'Bhuiyan, Hasanuzzaman', 'Lindahl, Anna', 'Broom, Oliver Jay', 'Zhu, Yafeng', 'Islam, Saiful', 'Linnarsson, Sten', 'Lehtio, Janne', 'Nordstrom, Anders']","['Staubert C', 'Bhuiyan H', 'Lindahl A', 'Broom OJ', 'Zhu Y', 'Islam S', 'Linnarsson S', 'Lehtio J', 'Nordstrom A']","['From the Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, 90187 Umea, Sweden, the Department of Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, 90183 Umea, Sweden, the Institute of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden, and.', 'Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden, and.', 'From the Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, 90187 Umea, Sweden.', 'Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden, and.', 'the Departments of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics and.', 'the Departments of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics and.', 'Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden, and.', 'From the Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, 90187 Umea, Sweden, the Department of Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, 90183 Umea, Sweden, Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden, and anders.nordstrom@molbiol.umu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150219,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fatty acid oxidation complex)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '19F5HK2737 (Pantothenic Acid)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 2.3.1.16 (Acetyl-CoA C-Acyltransferase)', 'EC 4.2.1.17 (Enoyl-CoA Hydratase)', 'EC 5.1.- (Racemases and Epimerases)', 'EC 5.3.3.- (Carbon-Carbon Double Bond Isomerases)', 'KU65374X44 (Perhexiline)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acetyl-CoA C-Acyltransferase/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carbon-Carbon Double Bond Isomerases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enoyl-CoA Hydratase/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/biosynthesis', 'Glutamine/*physiology', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Metabolome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pantothenic Acid/metabolism', 'Perhexiline/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Racemases and Epimerases/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",PMC4375488,2015/02/24 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2015/02/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)63978-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.618769 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 27;290(13):8348-59. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.618769.

These culture-differentiated cells constitutively express toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and release interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-10. We show the TLR4-ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulate the TLR and up-regulate IFN-gamma skewing the cells towards type 1 polarization. In presence of LPS these cells also express suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 and thus suppress IL-10 expression. In contrast, heat shock protein (Hsp)70 down-regulated TLR4 augmenting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In association with IL-10 release IFN-gamma was abrogated. The programmed cell death (PD)-1 mostly present in regulatory T cells was stimulated in these IL-10 producing cells by Hsp70 and not LPS indicating the cells can be driven to two contrast outcomes by the two TLR4 ligands.

Despite the great promise initially envisioned for DLI as a method to augment GVL after transplantation, it utility is limited by low response rates in diseases other than chronic myelogenous leukemia and by the development of GVHD, the principal complication of DLI. To maximize GVL potency while minimizing toxicity, cellular effectors active in GVL need to be elucidated. Insight into mechanisms of GVL, such as reversal of in situ T-cell exhaustion, may allow identification of patients who will respond to DLI based on the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the BM. Understanding the clinical factors that influence the effectiveness and abrogate the toxicity of DLI, such as cell dose and timing of DLI after transplantation, will allow further optimization of DLI. This chapter reviews novel strategies that maximize the GVL effect of DLI by enhancing activity while limiting toxicity.","['Nikiforow, Sarah', 'Alyea, Edwin P']","['Nikiforow S', 'Alyea EP']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

These symptoms are thought to occur because of blast aggregates and WBC thrombi in the circulation, which reduce blood flow. Leukostasis may cause various complications, including hyperviscosity syndrome, vascular occlusion resulting in intracranial hemorrhages and respiratory failure, and perivascular leukemic infiltrates. Leukostasis occurs more commonly with a high WBC count and with leukemias of monocytoid lineage such as acute myelomonocytic leukemia, which is a reflection of the nature of the leukemic blasts. Leukocytapheresis is used in an effort to quickly decrease a patient's circulating blast count, which can both prevent the development of leukostasis and provide symptomatic relief of leukostasis. However, the impact of leukocytapheresis on early- and long-term mortality is controversial, with several studies producing conflicting results. In this chapter, the pathophysiology of leukostasis, performance of leukocytapheresis, and efficacy of this treatment are reviewed.","['Aqui, Nicole', ""O'Doherty, Una""]","['Aqui N', ""O'Doherty U""]","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future.

Ruxolitinib has shown success in alleviating the symptomatic burden, reducing splenomegaly and improving quality of life in patients with MF. The role and clinical expectations of JAK2 inhibition continues to expand to a variety of investigational arenas. Clinical trials for patients with MF focus on new JAK inhibitors with potentially less myelosuppression (pacritinib) or even activity for anemia (momelotinib). Further efforts focus on combination trials (including a JAK inhibitor base) or targeting new pathways (ie, telomerase). Similarly, therapy for PV continues to evolve with phase 3 trials investigating optimal frontline therapy (hydroxyurea or IFN) and second-line therapy for hydroxyurea-refractory or intolerant PV with JAK inhibitors.

This applies to the treatment of de novo and recurrent ALL. In high-risk ALL, MRD detection is considered an important tool to adjust therapy before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Precise quantification and quality control is instrumental to avoid false treatment assignment. A new methodological approach to analyzing MRD has become available and is based on next-generation sequencing. In principle, this technique will be able to detect a large number of leukemic subclones at a much higher speed than before. Carefully designed prospective studies need to demonstrate concordance or even superiority compared with those techniques in use right now: detection of aberrant expression of leukemia-specific antigens by flow cytometry of blood or bone marrow, or detection of specific rearrangements of the T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction using DNA of leukemic cells. In some cases with known fusion genes, such as BCR/ABL, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction has been used as additional method to identify leukemic cells by analyzing RNA in patient samples. MRD detection may be used to modulate treatment intensity once it has been demonstrated at well-defined informative checkpoints that certain levels of MRD can reliably predict the risk of relapse. In addition, MRD is used as end point to determine the activity of a given agent or treatment protocol. If activity translates into antileukemic efficacy, MRD may be considered a surrogate clinical end point.","['Schrappe, Martin']",['Schrappe M'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Deep molecular remissions are likely in most chronic phase patients and expectations on timing of response have been developed, validated as best as possible, and evolved over time. Increasing attention has been given to the initial decline of Bcr-Abl1 transcripts and the ultimate depth of molecular remission, overshadowing but not displacing the traditional role of cytogenetic response. This chapter reviews the evolution of response milestones for chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia and tries to answer the question of how little disease is too much.","['Mauro, Michael J']",['Mauro MJ'],"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Although it has become apparent that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level, the standard framework for risk stratification guiding transplant practice in this disease remains largely based on pretreatment assessment of cytogenetics and a limited panel of molecular genetic markers, coupled with morphological assessment of bone marrow (BM) blast percentage after induction. However, application of more objective methodology such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has highlighted the limitations of morphology for reliable determination of remission status. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that detection of subclinical levels of leukemia (ie, minimal residual disease, MRD) using MFC or molecular-based approaches provides powerful independent prognostic information. Consequently, there is increasing interest in the use of MRD detection to provide early end points in clinical trials and to inform patient management. However, implementation of MRD assessment into clinical practice remains a major challenge, hampered by differences in the assays and preferred analytical methods employed between routine laboratories. Although this should be addressed through adoption of standardized assays with external quality control, it is clear that the molecular heterogeneity of AML coupled with increasing understanding of its clonal architecture dictates that a ""one size fits all"" approach to MRD detection in this disease is not feasible. However, with the range of platforms now available, there is considerable scope to realistically track treatment response in every patient.","['Grimwade, David', 'Freeman, Sylvie D']","['Grimwade D', 'Freeman SD']","[""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom; and."", 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Birmingham Medical School, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

With this success has come increasing recognition of the adverse late effects of treatment. The significant long-term sequelae in the earliest cohort of long-term survivors treated in the 1970s and 1980s are well documented. To reduce the incidence of these late effects, the majority of pediatric patients treated on more contemporary regimens receive less intensive treatment than did those treated 30-40 years ago. However, current therapies are not risk free; children treated with contemporary regimens remain at risk for developing long-term toxicities, including cardiac dysfunction, osteonecrosis, neurocognitive impairment, and second malignant neoplasms. One of the great challenges facing clinical investigators today is to identify interventions that will reduce the frequency and severity of long-term toxicities without adversely affecting cure rates. The use of dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant (to prevent anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity) and alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone (to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis) are examples of 2 such successful strategies. This article provides an overview of the long-term toxicities associated with current therapies and reviews results of clinical trials designed to minimize the burden of cure in long-term survivors.","['Silverman, Lewis B']",['Silverman LB'],"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In CLL, functional studies have implicated BCR activation in the tissue microenvironment as a pivotal pathway in the pathogenesis.

These can be evaluated by clinically available methods such as fluorescent in situ hybridization and targeted sequencing approaches to provide data that can be very helpful in prognostication and planning of treatment. Acquired defects in the p53 pathway, activating mutations of NOTCH1, and dysfunctional mutations of SF3B1 and BIRC3 identify patients with higher risk of progressive disease, poorer responses to conventional chemoimmunotherapy, and shorter survival. Risk stratification using these data can identify patients with aggressive CLL who require careful monitoring and are unlikely to have durable responses to chemoimmunotherapy at disease progression. Patients with defective DNA damage repair mechanisms because of p53 dysfunction should be considered for non-chemotherapy-based regimens including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and immunological therapies including allogeneic transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor-targeted T cells. Conversely, patients with no high-risk mutations can usually be monitored for a prolonged time and are likely to have durable responses to chemoimmunotherapy at disease progression.

However, at present, only the markers NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 have entered clinical practice. Treatment of intermediate-risk AML patients eligible for intensive therapy has not changed substantially. The ""3 + 7"" induction therapy still represents the standard of care. The addition of the immunoconjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin to therapy has been shown to improve outcome; however, the drug is not approved for this use. A common standard for postremission therapy is the administration of repeated cycles of intermediate- to high-dose cytarabine. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may offer a survival benefit for many patients with intermediate-risk AML.

Patients >/=60 years of age continue to have poor prognosis. Preliminary results suggest benefit from reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in selected patients 60-80 years of age. However, although patients in this age range comprise >50% of those with AML, they currently constitute only 17% of those offered HCT. In the absence of prospective randomized studies comparing HCT and chemotherapy, the decision to recommend HCT rests on retrospective analyses of the risks of relapse and nonrelapse mortality after each approach. There is strong evidence that pre-HCT comorbidities can predict HCT-related morbidity and mortality. Age alone does not appear predictive and, particularly if the risk of relapse with chemotherapy is high, should not be the sole basis for deciding against HCT. Use of geriatric assessment tools, inflammatory biomarkers, and genetic polymorphism data may further aid in predicting nonrelapse mortality after HCT. Disease status and pretreatment cytogenetics with FLT3-TID, NPM-1, and CEBP-alpha status are the main factors predicting relapse and these are likely to be supplemented by incorporation of other molecular markers and the level of minimal residual disease after chemotherapy. HLA-matched related and unrelated donor grafts seem preferable to those from other donor sources. Donor age is of no clear significance. Models combining comorbidities with AML risk factors are useful in risk assessment before HCT. In this chapter, we integrated information on AML-specific, HCT-specific, and patient-specific risk factors into a risk-adapted approach to guide decisions about HCT versus no HCT.","['Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Sorror ML', 'Estey E']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In the past, only a third of older patients (defined as individuals older than 60-65 years of age) with AML received definitive therapy for their disease due to concerns about their overall fitness and potential treatment-related mortality. However, compelling epidemiological data have shown unequivocally that older AML patients up to 80 years old both tolerate and survive longer after therapy than their untreated counterparts. Current therapeutic options for elderly individuals with AML include intensive chemotherapy with a cytarabine and anthracycline backbone, hypomethylating agents (decitabine and azacitidine), low-dose cytarabine, investigational agents, and supportive care with hydroxyurea and transfusions. Over the last few years, there has been increasing debate regarding the appropriate therapeutic approach to take in older adults given the diversity of the geriatric patient population and heterogeneous AML disease biology. This article discusses how performance status, comorbidities, disease characteristics, quality of life concerns, and long-term treatment goals affect the selection of appropriate therapy for older adults with AML. Risks and benefits of each treatment approach based on the most recent medical literature are discussed. Finally, a treatment algorithm summarizing these data and incorporating geriatric assessment and molecular and cytogenetic markers predictive of therapeutic response is proposed to aid in the clinical decision-making process.","['Wang, Eunice S']",['Wang ES'],"['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20141118,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The objective of this study was to investigate the antineoplastic activity of PB, an antineoplastic nutrient mixture (containing quercetin, curcumin, green tea, cruciferex and resveratrol) on human FA HNSCC in vitro and in vivo. Human FA HNSCC cell line OHSU-974 (Fanconi Anemia Research Fund) was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% FBS and anti-biotics. At near confluence, cells were treated in triplicate with different concentrations of PB: 0, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 microg/ml. Cells were also treated with PMA to induce MMP-9 activity. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, secretion of MMPs by gelatinase zymography, invasion through Matrigel, migration by scratch test and morphology by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In vivo, athymic male nude mice (n=12) were inoculated with 3x106 OHSU-974 cells subcutaneously and randomly divided into two groups: group A was fed a regular diet and group B a regular diet supplemented with 1% PB. Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed and their tumors were excised, weighed and processed for histology. NM inhibited the growth of OHSU-974 tumor by 67.6% (p<0.0001) and tumor burden by 63.6% (p<0.0001). PB demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, with 27% (p=0.0003) and 48% (p=0.0004) toxicity at 75 and 100 microg/ml, respectively. Zymography revealed MMP-2 and PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion. PB suppressed secretion of both MMPs in a dose-dependent manner, with total block of both at 50 microg/ml. PB inhibited cell migration (by scratch test) and OHSU-974 invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent fashion with total block at 50 microg/ml. H&E staining showed no morphological changes below 50 microg/ml.

Herein, we observe that such HCEC monolayers continue to expand and retain a normal phenotype for 2 more weeks if cultured in a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-containing serum-free medium. Such expansion is accompanied initially by upregulation of Cyclin E2 colocalized with nuclear translocation of phosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (p-Rb) at Day 21 followed by a delay in contact inhibition through activation of LIF-Janus kinase1 (JAK1)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling at Day 35. The LIF-JAK1-STAT3 signaling is coupled with upregulation of E2F2 colocalized with nuclear p-Rb and with concomitant downregulation of p16(INK4a), of which upregulation is linked to senescence. Hence, activation of LIF-JAK1-STAT3 signaling to delay contact inhibition can be used as another strategy to facilitate engineering of HCEC grafts to solve the unmet global shortage of corneal grafts.","['Liu, Xin', 'Tseng, Scheffer C G', 'Zhang, Ming-Chang', 'Chen, Szu-Yu', 'Tighe, Sean', 'Lu, Wen-Juan', 'Zhu, Ying-Ting']","['Liu X', 'Tseng SC', 'Zhang MC', 'Chen SY', 'Tighe S', 'Lu WJ', 'Zhu YT']","['a Department of Ophthalmology; Union Hospital; Tongji Medical College ; Huazhong University of Science and Technology ; Wuhan , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (E2F2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Contact Inhibition/drug effects', 'Cornea/*cytology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'E2F2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC4613548,2015/02/20 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1013667 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(8):1197-206. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1013667.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BMP, bone morphogenetic protein', 'BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine', 'CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase', 'CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors', ""DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium"", 'E2F2', 'EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid', 'EGF, epidermal growth factor', 'EMT, endothelial mesenchymal transition', 'ESC, embryonic stem cell', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase', ""HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution"", 'HCEC, human corneal endothelial cell', 'ID, inhibitor of differentiation', 'ITS, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite', 'JAK, Janus kinase', 'JAK1', 'LEF1, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1', 'LIF', 'LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor', 'MESCM, modified embryonic stem cell medium', 'NC, neural crest', 'NFkB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells', 'PBS, phosphate-buffered saline', 'RPE, retinal pigment epithelial cells', 'Rb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor', 'SHEM, supplemental hormonal epithelial medium', 'STAT3', 'STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3', 'ZO-1, Zona occludens protein 1', 'bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor', 'contact inhibition', 'corneal endothelium', 'iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells', 'p120, p120 catenin', 'p16INK4a', 'proliferation', 'scRNA, scramble RNA', 'siRNA, small interfering ribonucleic acid']","['R44 EY022502/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 EY 022502-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 EY 022502-02/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because flow-based MRD tests are developed in the laboratory, testing methodologies and lower levels of detection (LODs) are laboratory dependent. OBJECTIVES: To broadly survey flow cytometry laboratories about MRD testing in laboratories, if performed, including indications and reported LODs. DESIGN: Voluntary supplemental questions were sent to the 549 laboratories participating in the College of American Pathologists (CAP) FL3-A Survey (Flow Cytometry-Immunophenotypic Characterization of Leukemia/Lymphoma) in the spring of 2014. RESULTS: A total of 500 laboratories (91%) responded to the supplemental questions as part of the FL3-A Survey by April 2014; of those 500 laboratories, 167 (33%) currently perform MRD for lymphoblastic leukemia, 118 (24%) for myeloid leukemia, 99 (20%) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 91 (18%) for plasma cell myeloma. Other indications include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, neuroblastoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Most responding laboratories that perform MRD for lymphoblastic leukemia reported an LOD of 0.01%. For myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and plasma cell myeloma, most laboratories indicated an LOD of 0.1%. Less than 3% (15 of 500) of laboratories reported LODs of 0.001% for one or more MRD assays performed. CONCLUSIONS: There is major heterogeneity in the reported LODs of MRD testing performed by laboratories subscribing to the CAP FL3-A Survey. To address that heterogeneity, changes to the Flow Cytometry Checklist for the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program are suggested that will include new requirements that each laboratory (1) document how an MRD assay's LOD is measured, and (2) include the LOD or lower limit of enumeration for flow-based MRD assays in the final diagnostic report.","['Keeney, Michael', 'Halley, Jaimie G', 'Rhoads, Daniel D', 'Ansari, M Qasim', 'Kussick, Steven J', 'Karlon, William J', 'Mehta, Kumudini U', 'Dorfman, David M', 'Linden, Michael A']","['Keeney M', 'Halley JG', 'Rhoads DD', 'Ansari MQ', 'Kussick SJ', 'Karlon WJ', 'Mehta KU', 'Dorfman DM', 'Linden MA']","[""From the Department of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada (Mr Keeney); the Department of Surveys, College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois (Ms Halley); the Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Dr Rhoads); the Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio (Dr Ansari); PhenoPath, Seattle, Washington (Dr Kussick); the Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (Dr Karlon); Quest Diagnostics, Teterboro, New Jersey (Dr Mehta); the Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (Dr Dorfman); and the Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (Dr Linden).""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150219,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Laboratories/standards', 'Laboratory Proficiency Testing/methods/standards', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Pathology, Clinical/methods/standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies, Medical', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",,2015/02/20 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2014-0543-CP [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2015 Oct;139(10):1276-80. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2014-0543-CP.

However, the effect of KML001 has not been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigated the anti-leukemic effect of KML001 in AML, and determined the mode of action of KML001. KML001 inhibited the cellular proliferation in all AML cell lines and primary AML blasts as well as HL-60R (cytosine arabinoside-resistant HL-60) cells, while As2O3 was not effective in primary AML blasts and AML cell lines including HL-60R cells. KML001 induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in HL-60 and HL-60R cells. KML001 inhibited the activation of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 1, 3, 5, NF-kappaB, AKT and PI3K, while phosphorylated PTEN was upregulated. In addition, activation of ERK, p38 and JNK was observed in KML001-induced growth inhibition of HL-60 and HL-60R cells. Furthermore, KML001 induced telomeric terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length shortening in a time-dependent manner in HL-60 and HL-60R cells. Realtime PCR with RNA extracted from KML001-treated HL-60 and HL-60R cells showed a significant reduction of catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, gamma-H2AX, a sensitive molecular marker of DNA damage, in HL-60 and HL-60R cells was induced by KML001. These results suggest that KML001 inhibits the proliferation of AML cells including cytosine arabinoside-resistant AML cells via various mechanisms such as cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of JAK/STAT and PI3K pathways, activation of MAPK pathway and telomere targeting.","['Yoon, Jin Sun', 'Kim, Eun Shil', 'Park, Byeong Bae', 'Choi, Jung Hye', 'Won, Young Woong', 'Kim, Sujong', 'Lee, Young Yiul']","['Yoon JS', 'Kim ES', 'Park BB', 'Choi JH', 'Won YW', 'Kim S', 'Lee YY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Pharmaceutical Division, Komipharm International Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150217,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Arsenites/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sodium Compounds/*therapeutic use']",,2015/02/20 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.2899 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 May;46(5):1953-62. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.2899.

However, it is difficult to predict the role of the ligands in each patient. Here, we report an analysis of the mechanism of resistance behind crizotinib resistance using a primary culture of cancer cells from pleural effusion of an anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer patient who was clinically resistant to crizotinib. METHODS: Primary cancer cells were prepared as cancer tissue-originated spheroids (CTOSs) according to previously described methods. CTOSs were maintained in StemPro medium, and a sensitivity assay was performed under growth factor-free conditions, or under stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or neuregulin-1/heregulin. The effect of treatment with crizotinib alone or a combination of crizotinib and erlotinib was examined. RESULTS: Cancer cells (LB53) were established to be CTOSs from a patient who was clinically resistant to crizotinib. The CTOSs were sensitive to crizotinib under growth factor-free conditions in vitro, whereas resistant under stimulation with EGF or neuregulin-1. These ligands rescued the inhibition of intracellular signaling by crizotinib. Pleural effusion from the patient also activated EGF receptor signaling to the similar extent of EGF stimulation. The resistance to crizotinib by EGF was reversed by blocking EGF receptor signaling by erlotinib in vitro. CONCLUSION: Stimulation by ERBB ligands is suggested to be responsible for resistance to crizotinib in this patient. The CTOS method may enable analysis of resistance mechanism for targeted therapy in individual patients.","['Kimura, Madoka', 'Endo, Hiroko', 'Inoue, Takako', 'Nishino, Kazumi', 'Uchida, Junji', 'Kumagai, Toru', 'Kukita, Yoji', 'Kato, Kikuya', 'Imamura, Fumio', 'Inoue, Masahiro']","['Kimura M', 'Endo H', 'Inoue T', 'Nishino K', 'Uchida J', 'Kumagai T', 'Kukita Y', 'Kato K', 'Imamura F', 'Inoue M']","['*Departments of Thoracic Oncology, daggerBiochemistry, and double daggerMolecular and Medical Genetics, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (EML4-ALK fusion protein, human)', '0 (NRG1 protein, human)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '53AH36668S (Crizotinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Crizotinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuregulin-1/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2015/02/20 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0000000000000381 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31662-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2015 Mar;10(3):527-30. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0000000000000381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral transactivator Tax is regarded as the oncoprotein responsible for contributing toward the transformation process. Here, we demonstrate that Tax potently inhibits the activity of DEx(D/H) box helicases RIG-I and MDA5 as well as Toll-dependent TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF), which function as cellular sensors or mediators of viral RNA and facilitate innate immune responses, including the production of type I IFN. Tax manifested this function by binding to the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains of TRIF and RIP1 to disrupt interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activity, a critical type I IFN transcription factor. These data provide further mechanistic insight into HTLV-1-mediated subversion of cellular host defense responses, which may help explain HTLV-1-related pathogenesis and oncogenesis. IMPORTANCE: It is predicted that up to 15% of all human cancers may involve virus infection. For example, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been reported to infect up to 25 million people worldwide and is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We show here that HTLV-1 may be able to successfully infect the T cells and remain latent due to the virally encoded product Tax inhibiting a key host defense pathway. Understanding the mechanisms by which Tax subverts the immune system may lead to the development of a therapeutic treatment for HTLV-1-mediated disease.","['Hyun, Jinhee', 'Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Toomey, Ngoc', 'Balachandran, Siddharth', 'Lavorgna, Alfonso', 'Harhaj, Edward', 'Barber, Glen N']","['Hyun J', 'Ramos JC', 'Toomey N', 'Balachandran S', 'Lavorgna A', 'Harhaj E', 'Barber GN']","['Department of Cell Biology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA gbarber@med.miami.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150218,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Immune Evasion', '*Immune Tolerance', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC4403453,2015/02/20 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02493-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02493-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 May;89(9):4880-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02493-14.

METHODS: We extended follow-up to December 2012 for 8036 men employed at five factories in the UK which had manufactured phenoxy herbicides, or in a contract spraying business. Mortality was compared with that for England and Wales by the person-years method. Nested case-control analyses compared men with incident or fatal STS (n=15) or NHL/CLL (n=74) and matched controls (up to 10 per case). RESULTS: 4093 men had died, including 2303 since the last follow-up. Mortality from all causes and all cancers was close to expectation, but an excess of deaths from NHL was observed among men who had worked for >/=1 year in jobs with more than background exposure to phenoxy herbicides (19 deaths, SMR 1.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.89). Four deaths from STS occurred among men potentially exposed above background (3.3 expected). In the nested case-control analyses, there were no significantly elevated risks or consistent trends across categories of potential exposure for either STS or NHL/CLL. Among men who had worked for >/=1 year in potentially exposed jobs, the highest OR (for STS) was only 1.30 (95% CI 0.30 to 5.62). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the current balance of epidemiological evidence. If phenoxy herbicides pose a hazard of either STS or NHL, then any absolute increase in risk is likely to be small.","['Coggon, David', 'Ntani, Georgia', 'Harris, E Clare', 'Jayakody, Nimeshi', 'Palmer, Keith T']","['Coggon D', 'Ntani G', 'Harris EC', 'Jayakody N', 'Palmer KT']","['MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150218,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Phenols)', '3229-70-7 (phenoxy radical)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herbicides/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Phenols/toxicity', 'Sarcoma/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC4445603,2015/02/20 06:00,2015/07/18 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2014-102654 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2014-102654 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2015 Jun;72(6):435-41. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2014-102654.

The reasons for the unimpressive results of most clinical studies of the therapeutic effects of VDDs in leukemia and related diseases may include the lack of a precise rationale for the conduct of these studies. Further, clinical trials to date have generally used extremely heterogeneous patient populations and, in many cases, small numbers of patients, generally without controls. Although low calcemic VDDs have been used and combined with agents that can increase the leukemia cell killing or differentiation effects in acute leukemias, the sequencing of agents used for combination therapy should to be more clearly delineated. Most importantly, it is recommended that in future clinical trials the rationale for the basis of the enhancing action of drug combinations should be clearly articulated and the effects on anticancer immunity should also be evaluated.","['Studzinski, George P', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Sarkar, Surojit', 'Kalia, Vandana', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Studzinski GP', 'Harrison JS', 'Wang X', 'Sarkar S', 'Kalia V', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers, NJ Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, New Jersey 07103.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Missouri Medical School, One Hospital Drive, Columbia, Missouri 65212.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers, NJ Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, New Jersey 07103.', 'The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', 'The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.

Although the improvements in survival outcome have been clearly addressed by clinical trials, these studies includes patients who are otherwise healthy and would be eligible for trials that the actual improvement in survival in the general patient population over time is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we reviewed the cancer-registry data of patients with lymphoma and myeloma in Japan from 1993 to 2006 and estimated relative survival (adjusted for competing causes of death in same-age members of the general population) according to three periods of diagnosis (1993-1997, 1998-2002 and 2003-2006). We also estimated conditional 5-year relative survival (5-year survival rate of patients who have survived 5 years). A total of 26,141 patients were reviewed and analyzed. Relative survival improved in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, N = 853, +20% improvement), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, N = 4,919, +14% improvement) and follicular lymphoma (FL, N = 1,333, +13% improvement).

Several other effects of the drug have been studied in vitro, such as the alterations of some enzymes, the inhibition of cell proliferation, and the increase of transferrin receptor expression. In this study, we investigated the alterations of protein kinase C (PKC) activity, PKCalpha and PKCbetaII expressions and plasmatic membrane fluidity induced by AZT in two cancer cell lines, human chronic myeloid (K562) and human acute lymphoblastic (HSB-2) leukemia cells, respectively. The results showed that both PKC activity and membrane fluidity in HSB-2 cells increased after 24 h of drug incubation. PKCalpha expression in HSB-2 cells decreased after 48 h of AZT exposure, when the cell growth also decreased. However, in K562 cells, the PKCalpha and PKCbetaII expressions enhanced in the presence of the drug when the growth was inhibited. The results indicate that AZT is less effective in inhibiting the growth of acute lymphoblastic HSB-2 leukemia cells than inhibiting that of chronic myeloid K562 cells. In fact, after 24 h exposure, the HSB-2 cell growth decreased less than K562 cell growth.","['Carnicelli, Veronica', 'Lizzi, Anna Rita', 'Gualtieri, Giancaterino', 'Bozzi, Argante', 'Franceschini, Nicola', 'Di Giulio, Antonio']","['Carnicelli V', 'Lizzi AR', 'Gualtieri G', 'Bozzi A', 'Franceschini N', 'Di Giulio A']","[""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila I-67100, Italy veronica.carnicelli@cc.univaq.it."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila I-67100, Italy."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila I-67100, Italy."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila I-67100, Italy."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila I-67100, Italy."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila I-67100, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150218,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C beta/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",,2015/02/20 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/02/20 06:00'],"['2015/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['gmv003 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmv003 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2015 Apr;47(4):278-84. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmv003.

METHODS: The outpatient treatment included induction with oral fludarabine, subcutaneous cytarabine and subcutaneous filgrastim (FAG). The patients received more induction cycles according to the response achieved. If there was no response to induction with FAG, the following induction cycle included oral idarubicin, subcutaneous cytarabine and subcutaneous filgrastim (IAG). Patients achieving CR received one intensification (FAG on response to previous FAG or alternatively IAG) and one consolidation cycle (IAG). RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled from April 2004 to June 2007. The median age was 73 yr (range 70-77). Fifteen patients (50%) achieved CR. The 2-yr DFS was 29% (95% CI, 5-47%), and the 2-yr OS was 23% (95% CI, 12-35%). Twenty-five of 69 cycles (36%) were managed on a completely outpatient basis. The median hospital stay per cycle was 10 d (95% CI, 3-25).

However, patients with hematologic malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia most often are above their fifties and are treated with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine how sexuality and HRQoL were affected in patients with hematologic malignancies at baseline compared with 1 month after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS: Data were collected twice with a longitudinal design using the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients responded. The importance of sexuality, sexual desire, and sexual ability decreased 1 month after treatment and distressing symptoms such as feelings of tiredness occurred more frequently compared with baseline. At the same time, improvement in global health status/quality of life as well as affected functions in HRQoL was reported. CONCLUSION: The findings are of significance for nurses in cancer care as these highlight that sexuality and HRQoL need to be considered also in older patients with hematologic malignancies when fertility issues are of less importance. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: To meet these patients' needs regarding sexuality and HRQoL, the care must provide greater consistency and continuity. One way is to organize the care in a patient-centered way where patients continuously meet a nurse guided by the idea of holistic individual nursing care throughout the care trajectory.","['Olsson, Cecilia', 'Sandin-Bojo, Ann-Kristin', 'Bjuresater, Kaisa', 'Larsson, Maria']","['Olsson C', 'Sandin-Bojo AK', 'Bjuresater K', 'Larsson M']","['Author Affiliations: Faculty of Health, Science and Technology, Department of Health Sciences, Karlstad University, Sweden (Ms Olsson and Drs Sandin-Bojo, Bjuresater, and Larsson); and the Women Department, The County Council of Varmland, Sweden (Dr Sandin-Bojo).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Fatigue/drug therapy/psychology', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Sexuality/*drug effects/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2015/02/19 06:00,2016/08/03 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000141 [doi]', '00002820-201503000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2015 Mar-Apr;38(2):99-110. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of malignancy in a postmarketing study of children exposed to pimecrolimus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal cohort study among a nationwide ongoing long-term cohort of children enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER) who had a history of atopic dermatitis and pimecrolimus use with data available up through May 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reports of malignancy among those in the PEER compared with expected rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. RESULTS: Overall, 7457 children were enrolled in the PEER, for a total of 26,792 person-years. Children used a mean (SD) of 793 (1356) g of pimecrolimus when enrolled in the study. As of May 2014, five malignancies had been reported. These include 2 leukemias, 1 osteosarcoma, and 2 lymphomas. No skin cancers were reported. The standardized incidence ratio for all malignancies (primary outcome) based on the age-standardized SEER population was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.5-2.8). As secondary analyses, the standardized incidence ratios (based on 2 cases for each) were 2.9 (95% CI, 0.7-11.7) for lymphoma and 2.0 (95% CI, 0.5-8.2) for leukemia. None of these findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on more than 25,000 person-years of follow-up, it seems unlikely that topical pimecrolimus as it was used in the PEER cohort to treat atopic dermatitis is associated with an increased risk of malignancy.","['Margolis, David J', 'Abuabara, Katrina', 'Hoffstad, Ole J', 'Wan, Joy', 'Raimondo, Denise', 'Bilker, Warren B']","['Margolis DJ', 'Abuabara K', 'Hoffstad OJ', 'Wan J', 'Raimondo D', 'Bilker WB']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia2Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.', 'Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Bridgewater, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Dermatol,JAMA dermatology,101589530,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '7KYV510875 (pimecrolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Administration, Cutaneous', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",PMC4465068,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/08/28 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['2119345 [pii]', '10.1001/jamadermatol.2014.4305 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Dermatol. 2015 Jun;151(6):594-9. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2014.4305.,,,,['T32 AR007465/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS665918'],['JAMA Dermatol. 2015 Jun;151(6):587-8.

We sought therefore to identify and characterize gene targets whose inhibition may improve RT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole genome pooled shRNA cytotoxicity screens were performed in A549 and NCI-H460 using a retroviral library of 74,705 sequences. Cells were propagated with or without daily radiation Monday-Friday. Radiosensitization by top differential dropout hits was assessed by clonogenic assays. Apoptosis was assessed using a caspase 3/7 cell-based activity assay and by annexin V-FITC and PI staining. MCL1 expression was assessed by qPCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: USP9X, a deubiquitinase, was a top hit among druggable gene products. WP1130, a small molecule USP9X inhibitor, showed synergistic cytotoxicity with IR. MCL1, an anti-apoptotic protein deubiquitinated by USP9X, decreased with USP9X inhibition and IR. This was accompanied by increases in caspase 3/7 activity and apoptosis. In a panel of NSCLC lines, MCL1 and USP9X protein and gene expression levels were highly correlated. Lines showing high levels of MCL1 expression were the most sensitive to USP9X inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of MCL1 expression as a predictive biomarker for USP9X inhibitors in NSCLC therapy.","['Kushwaha, Deepa', ""O'Leary, Colin"", 'Cron, Kyle R', 'Deraska, Peter', 'Zhu, Kaya', ""D'Andrea, Alan D"", 'Kozono, David']","['Kushwaha D', ""O'Leary C"", 'Cron KR', 'Deraska P', 'Zhu K', ""D'Andrea AD"", 'Kozono D']","['a Department of Radiation Oncology ; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ; Boston , MA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyanoacrylates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', '0 (degrasyn)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyanoacrylates/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage', 'Radiation', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC4622494,2015/02/19 06:00,2016/01/02 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2014.1002358 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(3):392-401. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2014.1002358.,,['NOTNLM'],"['DUB, deubiquitinase', 'IR, ionizing radiation', 'MCL1', 'NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer', 'RNAi screen', 'RT, radiotherapy', 'USP9X', 'apoptosis', 'lung cancer', 'radiosensitizing agents', 'shRNA, short hairpin RNA', 'siRNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA)']","['K08 CA172354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA172354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One possible cause is the high prevalence of gene rearrangements associated with the etiology or with a poor prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aims of this multicenter study were to determine the prevalence of the four most common gene rearrangements [ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, BCR-ABL1, and MLL rearrangements] and to explore their relationship with mortality rates during the first year of treatment in ALL children from Mexico City. Patients were recruited from eight public hospitals during 2010-2012. A total of 282 bone marrow samples were obtained at each child's diagnosis for screening by conventional and multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to determine the gene rearrangements. Gene rearrangements were detected in 50 (17.7%) patients. ETV6-RUNX1 was detected in 21 (7.4%) patients, TCF3-PBX1 in 20 (7.1%) patients, BCR-ABL1 in 5 (1.8%) patients, and MLL rearrangements in 4 (1.4%) patients. The earliest deaths occurred at months 1, 2, and 3 after diagnosis in patients with MLL, ETV6-RUNX1, and BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements, respectively. Gene rearrangements could be related to the aggressiveness of leukemia observed in Mexican children.","['Bekker-Mendez, Vilma Carolina', 'Miranda-Peralta, Enrique', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Olarte-Carrillo, Irma', 'Guerra-Castillo, Francisco Xavier', 'Pompa-Mera, Ericka Nelly', 'Ocana-Mondragon, Alicia', 'Rangel-Lopez, Angelica', 'Bernaldez-Rios, Roberto', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Amador-Sanchez, Raquel', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez, Jose Gabriel', 'de Diego Flores-Chapa, Jose', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, Arturo', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda, Maria Del Carmen', 'Dorantes-Acosta, Elisa Maria', 'Bolea-Murga, Victoria', 'Nunez-Villegas, Nancy', 'Velazquez-Avina, Martha Margarita', 'Torres-Nava, Jose Refugio', 'Reyes-Zepeda, Nancy Carolina', 'Gonzalez-Bonilla, Cesar', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel']","['Bekker-Mendez VC', 'Miranda-Peralta E', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Olarte-Carrillo I', 'Guerra-Castillo FX', 'Pompa-Mera EN', 'Ocana-Mondragon A', 'Rangel-Lopez A', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Amador-Sanchez R', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez JG', 'de Diego Flores-Chapa J', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda Mdel C', 'Dorantes-Acosta EM', 'Bolea-Murga V', 'Nunez-Villegas N', 'Velazquez-Avina MM', 'Torres-Nava JR', 'Reyes-Zepeda NC', 'Gonzalez-Bonilla C', 'Mejia-Arangure JM']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunologia e Infectologia, Hospital de Infectologia ""Dr. Daniel Mendez Hernandez"", ""La Raza"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Avenida Jacarandas Esquina Vallejo S/N colonia La Raza, 02990 Mexico, DF, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Hospital General de Mexico, Secretaria de Salud (SS), Eje 2A Sur (Dr. Balmis) 148, Col.

These health problems may limit physical performance and functional capacity, interfering with participation in work, social, and recreational activities. In this review, we discuss treatment-induced impairments in the endocrine, musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiopulmonary systems and their influence on mobility and physical function. We found that cranial radiation at a young age was associated with broad range of chronic conditions including obesity, short stature, low bone mineral density and neuromotor impairments. Anthracyclines and chest radiation are associated with both short and long-term cardiotoxicity. Although numerous chronic conditions are documented among individuals treated for childhood cancer, the impact of these conditions on mobility and function are not well characterized, with most studies limited to survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors. Moving forward, further research assessing the impact of chronic conditions on participation in work and social activities is required. Moreover, interventions to prevent or ameliorate the loss of physical function among children treated for cancer are likely to become an important area of survivorship research.","['Wilson, Carmen L', 'Gawade, Prasad L', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['Wilson CL', 'Gawade PL', 'Ness KK']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Children (Basel),"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",101648936,,,,PMC4327873,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/02/19 06:01,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3390/children2010001 [doi]'],ppublish,Children (Basel). 2015;2(1):1-36. doi: 10.3390/children2010001.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BMD', 'BMI', 'cancer survivor', 'cardiopulmonary', 'childhood cancer', 'late effects', 'musculoskeletal', 'neuromotor', 'physical function', 'vision']",['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS651528'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphology of his leukemic blasts was consistent with the hypogranular variant of APL. Subsequent FISH and cytogenetic analysis revealed a unique translocation involving five chromosomal regions: 9q34, 17q21, 15q24, 12q13, and 15q26.1. Molecular testing demonstrated PML/RARA fusion transcripts. Treatment with conventional chemotherapy was added and he went into a complete remission. Given his elevated white blood cell count at presentation, intrathecal chemotherapy for central nervous system prophylaxis was also given. The patient remains on maintenance therapy and remains in remission. This is the first such report of a 5-way chromosomal translocation leading to APL. Similar to APL with chromosomal translocations other than classical t(15;17) which result in the typical PML-RARA fusion, our patient responded promptly to an ATRA-containing regimen and remains in complete remission.","['Powers, Benjamin', 'Persons, Diane', 'Rao, Deepthi', 'Woodroof, Janet', 'Lin, Tara L']","['Powers B', 'Persons D', 'Rao D', 'Woodroof J', 'Lin TL']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150126,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC4321077,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/02/19 06:01,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/343854 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2015;2015:343854. doi: 10.1155/2015/343854.

In this study, drug response, growth promoting, and protein trafficking of FLT3 wild-type was compared with two active mutants (Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD)) and D835Y. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FLT3 was expressed on factor-dependent cells (FDC-P1) using retroviral transduction. The inhibitory effects of CEP701, imatinib, dasatinib, PKC412 and sunitinib were studied on cell proliferation and FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Total expression and proportion of intracellular and surface FLT3 was also determined. RESULTS: FDC-P1 cells became factor-independent after expression of human FLT3 mutants (ITD and D835Y). FDC-P1 cells expressing FLT3-ITD grow 3 to 4 times faster than those expressing FLT3-D835Y. FD-FLT3-ITD cells were three times more resistant to sunitinib than the FD-FLT3-WT cells. The Geo means for surface FLT3 expression in FD-FLT3-ITD and -D835Y were 65 and 70% less than the FD-FLT3-WT cells. About 40% of expressed FLT3 was detected as intracellular in FD-FLT3-D835Y cell compared to 4 and 4.5% in FD-FLT3-WT and -ITD cells. CONCLUSION: Retention of D835Y FLT3 mutant protein may cause altered signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways leading to lower proliferation rate in FD-FLT3-D835Y than the FLT3-WT and ITD mutant., these may also also contribute, along with the preferential affinity, to the increased sensitivity of D835Y of CEP701 and PKC412. Studying these genetic variations can help determining the prognosis and designing a therapeutic plan for the patients with FLT3 mutations.","['Mashkani, Baratali', 'Griffith, Renate', 'Ashman, Leonie']","['Mashkani B', 'Griffith R', 'Ashman L']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran ; Discipline of Medical Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.', 'School of Medical Sciences/Pharmacology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia ; School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.', 'Discipline of Medical Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC4328095,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/02/19 06:01,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2014 Nov;17(11):867-73.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Activating mutation', 'Drug response', 'FLT3', 'Protein trafficking']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to chemotherapy significantly improved efficacy including overall survival (OS) in untreated fit patients; humanized anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab and fully human anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab lead to improvement in refractory disease. Novel small molecule inhibitors such as ibrutinib and idelalisib demonstrated excellent activity and were very recently licensed in relapsed/refractory CLL. Obinutuzumab (GA101) is the newest monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of CLL. This novel, glycoengineered, type II humanized anti-CD20 antibody is characterized by enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and direct induction of cell death compared to type I antibodies. Combination of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil yielded significantly better OS in comparison to chlorambucil monotherapy in untreated comorbid patients.

Whilst classically it was cytokines and chemokines which were believed to control stem cell fate, more recently it has become apparent that the stem cell niche and highly conserved embryonic pathways play a key role in governing stem cell behavior. One of these pathways, the hedgehog signaling pathway, found in all organisms, is vitally important in embryogenesis, performing the function of patterning through early stages of development, and in adulthood, through the control of somatic stem cell numbers. In addition to these roles in health however, it has been found to be deregulated in a number of solid and hematological malignancies, components of the hedgehog pathway being associated with a poor prognosis. Further, these components represent viable therapeutic targets, with inhibition from a drug development perspective being readily achieved, making the hedgehog pathway an attractive potential therapeutic target. However, although the concept of cancer stem cells is well established, how these cells arise and the factors which influence their behavior are not yet fully understood. The role of the hedgehog signaling pathway and its potential as a therapeutic target in hematological malignancies is the focus of this review.","['Campbell, Victoria', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Campbell V', 'Copland M']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterninary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterninary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150116,New Zealand,Stem Cells Cloning,Stem cells and cloning : advances and applications,101535817,,,,PMC4325629,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/02/19 06:01,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/SCCAA.S58613 [doi]', 'sccaa-8-027 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cells Cloning. 2015 Jan 16;8:27-38. doi: 10.2147/SCCAA.S58613. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer stem cell', 'hedgehog signaling pathway', 'hematopoiesis', 'lymphoid', 'myeloid', 'stem cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, side effects can be significant, and patients with poor risk features have inferior outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate reduced-dose FCR (FCR-Lite) plus lenalidomide (FCR(2) ) followed by lenalidomide maintenance as a strategy to shorten immunochemotherapy in untreated CLL. Patients received four to six cycles of FCR(2) . Patients who were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) initiated 12 months of lenalidomide maintenance after either four or six cycles (based on MRD status). The primary study endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate after four cycles of FCR(2) . Twenty patients were evaluable. After four cycles of FCR(2) , response rates were: CR, 45.0%; CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), 5.0%; partial response (PR), 45.0%; and stable disease (SD), 5.0%. BM and PB samples from 27.8% and 52.9% of patients, respectively, were MRD negative. After six cycles, response rates were: CR, 58.3%; CRi, 16.7%; and PR, 25.0%. BM and PB samples from 50.0% and 72.7% of patients, respectively, were MRD negative. Overall, 75% of evaluable patients achieved a CR or CRi following FCR(2) . After 17.4 months of median follow-up, one progression and one death occurred. Our findings suggest that FCR(2) combines encouraging clinical activity with acceptable toxicity in previously untreated CLL. Lenalidomide can be safely added to FCR and may reduce chemotherapy exposure without compromising outcomes.","['Mato, Anthony R', 'Foon, Kenneth A', 'Feldman, Tatyana', 'Schuster, Stephen J', 'Svoboda, Jakub', 'Chow, Kar Fai', 'Valentinetti, Marisa', 'Mrkulic, Mary', 'Azzollini, Kelly', 'Gadaleta, Gabriella', 'Bhattacharyya, Pritish K', 'Zenreich, Joshua', 'Pascual, Lauren-Nicole', 'Yannotti, Kara', 'Kdiry, Sabrina', 'Howlett, Christina', 'Strelec, Lauren', 'Porter, David', 'Bejot, Coleen', 'Goy, Andre']","['Mato AR', 'Foon KA', 'Feldman T', 'Schuster SJ', 'Svoboda J', 'Chow KF', 'Valentinetti M', 'Mrkulic M', 'Azzollini K', 'Gadaleta G', 'Bhattacharyya PK', 'Zenreich J', 'Pascual LN', 'Yannotti K', 'Kdiry S', 'Howlett C', 'Strelec L', 'Porter D', 'Bejot C', 'Goy A']","['Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Medical Affairs, Celgene Corporation, Summit, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Pathology Department, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Pathology Department, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Clinical Services, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Lymphoma Division, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150330,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23983 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jun;90(6):487-92. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23983.

This review aimed to identify models of survivorship care to support the needs of haematology cancer survivors. METHOD: An integrative literature review method utilised a search of electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline, PsycInfo, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycArticles, and Cochrane Library) for eligible articles (up to July 2014). Articles were included if they proposed or reported the use of a model of care for haematology cancer survivors. RESULTS: Fourteen articles were included in this review. Eight articles proposed and described models of care, and six reported the use of a range of survivorship models of care in haematology cancer survivors. No randomised controlled trials or literature reviews were found to have been undertaken specifically with this cohort of cancer survivors. There was variation in the models described and who provided the survivorship care. CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of models of care, it is difficult to determine the best model of care for haematology cancer survivors. Many different models of care are being put into practice before robust research is conducted. Therefore, well-designed high-quality pragmatic randomised controlled trials are required to inform clinical practice.","['Taylor, Karen', 'Chan, Raymond Javan', 'Monterosso, Leanne']","['Taylor K', 'Chan RJ', 'Monterosso L']","['Western Australia Cancer and Palliative Care Network, 189 Royal St., East Perth, WA, 6004, Australia, kbrtaylor@me.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150219,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*nursing', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*nursing', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*nursing', '*Primary Care Nursing', '*Survivors']",,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/06/18 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-015-2652-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 May;23(5):1447-58. doi: 10.1007/s00520-015-2652-6.

These reactive species cause variable damage to cells and stimulate cellular responses. Here, we report the design of a novel biocompatible surface that decreases stress by not only morphologically modifying the dish surface by using poly(ethylene glycol) tethered chains, but also actively scavenging oxidative stress by using our novel nitroxide radical-containing polymer. A block copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly[(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl)aminomethylstyrene] (PEG-b-PMNT) was used to coat the surface of a dish. Differentiation of undifferentiated human leukemia (HL-60) cells was found to be suppressed on the polymer-coated dish. Notably, HL-60 cell cultivation caused apoptosis under high-density conditions, while spontaneous apoptosis was suppressed in cells plated on the PEG-b-PMNT-modified surface, because a healthy mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained. In contrast, low molecular weight antioxidants did not have apparent effects on the maintenance of mitochondria. We attribute this to the lack of cellular internalization of our immobilized polymer and selective scavenging of excessive ROS generated outside of cells. These results demonstrate the utility of our novel biocompatible material for actively scavenging ROS and thus maintaining cellular morphology.","['Ikeda, Yutaka', 'Yoshinari, Tomoki', 'Nagasaki, Yukio']","['Ikeda Y', 'Yoshinari T', 'Nagasaki Y']","['Department of Materials Science, Graduate School of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan.', 'Department of Materials Science, Graduate School of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan.', 'Department of Materials Science, Graduate School of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan.', ""Master's School of Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan."", 'Satellite Laboratory, International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS), Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150226,United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

Long-term follow-up of these patients suggests that RALD has an indolent clinical course whereas JMML is fatal if left untreated. Immunophenotyping peripheral blood from RALD patients shows characteristic circulating activated monocytes and polyclonal CD10(+) B cells. Distinguishing RALD from JMML and CMML has implications for clinical care and prognosis.","['Calvo, Katherine R', 'Price, Susan', 'Braylan, Raul C', 'Oliveira, Joao Bosco', 'Lenardo, Michael', 'Fleisher, Thomas A', 'Rao, V Koneti']","['Calvo KR', 'Price S', 'Braylan RC', 'Oliveira JB', 'Lenardo M', 'Fleisher TA', 'Rao VK']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIAID Clinical Genomics Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center.', 'Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIAID Clinical Genomics Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIAID Clinical Genomics Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20150217,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Young Adult']",PMC4424627,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31736-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-567917 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 30;125(18):2753-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-567917.

Developmental processes require a fine-tuned organization, mainly regulated by the well-known JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and ERK/MAPK pathways. SPREDs (Sprouty related proteins with EVH1 domain) were discovered as inhibitors of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, whereas nothing was known about their functions in ES cells and during early differentiation, so far. RESULTS: We generated SPRED1 and SPRED2 overexpressing and SPRED2 knockout murine ES cells to analyze the functions of SPRED proteins in ES cells and during early differentiation. Overexpression of SPREDs increases significantly the self-renewal and clonogenicity of murine ES cells, whereas lack of SPRED2 reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis. During early differentiation in embryoid bodies, SPREDs promote the pluripotent state and inhibit differentiation whereby mesodermal differentiation into cardiomyocytes is considerably delayed and inhibited. LIF- and growth factor-stimulation revealed that SPREDs inhibit ERK/MAPK activation in murine ES cells. However, no effects were detectable on LIF-induced activation of the JAK/STAT3, or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by SPRED proteins. CONCLUSIONS: We show that SPREDs promote self-renewal and inhibit mesodermal differentiation of murine ES cells by selective suppression of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in pluripotent cells.","['Muhl, Bastian', 'Hagele, Jasmin', 'Tasdogan, Alpaslan', 'Loula, Paraskevi', 'Schuh, Kai', 'Bundschu, Karin']","['Muhl B', 'Hagele J', 'Tasdogan A', 'Loula P', 'Schuh K', 'Bundschu K']","['Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany; Laboratory for Human Genetics, Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150313,United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Spred1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Spred2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mesoderm/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvdy.24261 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2015 Apr;244(4):591-606. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.24261.

The deviations were exaggerated in lamina-associated domains, with differences corresponding to methylation clusters and/or cytogenetic groups. Our data also suggested a pivotal role of polycomb and CTBP2 in de novo methylation, which may be traced back to bivalency status of embryonic stem cells.

In 1990, available therapy produced complete responses in <5% of treated patients. This is in marked contrast to modern regimens, which are reported to reliably produce complete responses in approximately 40% to 50% of patients. This remarkable improvement has been attributable to combination chemoimmunotherapy agents that have contributed to the backbone of therapy for patients with CLL. However, the disease is still incurable and these modern treatment regimens have been somewhat limited to the treatment of younger, physically ""fit"" patients with CLL due to their increased toxicity, including enhanced myelosuppression and immunosuppression. In addition, because patients receive multiple therapies during the course of their lifetime, the mounting toxicities as well as decreased efficacy often limit the repeated use of these more aggressive combination therapies. Fortunately, over the past 5 years, there has been an explosion of new active agents that have demonstrated remarkable activity in patients with recurrent/refractory disease as well as those who harbor poor cytogenetic abnormalities. The current review focuses on some of the novel small molecules that have either been approved or are at the forefront of clinical development in the treatment of patients with CLL.","['Lamanna, Nicole']",['Lamanna N'],"['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150217,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy']",,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29130 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jun 15;121(12):1917-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29130.

Parents of 683 cases and 1044 controls (92% vs. 71%) were interviewed. ELF-MF measurements (24-48 h), in the child's bedroom of the dwelling inhabited one year before diagnosis, were available for 412 cases and 587 controls included in the main conditional regression analyses. The magnetic field induction was 0.04 muT on average (geometric mean), with 0.6% of cases and 1.6% of controls exposed to >0.3 muT. The impact of changes in the statistical model, exposure metric, and data-set restriction criteria was explored via sensitivity analyses. No exposure-disease association was observed in analyses based on continuous exposure, while analyses based on categorical variables were characterized by incoherent exposure-outcome relationships. In conclusion, our results may be affected by several sources of bias and they are noninformative at exposure levels >0.3 muT. Nonetheless, the study may contribute to future meta- or pooled analyses. Furthermore, exposure levels among population controls are useful to estimate attributable risk.","['Salvan, Alberto', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Lagorio, Susanna', 'Magnani, Corrado']","['Salvan A', 'Ranucci A', 'Lagorio S', 'Magnani C']","['Institute for Systems Analysis and Computer Science ""Antonio Ruberti"", IASI-CNR, Via dei Taurini 19, 00185 Rome, Italy. alberto.salvan@gmail.com.', 'Medical Statistics & Cancer Epidemiology Unit-Department of Translational Medicine, CPO Piemonte and University of Eastern Piedmont, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy. alessandra.ranucci@cpo.it.', 'National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion-National Institute of Health, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy. susanna.lagorio@iss.it.', 'Medical Statistics & Cancer Epidemiology Unit-Department of Translational Medicine, CPO Piemonte and University of Eastern Piedmont, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy. corrado.magnani@cpo.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150216,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Risk Factors']",PMC4344719,2015/02/19 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph120202184 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph120202184 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2015 Feb 16;12(2):2184-204. doi: 10.3390/ijerph120202184.,,,,,,,,,,,,['SETIL Research Group'],,"['Assennato G', 'Bisanti L', 'Cannizzaro S', 'Celentano E', 'Cocco P', 'Cuttini M', 'Magnani C', 'Mattioli S', 'Merlo DF', 'Michelozzi P', 'Miligi L', 'Minelli L', 'Panelli F', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Zambon P', 'Andreuccetti D', ""d'Amore G"", 'Anglesio L', 'Pons O', 'Lombardi M', 'Poggi A', 'Polichetti A', 'Sgorbati G', 'Stievano B', 'Rosa M', 'Biancotto R', 'Tofani S', 'Valle M', 'Vecchia P', 'Gilardetti M', 'Roletti S', 'Benvenuti A', 'Legittimo P', 'Guidotti P', 'Bocchini V', 'Casotto V', 'Chiavarini M', 'de Nichilo G', 'De Salvo GL', 'Duglio E', 'Ferrante D', 'Farioli A', 'Gafa L', 'Galassi C', 'Greco A', 'Guarino E', 'Kirchmayer U', 'Massaglia P', 'Miceli G', 'Monetti D', 'Mosciatti P', 'Panico S', 'Rasulo A', 'Ru O', 'Salis A', 'Sampietro G', 'Sivo D', 'Valenti RM', 'Tumino R']","['Assennato, Giorgio', 'Bisanti, Luigi', 'Cannizzaro, Santina', 'Celentano, Egidio', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Cuttini, Marina', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Michelozzi, Paola', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Minelli, Liliana', 'Panelli, Franco', 'Torregrossa, Maria Valeria', 'Zambon, Paola', 'Andreuccetti, Daniele', ""d'Amore, Giovanni"", 'Anglesio, Laura', 'Pons, Ombretta', 'Lombardi, Mirti', 'Poggi, Andrea', 'Polichetti, Alessandro', 'Sgorbati, Giuseppe', 'Stievano, Bianca', 'Rosa, Maria', 'Biancotto, Renzo', 'Tofani, Santi', 'Valle, Massimo', 'Vecchia, Paolo', 'Gilardetti, Marco', 'Roletti, Stefano', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Legittimo, Patrizia', 'Guidotti, Paolo', 'Bocchini, Vittorio', 'Casotto, Veronica', 'Chiavarini, Manuela', 'de Nichilo, Gigliola', 'De Salvo, Gian Luca', 'Duglio, Elena', 'Ferrante, Daniela', 'Farioli, Andrea', 'Gafa, Lorenzo', 'Galassi, Claudia', 'Greco, Alessandra', 'Guarino, Erni', 'Kirchmayer, Ursula', 'Massaglia, Pia', 'Miceli, Giuseppe', 'Monetti, Daniele', 'Mosciatti, Paola', 'Panico, Salvatore', 'Rasulo, Assunta', 'Ru, Ornella', 'Salis, Alessio', 'Sampietro, Giuseppe', 'Sivo, Donato', 'Valenti, Rosaria Maria', 'Tumino, Rosario']",,

In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on early gestation in a mouse model. During early gestation, the expression of the melatonin's rate-limiting enzyme, AANAT, gradually increased - in the uterus while the MT2 melatonin receptor was only expressed at day 2 of gestation and no MT1 was detected. Based on these findings, we conducted a melatonin injection experiment which demonstrated that 15 mg/kg melatonin significantly improved the number of implantation sites and the litter size. Also, the blastocyst and uterus were collected to identify the local action of melatonin. In the melatonin-treated mice, the endometrium was thicker than in the control mice; melatonin also caused an increase in density of uterine glands, and the uterine gland index (UGI) was significantly elevated over that of the control. Serum steroid hormone measurements revealed that at day 6 of gestation (postimplantation), melatonin significantly downregulated the E2 level, with no obvious effects on progesterone. Gene expression assay revealed that melatonin significantly upregulated expression of HB-EGF, a crucial gene involved in implantation as well as its receptor ErbB1 in the blastocyst. In addition, PRA, an important gene which influences the decidual response and luminal cell differentiation, p53, which regulates uterine through leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), were both increased after melatonin treatment. These data suggest that melatonin and its MT2 receptor influence early gestation. Exogenous melatonin treatment can improve mouse embryo implantation and litter size, which may have important applications in human reproductive health and animal husbandry.","['He, Changjiu', 'Wang, Jing', 'Li, Yu', 'Zhu, Kuanfeng', 'Xu, Zhiyuan', 'Song, Yile', 'Song, Yukun', 'Liu, Guoshi']","['He C', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Zhu K', 'Xu Z', 'Song Y', 'Song Y', 'Liu G']","['National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Receptor, Melatonin, MT2)', 'EC 2.3.1.87 (Arylalkylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arylalkylamine N-Acetyltransferase/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Melatonin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Melatonin, MT2/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Uterus/chemistry/*metabolism']",,2015/02/19 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/02/19 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jpi.12216 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2015 Apr;58(3):300-9. doi: 10.1111/jpi.12216.

In the multivariate analysis, only Binet stage, 11q-, and high beta2microglobulin significantly predicted shorter OS. CLL with +12 entails a heterogeneous group with intermediate prognosis. However, a high proportion of cells carrying +12 separates a subgroup of patients with poor outcome.

We tested functional haplotype-based NAT1 and NAT2 gene polymorphisms in relation to risk of lymphoma overall and its major B cell subtypes, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We used allele specific primers and multiplex PCR to detect NAT1 and NAT2 haplotypes in 248 patients with incident lymphoma and 208 population controls. We inferred the NAT1 rapid and slow acetylator and the NAT2 rapid, intermediate or slow acetylator phenotype, based on published functional data on the respective genotypes. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for lymphoma, B-NHL, DLBCL, FL, CLL, and other B-NHL combined associated with the inferred rapid NAT1 acetylator and with the intermediate and slow NAT2 acetylator phenotypes were estimated with unconditional and polytomous logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender and education. NAT1 rapid acetylators showed a 2.8-fold excess risk (95% CI 1.5-5.2) for lymphoma (all subtypes combined). Risk was highest for CLL and FL, with significant heterogeneity detected across subtypes. Risk also increased with decreasing NAT2 acetylating capacity with no heterogeneity detected across B cell lymphoma subtypes. Risks did not vary by gender. Although poor statistical power was a major limitation in our study, larger studies and pooled analyses are warranted to test whether NAT1 and NAT2 gene polymorphisms might modulate risk of specific lymphoma subtypes through the varying metabolic activity of their products.

Very high dose single-agent cytarabine at 36 g/m(2) (ARA-36) was previously shown to be effective and tolerable in RR-AML. In this retrospective analysis, we aim to describe the toxicity and efficacy of ARA-36 as salvage therapy for patients with AML who are primary refractory to intensive daunorubicin-containing induction or those relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). Fifteen patients, median age 53 years, were included in the analysis. Six patients were treated for induction failure, one had resistant APL, and eight relapsed after alloSCT. Complete remission was achieved in 60% of patients. Surviving patients were followed for a median of 8.5 months. One-year overall survival was 54% (95% CI 30%-86%), and relapse rate from remission (n = 9) was 56%. Grade III/IV pulmonary, infectious, ocular and gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in 26%, 20%, 20% and 20% of patients respectively. Salvage therapy with ARA-36 regimen for RR-AML has considerable efficacy with manageable toxicity in patients with induction failure or post-transplant relapse.

It has a long undiagnosed latent period during which there can be irreparable damage to the pancreas and cardiovascular tissues. Recent studies have highlighted the roles of several microRNAs in CVD. Determining the microRNAs that link diabetes mellitus and CVD is an important topic to be explored. In the present review, we discuss the microRNAs that contribute to the progression of diabetes mellitus and CVD and focus on the miR-29 family microRNAs whose expression is upregulated by hyperglycemia and proinflammatory cytokines, the hallmarks of diabetes mellitus. Upregulation of miR-29 expression is a key factor in the loss of pancreatic beta cells and development of the first stage of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Additionally, miR-29-mediated suppression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), an important prosurvival protein, underlies Marfan's syndrome, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and diabetes mellitus-associated cardiomyocyte disorganization. Suppression of miR-29 expression and subsequent increase in the prosurvival MCL-1, however, promotes tumor development. Therefore, miR-29 mimics that suppress MCL-1 are hailed as tumor suppressors. The critical question is whether an increase in miR-29 levels is well tolerated in conditions of comorbidities in which insulin resistance is an underlying disease. In light of increasing awareness of the interconnection of diabetes mellitus, CVD, and cancer, it is of utmost importance to understand the mechanism of action of current treatment options on all of the comorbidities and careful evaluation of cardiovascular toxicity must accompany any treatment paradigm that increases miR-29 levels.","['Slusarz, Anna', 'Pulakat, Lakshmi']","['Slusarz A', 'Pulakat L']","['aDepartment of Medicine bDepartment of Biochemistry, University of Missouri cHarry S.

Although most cases show a poor prognosis, a minority has an indolent course. It is difficult to identify indolent MCL cases prospectively. T-cell leukemia/lymphoma protein 1 (TCL1) is expressed by several B-cell lymphomas, including MCL. This study examined the expression of TCL1 and its prognostic relevance for MCL. METHODS: Clinical data for 162 patients with MCL were collected. Of these, 144 cases with available tissues for tissue microarray construction and immunostaining were included in the analysis. TCL1 staining was quantified using the Nuclear Quant application with Pannoramic Viewer v. 1.14. High TCL1 expression was defined as moderate to strong nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining in 40% or more of the cells. RESULTS: High TCL1 expression was observed in 39 of 144 samples (27.1%). Patients with low TCL1 expression were more likely to present with blastoid/pleomorphic morphology (P = 0.010). Low TCL1 expression was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (OS, P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis identified low TCL1 expression (P = 0.003), high-risk MIPI (P = 0.027), and anemia (P = 0.018) as adverse prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that TCL1 expression profile may have a role in the prediction of overall outcome in patient with MCL and call for prospective studies.","['Shin, Su-Jin', 'Roh, Jin', 'Cha, Hee Jeong', 'Choi, Yoo Duk', 'Kim, Jin-Man', 'Min, Soo Kee', 'Kim, Ji Eun', 'Eom, Dae-Woon', 'Lee, Hojung', 'Kim, Hyun-Jung', 'Yoon, Dok Hyun', 'Suh, Cheolwon', 'Huh, Jooryung']","['Shin SJ', 'Roh J', 'Cha HJ', 'Choi YD', 'Kim JM', 'Min SK', 'Kim JE', 'Eom DW', 'Lee H', 'Kim HJ', 'Yoon DH', 'Suh C', 'Huh J']","['Departments of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Gangneung Asan Hospital, Gangneung, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Eulji Medical Center, Eulji University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Sanggye Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20150316,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12539 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Dec;95(6):583-94. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12539.

Our previous work has demonstrated that Sprouty-related EVH1 domainprotein2 (Spred2) was involved in imatinib mediated cytotoxicity in CML cells. However, its roles in growth and lineage differentiation of CML cells remain unknown. In this study, we found that CML CD34+ cells expressed lower level of Spred2 compared with normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and adenovirus mediated restoration of Spred2 promoted the erythroid differentiation of CML cells. Imatinib could induce Spred2 expression and enhance erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. However, the imatinib induced erythroid differentiation could be blocked by Spred2 silence using lentiviral vector PLKO.1-shSpred2. Spred2 interference activated phosphorylated-ERK (p-ERK) and inhibited erythroid differentiation, while ERK inhibitor, PD98059, could restore the erythroid differentiation, suggesting Spred2 regulated the erythroid differentiation partly through ERK signaling. Furthermore, Spred2 interference partly restored p-ERK level leading to inhibition of erythroid differentiation in imatinib treated K562 cells. In conclusion, Spred2 was involved in erythroid differentiation of CML cells and participated in imatinib induced erythroid differentiation partly through ERK signaling.","['Yang, Yuefeng', 'Liu, Xiaoyun', 'Xiao, Fengjun', 'Xue, Shuya', 'Xu, Qinqin', 'Yin, Yue', 'Sun, Huiyan', 'Xu, Jie', 'Wang, Hengxiang', 'Zhang, Qunwei', 'Wang, Hua', 'Wang, Lisheng']","['Yang Y', 'Liu X', 'Xiao F', 'Xue S', 'Xu Q', 'Yin Y', 'Sun H', 'Xu J', 'Wang H', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang H', 'Wang L']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', 'Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Lanzhou Command, Lanzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', ""Department of Oncology, Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital, Xining, PR China."", 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Air Force, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150217,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SPRED2 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Erythroid Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4331423,2015/02/18 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0117573 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-36565 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 17;10(2):e0117573. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0117573. eCollection 2015.,,,,['R21 AA020515/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We measured overall genomic levels of 5hmC and 5mC in patients with SM by dot blot, as well as by quantitative immunofluorescence in samples of cutaneous mastocytosis. RESULTS: Overall 5hmC levels were reduced in all patients with SM, but to a greater extent in the presence of higher D816V mutational load in the KIT oncogene, which affects prognosis and therapeutic options in these patients. Loss of 5hmC was likely due to systemic effects of SM as it did not correlate with overall mast cell burden in these patients, nor it was due to inactivating mutations of TET2 or reduced TET2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between SM diagnosis and significantly low 5hmC levels suggests that reduction of 5hmC represents a systemic effect of SM that may be useful for patient stratification and that measurements of 5hmC levels may serve as a better prognostic marker than TET2 mutations.","['Leoni, Cristina', 'Montagner, Sara', ""Deho', Lorenzo"", ""D'Antuono, Rocco"", 'De Matteis, Giovanna', 'Marzano, Angelo V', 'Merante, Serena', 'Orlandi, Ester M', 'Zanotti, Roberta', 'Monticelli, Silvia']","['Leoni C', 'Montagner S', ""Deho' L"", ""D'Antuono R"", 'De Matteis G', 'Marzano AV', 'Merante S', 'Orlandi EM', 'Zanotti R', 'Monticelli S']","[""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", 'Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", 'Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", 'Section of Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Life and Reproduction Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', ""Dipartimento di Fisiopatologia Medico-Chirurgica e dei Trapianti, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Unita Operativa di Dermatologia, IRCCS Fondazione Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology-Hematology, Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology-Hematology, Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Verona, Italy.', ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150316,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12537 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Dec;95(6):566-75. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12537.

DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or CD2, and presence of KITD816V. RISK STRATIFICATION: The 2008 World Health Organization classification of SM has been shown to be prognostically relevant. Classification of SM patients into indolent SM (ISM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), and mast cell leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis. MANAGEMENT: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-alpha (+/-corticosteroids) can control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting; there is a role for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in select cases. Investigational Drugs: Recent data confirms midostaurin's significant anti-MC activity in patients with advanced SM.","['Pardanani, Animesh']",['Pardanani A'],"['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tryptases/blood']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23931 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Mar;90(3):250-62. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23931.,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore not surprising that in some patients the management of AML will be complicated by a coexistent pregnancy. However, the association of leukemia and pregnancy is uncommon. Its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 75,000 to 100,000 pregnancies. During pregnancy, most leukemias are acute: two thirds are myeloid and one third are lymphoblastic. There is no standard approach for this clinical dilemma, in part because of variables such as the type of AML, the seriousness of the symptoms, and the patient's personal beliefs. In many cases, the diagnostic work up has to be altered because of the pregnancy, and often available treatments have varying risks to the fetus. While chemotherapy is reported to have some risks during the first trimester, it is admitted that it can be administered safely during the second and the third trimesters.

The possibility of inhibiting the interaction of chemokine receptors present on the surface of tumor cells with their ligands emerged as a new therapeutic approach. Therefore, many research groups and companies began to develop small molecule antagonists and specific antibodies, aiming to neutralize signaling from these receptors.

One such hematologic malignancy, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), may be highly dependent on epigenetic regulation for leukemia development and maintenance, and thus sensitive to small-molecule inhibitors that target epigenetic mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A panel of B-ALL cell lines was tested for sensitivity to HDACi with varying isoform sensitivity. Isoform-specific shRNAs were used as further validation of HDACs as relevant therapeutic targets in B-ALL. Mouse xenografts of B-cell malignancy-derived cell lines and a pediatric B-ALL were used to demonstrate pharmacologic efficacy. RESULTS: Nonselective HDAC inhibitors were cytotoxic to a panel of B-ALL cell lines as well as to xenografted human leukemia patient samples. Assessment of isoform-specific HDACi indicated that targeting HDAC1-3 with class I HDAC-specific inhibitors was sufficient to inhibit growth of B-ALL cell lines. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC1 or HDAC2 resulted in growth inhibition in these cells. We then assessed a compound that specifically inhibits only HDAC1 and HDAC2. This compound suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in B-ALL cell lines in vitro and in vivo, whereas it was far less effective against other B-cell-derived malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that HDAC inhibitors are a potential therapeutic option for B-ALL, and that a more specific inhibitor of HDAC1 and HDAC2 could be therapeutically useful for patients with B-ALL.","['Stubbs, Matthew C', 'Kim, Wonil', 'Bariteau, Megan', 'Davis, Tina', 'Vempati, Sridhar', 'Minehart, Janna', 'Witkin, Matthew', 'Qi, Jun', 'Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Bradner, James E', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Stubbs MC', 'Kim W', 'Bariteau M', 'Davis T', 'Vempati S', 'Minehart J', 'Witkin M', 'Qi J', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Bradner JE', 'Kung AL', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. mstubbs@incyte.com."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber-Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

We tested whether previously described risk factors are also valid in younger, poor-prognosis DLBCL patients. Paraffin-embedded samples from 112 patients with de novo DLBCL, enrolled in the R-MegaCHOEP trial of the German High Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (DSHNHL) were investigated using immunohistochemistry (MYC, FOXP1, LMO2, GCET1, CD5, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, IRF4/MUM1) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (MYC, BCL2, BCL6). MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 breaks occurred in 14, 21 and 31%, respectively. In the majority of cases, MYC was simultaneously rearranged with BCL2 and/or BCL6. The adverse impact of MYC rearrangements was confirmed, but the sole presence of BCL2 breaks emerged as a novel prognostic marker associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (P=0.002). Combined overexpression of MYC and BCL2 showed only limited association with inferior OS. All immunohistochemical cell of origin classifiers applied failed to predict survival time. DLBCL tumors with significant proportion of immunoblastic and/or immunoblastic-plasmacytoid cells had inferior OS, independently from from BCL2 break. Younger, poor-prognosis DLBCL patients, therefore, display different biological risk factors compared with an elderly population, with BCL2 translocations emerging as a powerful negative prognostic marker.","['Horn, H', 'Ziepert, M', 'Wartenberg, M', 'Staiger, A M', 'Barth, T F E', 'Bernd, H-W', 'Feller, A C', 'Klapper, W', 'Stuhlmann-Laeisz, C', 'Hummel, M', 'Stein, H', 'Lenze, D', 'Hartmann, S', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Moller, P', 'Cogliatti, S', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Trumper, L', 'Loeffler, M', 'Glass, B', 'Schmitz, N', 'Ott, G', 'Rosenwald, A']","['Horn H', 'Ziepert M', 'Wartenberg M', 'Staiger AM', 'Barth TF', 'Bernd HW', 'Feller AC', 'Klapper W', 'Stuhlmann-Laeisz C', 'Hummel M', 'Stein H', 'Lenze D', 'Hartmann S', 'Hansmann ML', 'Moller P', 'Cogliatti S', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Trumper L', 'Loeffler M', 'Glass B', 'Schmitz N', 'Ott G', 'Rosenwald A']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, and Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Universitat Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitat Wurzburg and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCCMF), Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, and Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pathodiagnostik Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Kantonal Hospital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Medizinische Klinik I, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August Universitat, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Universitat Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Asklepios Klinik St Georg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Asklepios Klinik St Georg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitat Wurzburg and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCCMF), Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201543 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.43 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1564-70. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.43.

FCoV seroprevalence increased until 2 years of age, was highest in 2014 and among household cats living with other cats and with outdoor access, and was lower in FIV seropositive compared to seronegative cats. Symptoms typically associated with wet feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) including ascites, abdominal distention or pleural effusion, coupled in many cases with non-antibiotic responsive fever, were observed in 19% (32/169) of cats, and 75% (24/32) of these cats were FCoV seropositive.

The percentage of FCoV seropositive and seronegative cats that died in spite of supportive veterinary treatment was 33% (21/63) and 12% (13/106), respectively. These results indicate that FCoV is widespread and has a severe clinical impact in cats from Istanbul. Moreover, the incidence of FCoV infections could be rising, and in the absence of effective vaccination cat owners need to be made aware of ways to minimize the spread of this virus.","['Tekelioglu, B K', 'Berriatua, E', 'Turan, N', 'Helps, C R', 'Kocak, M', 'Yilmaz, H']","['Tekelioglu BK', 'Berriatua E', 'Turan N', 'Helps CR', 'Kocak M', 'Yilmaz H']","['Macka Veterinary Clinic, Besiktas, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Animal Health Department, Regional Campus of International Excellence ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients in clinical remission retained abnormal DNA methylation patters and whether these were associated with patient outcome. MATERIALS & METHODS: We investigated CpG island methylation of genes known to exhibit hypermethylation in leukemia using quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. RESULTS: Although methylation levels were reduced in remission samples, they remained significantly higher than those seen in healthy controls. This retained methylation was not related to low levels of residual leukemia cells still present at remission. Methylation levels were also stable (or increased) during continuous remission and significantly correlated with long-term survival in adult ALL patients. CONCLUSION: This study determined that abnormalities in DNA methylation are retained during ALL remission and may represent a novel prognostic marker for adult ALL patients.","['van Otterdijk, Sanne D', 'Norden, Jean', 'Dickinson, Anne M', 'Pearce, Mark S', 'Relton, Caroline L', 'Mathers, John C', 'Strathdee, Gordon']","['van Otterdijk SD', 'Norden J', 'Dickinson AM', 'Pearce MS', 'Relton CL', 'Mathers JC', 'Strathdee G']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2015/09/08 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/epi.14.78 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2015;7(1):35-45. doi: 10.2217/epi.14.78.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CpG island', 'DNA methylation', 'leukemia', 'prognostic marker', 'remission']",['MC_UU_12013/2/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the newly modified protocol, Xenopus laevis H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are expressed individually into inclusion bodies of bacteria, which are subsequently mixed together and denatured in 8M guanidine hydrochloride. Histones are refolded and reconstituted into soluble octamer by dialysis against 2M NaCl, and metal-affinity purified through an N-terminal polyhistidine-tag added on the H2A. After cleavage of the polyhistidine-tag, histone octamer is further purified by size exclusion chromatography. We show that the nucleosomes reconstituted using the purified histone octamer above are fully functional. They serve as effective substrates for the histone methyltransferases DOT1L and MLL1. Small angle X-ray scattering further confirms that the reconstituted nucleosomes have correct structural integration of histone octamer and DNA as observed in the X-ray crystal structure. Our new protocol enables rapid reconstitution of histone octamer with an optimal yield. We expect this simplified approach to facilitate research using recombinant nucleosomes in vitro.","['Lee, Young-Tae', 'Gibbons, Garrett', 'Lee, Shirley Y', 'Nikolovska-Coleska, Zaneta', 'Dou, Yali']","['Lee YT', 'Gibbons G', 'Lee SY', 'Nikolovska-Coleska Z', 'Dou Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

Here, we describe a chromatin-based mechanism that enables integration of TCR specificity into definite T cell lineage commitment. Using natural killer T cells (iNKT cell) as a model of a T cell subset that differentiates in response to specific TCR signaling, we identified a key role of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in coupling iNKT cell TCR specificity with the generation of iNKT cells. We found that the Zbtb16/PLZF gene promoter that drives iNKT cell differentiation possesses a bivalent chromatin state characterized by the simultaneous presence of negative and positive H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications. Depletion of H3K27me3 at the Zbtb16/PLZF promoter leads to uncoupling of iNKT cell development from TCR specificity and is associated with accumulation of iNKT-like CD4(+) cells that express a non-iNKT cell specific T cell repertoire. In turn, stabilization of H3K27me3 leads to a drastic reduction of the iNKT cell population. Our data suggest that H3K27me3 levels at the bivalent Zbtb16/PLZF gene define a threshold enabling precise coupling of TCR specificity to lineage commitment.","['Dobenecker, Marc-Werner', 'Kim, Jong Kyong', 'Marcello, Jonas', 'Fang, Terry C', 'Prinjha, Rab', 'Bosselut, Remy', 'Tarakhovsky, Alexander']","['Dobenecker MW', 'Kim JK', 'Marcello J', 'Fang TC', 'Prinjha R', 'Bosselut R', 'Tarakhovsky A']","['Laboratory of Immune Cell Epigenetics and Signaling, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065 dobenem@rockefeller.edu tarakho@rockefeller.edu.', 'Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Immune Cell Epigenetics and Signaling, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065.', 'Laboratory of Immune Cell Epigenetics and Signaling, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065.', 'Epinova DPU, Immuno-Inflammation Therapy Area, GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Medicines Research Centre, Stevenage SG1 2NY, England, UK.', 'Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Immune Cell Epigenetics and Signaling, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065 dobenem@rockefeller.edu tarakho@rockefeller.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150216,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Utx protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.5.- (Kdm6b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', '*T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity']",PMC4354372,2015/02/18 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20141499 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20141499 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2015 Mar 9;212(3):297-306. doi: 10.1084/jem.20141499.

METHODS: (1) Compared with mature B lymphoctyes during stationary phase in peripheral blood from healthy people, the cell cycle and the expression of CD71 and Ki-67 of cell lines from patients with leukemia and lymphoma were examined, the correlation among CD71, S-phase cell fraction (SPF) and Ki-67 were analyzed; (2) Compared with mature B lymphoctyes in bone marrow from non-hematologic disease patients, the expression and correlation of CD71 and Ki-67 of all kinds of leukemic cells and myeloma cells from bone marrow were analyzed by using Ki-67/CD71/CD45/CD123, Ki-67/CD71/CD45/CD20 or Ki-67/CD71/CD45/CD138. RESULTS: (1) in respect to the expression rate of CD71 on tumor cell lines, the expression rate of CD71 on HL-60 cells was (99.77 +/- 0.064)%, the expression rate of CD71 on NB4 cells was (99.23 +/- 0.12)%, the expression rate on THP-1 cells was (98.90 +/- 0.30)% and the expression rate on K562 cells was (97.03 +/- 0.15)% in myelogenous leukemia cell lines, the expression rate of CD71 on Raji cells was (99.35 +/- 0.21)% and the expression rate on Mino cell was (96.95 +/- 0.42)% in lymphoma cell lines, which were also obviously higher than that on cells of the control group (P < 0.05); (2) in respect to the expression rate of CD71 on tumor cells in bone marrow, the expression rate of CD71 on poorly differentiated AML(M1 and M2) cells was (51.50 +/- 19.31)%, the expression rate of CD71 on acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) cells was (35.71 +/- 14.02) %, the expression rate of CD71 on acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) cells was (30.54 +/- 14.38)%, the expression rate of CD71 on acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells was (68.40 +/- 20.83)%, the expression rate of CD71 on acute B lymphoblastic leukemia was (39.67 +/- 18.27)%, the expression rate of CD71 on multiple myeloma (MM) cells was (55.49 +/- 18.15%), the expression rate of CD71 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL) was (1.32 +/- 0.33%), which were also higher than that on cells in the control group(P < 0.05) except for CLL cells (P > 0.05); (3) CD71 had a positive linear corrlation with SPF in cell lines (r = 0.914, P < 0.05), and also had a positive linear corrlation with Ki-67 in cell lines and carcinoma cells from bone marrow (r = 0.894,r = 0.904, P < 0.05).

METHODS: A total of 106 cases of CML received allo-HSCT were retrospectively studied in Nanfang Hospital from May 2003 to May 2013. On the basis of existence or absence of acute heart failure during early stage of allo-HSCT (100 d), the patients were divided into heart failure (15 cases) and control group (91 cases). Using Logistic univariate analysis, Fisher' exact test and Pearson X(2) test, the acute heart failure's risk factors and clinical characteristics of both groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The median occurrence time of acute heart failure was 3 d (1 d before transplantation to 84 d after transplantation). Logistic univariate analysis indicated that the imatinib treatment history and time, and the prophylaxis regimens for GVHD with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) were all the poor prognostic factors for acute heart failure.

METHODS: The BMMNC from 9 normal controls, 19 cases of low-risk MDS, 14 cases of high-risk MDS and 7 cases of MDS-transformed AML were collected. The expression level of BECLIN-1 was detected by real time PCR (RT-PCR) and the amount of autophagic vacuoles was counted by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: The expression level of BECLIN-1 in BMMNC from patients with low-risk group was obviously higher than that in BMMNC from normal controls; the expression level of BECLIN-1 in BMMNC from patients of hgh risk group was higher than that in BMMNC of normal group, but there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05); the expression level of BECLIN-1 in BMMNC from patients with MDS-transformed AML group was significanly lower than that in BMMNC of normal group (P < 0.05). Transinission electron microscopy showed that the amount of autophagic vacuoles in BMMNC from patients with low-risk and high-risk MDS groups was more than that in normal control, but there was no stetistcal significance (P > 0.05), while the amount of autopuagic vecuoles in BMMNC from patients of MDS-transformed AML group was significantly less (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of BECLIN-1 and the number of autophagic vacuoles in BMMNC from patients with MDS progression and patients with MDS-transformed AML are gradually declining.

METHODS: ATO with different concentration (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 micromol/L) were used to treat K562 cells, and MTT assay was used to detect the growth level of K562 cells; Benzidine staining was applied to measure the change of hemoglobin content; flow cytometry (FCM) was conducted to detect the expression of CD41 and GPA on K562 cells; RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure the mRNA expression of BTG1 and TAL1 and the protein expression of BTG1 and TAL1, respectively. RESULTS: ATO significantly inhibited the growth of K562 with dose- and time- dependent manners by benzidine staining, the positive rate of K562 cells induced by ATO reached to 17.63% +/- 1.18%, which was significantly higher than that of control (2.87% +/- 0.63%) (P < 0.01), and GPA, as the specific marker of erythroid cell differentiation, achieved 68.46% +/- 3.67%, while it in control was 3.39% +/- 0.84% (P < 0.01), besides, the CD41 expression of megakaryocyte increased but not so obvious as GPA. Meanwhile, the differentiation-related transcriptional factors TAL1 and BTG1 mRNA and the corresponding proteins were expressed more highly. CONCLUSION: ATO can induce the differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid cells and megakaryocyte, which is associated with up-regulation of the related transcription factors TAL1 and BTG1.","['Lyu, Fei-Fei', 'Du, Yan', 'Li, Nan-Nan', 'Wang, Wei']","['Lyu FF', 'Du Y', 'Li NN', 'Wang W']","['Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University (175th Hospital of Chinese PLA), Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian Province, China.

METHODS: The morphological features of bone marrow cells from patient were observed by light microscope, the immunophenotype were detected by flow cytometry, the cytogenetic characteristics were assayed by conventional chromosomal analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: at onset of disease, the patient was diagnosed as B-CLL, Rai stage is II. He was treated with a course of RF(fludarabine 50 mgx5, rituximab 600 mgx5) chemotherapy, and achived complete remission (CR) lasting for five years, then the patient was treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy and maintained at a steady state of disease. After the last chemotherapy, this patient developed a fever, his temperature fluctuated at 37.2-38.7 degrees C, the lung CT showed the presence of massive shadow, repeated 1-3-beta-D-glucan test was positive,and he was considered as invasive aspergillosis infection, voriconazole was intravenously injected him for 2 months, his lung CT showed better efficacy. However, the leukemia continued progress, his hemogram was extremely low, invasive aspergillosis infection relapsed,voriconazole treatment was poor effect,ultimately this patient died of the rapid progress of leukemia and multiple organ invasive aspergillosis. Autopsy showed chronic lymphocytic leukemia with multiple metastases and multiple organ invasive aspergillosis. CONCLUSION: invasive aspergillosis is a serious complication for CLL patients,once occurs, the prognosis is poor,so early diagnosis and prophylactic antifungal therapy may reduce fungal infection complication.","['Li, Bao-Ling', 'Li, Su-Xia', 'Wang, Tong-Min', 'Zhu, Hong-Li', 'Wang, Hai-Tao', 'Li, Jie', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhai, Bing']","['Li BL', 'Li SX', 'Wang TM', 'Zhu HL', 'Wang HT', 'Li J', 'Liu Y', 'Zhai B']","['Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.

METHODS: Lentivirus-has-miR-150 was constructed and transfected to Jurkat cells. The expression of miR-150 was detected by real time PCR; the cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 method and Annexin V/7-AAD labeling, respectively; the cell-related protein expressions of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(PI3K)/serine/ threonine kinase (Akt) signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of miR-150 in infected Jurkat cells was significantly upregulated by constructing lentivirus-has-miR-150. Compared to negative control (transfected with empty-vector lentivirus), the cell proliferation after LV-miR-150 transfection was significantly inhibited and cell apoptosis was remarkably induced. Phosphorylation levels of P13K/Akt/NF-kappaB signaling pathway protein p-Akt and p-p65 decreased,whereas no obvious change was found in the expression of Akt. CONCLUSION: miR-150 may be a putative oncoprotein in T-ALL cells. Overexpression of miR-150 has noticeable effects on the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of Jurkat cells, which may be mediated by the negative regulation of PI3K/Akt /NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Wang, Ying', 'Sang, Wei', 'Sun, Cai', 'Zeng, Ling-Yu', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Wang Y', 'Sang W', 'Sun C', 'Zeng LY', 'Xu KL']","['Department of Hematology,The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College,Xuzhou 221002,Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology,The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College,Xuzhou 221002,Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology,The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College,Xuzhou 221002,Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology,The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College,Xuzhou 221002,Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology,The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College,Xuzhou 221002,Jiangsu Province, China.

METHODS: The human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell NB4 was treated with different concentrations (0, 1.5, 3, 6 and 12 micromol/L) of sorafenib, the proliferation inhibitory rate of NB4 cells was assayed by MTT, the apoptosis of NB4 was determined with flow-cytomatry after treatment; after extraction of total protein, the Western blot was performed to determine the expressions of apoptosis-relatived molecules Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and MCL-1. The mRNA expressions of Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and MCL-1 were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: As compared with the control group, the proliferation of NB4 significantly decreased after treatment with different concentrations of sorafenib. The sorafenib significantly induced the apopotosis of NB4 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. Furthermore, sorafenib treatment resulted in the obvious increase of the Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 protein and mRNA expressions, and down-regulated the MCL-1 protein and mRNA expressions in NB4 cells.

In addition to the constitutive expression in the leukemia prior to chemotherapy, a complex phenotype of pleiotropic resistance is presented in the residual or recurrent leukemia. Recent studies showed Dox-induced coexpression of COX2 and MDR1 genes in human leukaemia cells, and whether Dox-induced MDR1 up-regulation in acute leukaemia cells is dependent on COX2-transcriptional activity and thus might be overcome or prevented with COX2-promotor inhibitor quercetin interfering with COX2 expression and activity. This study was purposed to investigate the impacts of quercetin on Dox-induced mRNA expression of MDR1 and COX2 genes in HL-60 leukemia cells. METHODS: The MDR1 and COX2 mRNA expression in HL-60 cells was detected by RT-PCR; the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release was measured by ELISA; the cytotoxicity of Dox was determined by MTT test. RESULTS: The incubation of HL-60 cells with Dox not only up-regulated MDR1 mRNA, but also COX2 mRNA expression, and after co-incubation with quercetin or celecoxib, Dox-induced overexpression of MDR1 and COX2 mRNA were reduced by quercetin, not by celecoxib, whereas PGE2 release was significantly decreased with subsequent enhancement of Dox cytotoxic efficacy by both of them. CONCLUSIONS: Dox-induced MDR1 up-regulation may be dependent on COX2-transcriptional activity, not PGE2, suggesting that the existence of causal link between COX2 and MDR1 expression induced by Dox, and modulation of COX2 transcriptional expression by quercetin would not only sensitize leukemia cells to Dox, but also prevent the acquisition of MDR during chemotherapy.","['He, Hai-Lan', 'Ji, Li-Juan', 'Li, Qi-Zhi', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Huang, Jian-Ming', 'Li, Ge']","['He HL', 'Ji LJ', 'Li QZ', 'Zhang R', 'Huang JM', 'Li G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial Peopel Hospital, Chengdu 610072, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial Peopel Hospital, Chengdu 610072, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Sichuan Provincial Cancer Institute, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial Peopel Hospital, Chengdu 610072, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Sichuan Provincial Cancer Institute, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China.

METHODS: Three-five-week-old SCID beige mice were divided randomly into two groups: experimental and control group. SCID mice of experimental group were transplanted by tail vein (iv) injection of 5x10(6) NB4 cells. The WBC cell count and the positive rate of promyelocytes in peripheral blood were dynamically monitored by using smears. Morphological examination and histopathological assay were employed to confirm NB4 cell infiltration in organs (liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain). The expression level of PML-RARalpha fusion protein was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Within two weeks there was no significant difference in peripheral blood WBC count between two groups (P > 0.05), meanwhile, NB4 cells were not found. At the day 21 and 28 after inoculation, the peripheral blood white blood cell count of experimental group reached to (4.79 +/- 1.13)x10(9)/L and (7.62 +/- 2.24)x10(9)/L respectively, which were significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05); simultaneously, the positive rates of promyelocytes on smears were (2.14 +/- 0.63)% and (6.6 +/- 2.76)%, respectively. Morphological observation showed single or multiple tumor lumps at day 21 after inoculation; HE staining of tissue biopsies demonstrated a large number of promyelocyte in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain tissue. Cell immunofluorescence results showed that the CD33 expression of bone marrow cells in mice of experimental group was strongly positive (P < 0.05). Western blot confirmed that the PML-RARalpha fusion protein was expressed variously in liver, kidney and brain tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The human acute promyelocytic leukemia SCID mouse model is succesfully established by tail vein injection of NB4 cells.

METHODS: Mononuclear cells were isolated from 27 newly diagnosed AML samples. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. IC(50) value of S1 on these samples was determined by XTT assay. The expression level of BCL-2 family members and phosphorylated BCL-2 were assessed by Western blot with subsequent semi-quantitatively densitometric analysis. XTT assay was performed to determine the cell viability of the combined use of S1 and MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059. The interactions between BCL-2 and pro-apoptosis proteins were tested by co-immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: The flow-cytometry detection showed that S1 induced the apoptosis of primary AML cells. Based on the responses, 27 primary samples could be classified into three groups: (1) a sensitive group (12 of 27 cases) with IC(50)<14 micromol/L, (2) an intermediate group (8 of 27 cases) with IC(50) of 14-30 micromol/L and (3) a resistant group (7 of 27 cases) with IC(50)>30 micromol/L. The ratio of pBCL-2/(BCL-2+MCL-1) showed a good linear correlation with the IC(50) values. (R(2) = 0.71, P < 0.0001). PD98059 suppressed BCL-2 phosphorylation. When PD98059 suppressed BCL-2 phosphorylation, the apoptotic rate of drug-resistant cells induced by S1 increased from 9.8% to 64.5% (combination index, CI = 0.4), accompanied by more dissociation of BCL-2 heterodimers. CONCLUSION: The combination of S1 with PD98059 decrease pBCL-2 level of AML patients and inhibits of the anti-apoptotic function of BCL-2 through enhancing the dissociation of BCL-2 heterodimers.","['Wang, Xiao-Bo', 'Shi, Ming', 'Mu, Li-Jun', 'Sun, Jian', 'Li, Wei-Ping', 'Xue, Zu-Guang']","['Wang XB', 'Shi M', 'Mu LJ', 'Sun J', 'Li WP', 'Xue ZG']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Complex Laboratory of Clinical Examination, Laboratory Medical College, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, Liaoning Province, China.

METHODS: The real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of SIRT1 in AML1-ETO positive leukemia cell line and clinical samples of leukemia patients, a SIRT1 promoter-luciferase reporter vector was constructed and the promoter activity was evaluated in the 293T cell line. A series of possible core promoter fragments of the SIRT1 5'-untranslated region were amplified by PCR, the PCR products were cloned into XhoI/HindIII-digested pGL3-Basic reporter vector, the poly-cationic compound SuperFect reporter vector complexes were transfected into 293T cells.The dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System was used to quantitate the reporter vector luciferase activity. RESULTS: The six kinds of promoter fragment of SIRT1 gene were successfully constructed and cloned into the pGL3-Basic reporter vector, which was authenticated by XhoI/HindIII co-digestion and DNA sequencing. The luciferase activity of the promoter construct was significantly higher than that of the pGL3-Basic promoter in 293T cells. The luciferase report gene assay was also used to detect the regulation of AML1-ETO on the transcription activity of SIRT1 promoter. The results showed that the expression level of SIRT1 increased with the increase mens of AML1-ETO, the promoter of SIRT1 could be bound by AML1-ETO. CONCLUSION: The SIRT1 promoter-luciferase reporter vector is successfully constructed, the transfection system used in this study can effectively transfer gene in 293T cells. The SIRT1 core promoter possesses higher activity in 293T cells and can promote significantly expression of luciferase reporter gene in 293T cells. The transcription regulation of AML1-ETO on SIRT1 is carried out via promoting its promoter activity.","['Wang, Qian', 'Dou, Li-Ping', 'Li, Yong-Hui', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Li, Dan-Dan', 'Wang, Li-Jun', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang Q', 'Dou LP', 'Li YH', 'Wang LL', 'Zhou L', 'Li DD', 'Wang LJ', 'Yu L']","['Department of hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.

METHODS: Diagnostic DNA samples from 109 newly diagnosed children with ALL admitted from August 2007 to March 2010, and 94 ALL children in CR (complete remission) among them were collected. Bisulfite modification and MethyLight method established by our research team were used to determine the methylation level of the two key CpG sites (at -1189 and -1176) of the promoter of CASP8AP2 gene. RESULTS: The average methylation level of the two CpG sites in newly diagnosted samples was higher than that in CR samples (71.1% +/- 1.7% vs 64.2% +/- 21.2%) (P = 0.008). Analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the area under curve was 0.687 (P = 0.024), indicating that the methylation level of the two CpG sites was able to predict relapse efficiently to some extent, 76.9% was chosed as a cutoff value to divide the patients into high methylation group (49 patients) and low methylation group (60 patients). The incidence of relapse in high methylation group was higher than that in low methylation group (20.4% vs 6.7%) (P = 0.044), five year relapse free survival in high methylation group was also lower than that in low methylation group (Log rank, P = 0.033). Furthermore, high methylation at new diagnosis were correlated with high level of minimal residual disease (MRD) before consolidation therapy (P = 0.011). In the 34 children with MRD >/= 10(-4) at the end of induction remission, the relapse rate of high methylation patients was significantly higher than that of low methylation patients (8/16 vs 3/18)(P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: The abnormal hypermethylation of the two CpG sites (at -1189 and -1176) of the promoter of the CASP8AP2 gene is possibly associated with leukemogenesis in childhood ALL. The treatment outcome is more poor in patients with hypermethylation than that in patients with low methylation. The combination of the methylation level of the two CpG sites and MRD level at the end induction remission is able to predict relapse more effectively.","['Liu, Fei-Fei', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Wang, Kai-Ling', 'Li, Wei-Jing', 'Deng, Guo-Ren', 'Gao, Chao', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Wu, Min-Yuan', 'Cui, Lei', 'Li, Zhi-Gang']","['Liu FF', 'Liu X', 'Wang KL', 'Li WJ', 'Deng GR', 'Gao C', 'Zhao XX', 'Wu MY', 'Cui L', 'Li ZG']","[""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94101, USA.', ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematologic Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; Beijing 100045, China.

Over the last few years, clinical and experimental data suggest there are two paths for the origin of leukemia stem cells: from a transformed hematopoietic stem cell or progenitor. The mechanisms of leukemia stem cell formation and clonal evolution were elucidated. Sub-clonal mutations and clonal architectures in leukemia were studied and a mosaic evolution pattern is described. Random evolution or non-inherited mutations of leukemia cells would accelerate the progression of malignant disease.

Among the miRNAs first identified to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, the miR-181 family has been implicated in regulating the differentiation of B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells during normal hematopoiesis, and has been linked tightly to the pathogenesis and prognosis of AML. Accumulating evidence indicates that miR-181 acts as a tumor suppressor in the pathogenesis of AML and exhibits a significant impact on the survival of patients with AML.

In conclusion, having an HLA-identical sibling donor was not associated with a better outcome in patients with ALL aged 50-70 years.","['Barba, Pere', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Olga, Garcia', 'Esquirol, Albert', 'Gil-Cortes, Cristina', 'Gonzalez, Jose', 'Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'Valcarcel, David', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Duarte, Rafael F', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Ribera, Josep Maria']","['Barba P', 'Martino R', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Olga G', 'Esquirol A', 'Gil-Cortes C', 'Gonzalez J', 'Fernandez-Aviles F', 'Valcarcel D', 'Guardia R', 'Duarte RF', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Abella E', 'Montesinos P', 'Ribera JM']","[""a Department of Hematology , Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron-Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain."", 'b Department of Hematology , Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau , Barcelona , Spain.', 'c Department of Hematology , Hospital Universitario La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'd Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Jose Carreras Research Institute , Badalona , Spain.', 'b Department of Hematology , Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau , Barcelona , Spain.', 'e Department of Hematology , Hospital General , Alicante , Spain.', 'f Department of Hematology , Hospital Virgen del Rocio , Sevilla , Spain.', 'g Department of Hematology , Hospital Clinic , Barcelona , Spain.', ""a Department of Hematology , Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron-Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain."", 'h Department of Hematology , Hospital Josep Trueta , Girona , Spain.', 'i Department of Hematology , Hospital Duran i Reynals, Hospitalet de Llobregat , Spain.', 'j Department of Hematology , IBSAL, IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC and Hospital Universitario Salamanca , Salamanca , Spain.', 'k Department of Hematology , Hospital del Mar , Barcelona , Spain ; for the Programa Espanol de Tratamientos en Hematologia (PETHEMA) group.', 'c Department of Hematology , Hospital Universitario La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'd Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Jose Carreras Research Institute , Badalona , Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150306,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', '*Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1014365 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(10):2812-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1014365.

Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.","['Pemovska, Tea', 'Johnson, Eric', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Repasky, Gretchen A', 'Chen, Jeffrey', 'Wells, Peter', 'Cronin, Ciaran N', 'McTigue, Michele', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Murray, Brion W', 'Wennerberg, Krister']","['Pemovska T', 'Johnson E', 'Kontro M', 'Repasky GA', 'Chen J', 'Wells P', 'Cronin CN', 'McTigue M', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Porkka K', 'Murray BW', 'Wennerberg K']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.', 'La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Worldwide Research &Development, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.', 'La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Worldwide Research &Development, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Worldwide Research &Development, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Worldwide Research &Development, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Worldwide Research &Development, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.', 'La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Worldwide Research &Development, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150209,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'C9LVQ0YUXG (Axitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KDR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Axitinib', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Indazoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2015/03/27 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['nature14119 [pii]', '10.1038/nature14119 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2015 Mar 5;519(7541):102-5. doi: 10.1038/nature14119.

Mounting evidence indicates that obesity has a negative impact on fertility. Yet, the link between adipose tissue biology and infertility remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the communication between the adipose tissue and the reproductive system and the importance of this cross talk for the development of a receptive endometrium. To that end, we generated an in vitro model with endometrial and adipocyte cell lines. Sexual hormones, progesterone and estradiol, were used to decidualize endometrial cells and sensitize adipocytes. Decidualization produced a simultaneous increase of adipokine receptors in endometrial cells paralleling changes in their receptivity status. Furthermore, sensitization of 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased mRNA levels of leptin and resistin and decreased the expression of adiponectin and chemerin levels. This was accompanied by increased isoproterenol-induced lipolysis and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Lastly, conditioned culture medium of those sensitized adipocytes was used to feed endometrial cells. This treatment resulted in (i) upregulation of genes previously identified as positive regulators of endometrial receptivity, such as leukemia inhibitory factor and glutathione peroxidase 3, and (ii) downregulation of interleukin-15 and mucin1, both genes negatively related with endometrial receptivity. Our results indicate that the endocrine communication between adipose tissue and the reproductive system is bidirectional and stress the importance of the adipose tissue to modulate the reproductive fitness.","['Gamundi-Segura, Silvia', 'Serna, Jose', 'Oehninger, Sergio', 'Horcajadas, Jose A', 'Arbones-Mainar, Jose M']","['Gamundi-Segura S', 'Serna J', 'Oehninger S', 'Horcajadas JA', 'Arbones-Mainar JM']","['Adipocyte and Fat Biology Laboratory (AdipoFat), Unidad de Investigacion Traslacional, Instituto Aragones de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150217,Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Receptors, Adipokine)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/etiology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Obesity/complications/*metabolism', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Receptors, Adipokine/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/18 06:00,2016/05/28 06:00,['2015/02/18 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13105-015-0393-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2015 Sep;71(3):537-46. doi: 10.1007/s13105-015-0393-0.

NCs bind strongly to nucleic acids (NAs) and promote NA aggregation by virtue of their cationic nature; they also destabilize the NA duplex via highly structured zinc-binding motifs. Thus, they are considered to be NA chaperones. While most retroviral NCs are structurally similar, differences are observed both within and between retroviral genera. In this work, we compare the NA binding and chaperone activity of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) NC to that of two other retroviral NCs: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) NC, which is structurally similar to BLV NC but from a different retrovirus genus, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) NC, which possesses several key structural differences from BLV NC but is from the same genus. Our data show that BLV and HIV-1 NCs bind to NAs with stronger affinity in relation to HTLV-1 NC, and that they also accelerate the annealing of complementary stem-loop structures to a greater extent. Analysis of kinetic parameters derived from the annealing data suggests that while all three NCs stimulate annealing by a two-step mechanism as previously reported, the relative contributions of each step to the overall annealing equilibrium are conserved between BLV and HIV-1 NCs but are different for HTLV-1 NC. It is concluded that while BLV and HTLV-1 belong to the same genus of retroviruses, processes that rely on NC may not be directly comparable.","['Qualley, Dominic F', 'Sokolove, Victoria L', 'Ross, James L']","['Qualley DF', 'Sokolove VL', 'Ross JL']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Berry College, Mt.

The aim of this study was to investigate the immune modulatory effect of SoSa I on TLR2- and TLR4-induced inflammation within the monocytic MUTZ-3-cell model. MUTZ-3 cells were stimulated with gram-negative (Escherichia coli) or gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria or bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS or peptidoglycans (PGN) alone or in combination with SoSa I. Cell morphology was characterized by raster scanning and light microscopy. Cytokine production (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IP-10, RANTES and IL-8) was measured by cytometric bead array and the expression of surface markers was assessed by flow cytometry. MUTZ-3 cells revealed a cell maturation-like alteration in morphology and increased expression of CD80, CD86, TLR2 and TLR4 after stimulation with either gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria or bacterial PAMPs. The addition of SoSa I suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretions in a dose-dependent manner regardless of TLR2 or TLR4 stimulation. Interestingly, E. coli- and S. aureus-induced inflammation was always inhibited better by SoSa I than that induced by LPS and PGN. Additionally, SoSa I reduced the expression of CD86 in PGN- or LPS-stimulated cells. This study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory capacity of SoSa I is based on influencing both monocytic TLR2 and TLR4 and that SoSa I inhibits more effectively whole bacteria compared to solely LPS or PGN what points to a broader role of SoSa I in the down-regulation of inflammation.","['Fussbroich, Daniela', 'Schubert, Ralf', 'Schneider, Petra', 'Zielen, Stefan', 'Beermann, Christopher']","['Fussbroich D', 'Schubert R', 'Schneider P', 'Zielen S', 'Beermann C']","['Department of Food Technology, University of Applied Sciences, Leipziger Str. 123, Fulda, Germany. daniela.fussbroich@lt.hs-fulda.de.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '51330-27-9 (soyasaponin I)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'B7-2 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Chemokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Endotoxins/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/agonists/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2015/02/17 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4fo01065e [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2015 Mar;6(3):1001-10. doi: 10.1039/c4fo01065e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also explore the variation of the level of organization in the gene network with cancer progression. We find that this variation is non-monotonic, which implies the fitness landscape in the evolution of AML cancer cells is non-trivial.

In this study, we analyzed the presence of CYP3A4-A-290G polymorphism in 77 newly diagnosed AML cases and 72 healthy control using PCR/RFLP aiming to show CYP3A4-A-290G polymorphism pattern in acute myeloid leukemia patients, and its role in disease severity and progression.

Also, the study aimed to detect any mutation in these three genes among IVF pregnant and non-pregnant women versus control menstrual blood of fertile women. Endometrial tissue biopsies were taken from 15 women undergoing IVF on the day of oocyte retrieval. The quantitative expression of IL-11, IL-11Ralpha, and LIF genes was assessed by real-time PCR and PCR products were sequenced. Menstrual blood from 10 fertile women was used as control to compare the DNA sequence versus DNA sequence of the studied genes in endometrial biopsies. LH, FSH, and E2 were assessed for enrolled patients by ELISA. Endometrial thickness was also assessed by pelvic ultrasonography. No significant difference was detected between quantitative expression of the three studied genes and pregnancy IVF outcome. Although DNA sequence changes were found in IL-11 and LIF genes of women with negative pregnancy IVF outcome compared to women with positive pregnancy IVF outcome, no DNA sequence changes were detected for IL-11Ralpha. Other studied parameters (e.g., age, LH, FSH, E2, and endometrial thickness) showed no significant differences or correlation of quantitative expression of the three studied involved genes. Data suggested that there were no significant differences between quantitative expression of IL-11, IL-11Ralpha, and LIF genes and the IVF pregnancy outcome.

Emissions from these industries affect local air quality and human health. This paper characterizes ambient levels of 77 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the region using high-precision measurements collected in summer 2010. Remarkably strong enhancements of 43 VOCs were detected, and concentrations in the industrial plumes were often similar to or even higher than levels measured in some of the world's largest cities and industrial regions. For example maximum levels of propene and i-pentane exceeded 100 ppbv, and 1,3-butadiene, a known carcinogen, reached 27 ppbv. Major VOC sources included propene fractionation, diluent separation and bitumen processing. Emissions of the measured VOCs increased the hydroxyl radical reactivity (kOH), a measure of the potential to form downwind ozone, from 3.4 s(-1) in background air to 62 s(-1) in the most concentrated plumes. The plume value was comparable to polluted megacity values, and acetaldehyde, propene and 1,3-butadiene contributed over half of the plume kOH. Based on a 13-year record (1994-2006) at the county level, the incidence of male hematopoietic cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) was higher in communities closest to the Industrial Heartland compared to neighboring counties. While a causal association between these cancers and exposure to industrial emissions cannot be confirmed, this pattern and the elevated VOC levels warrant actions to reduce emissions of known carcinogens, including benzene and 1,3-butadiene.","['Simpson, Isobel J', 'Marrero, Josette E', 'Batterman, Stuart', 'Meinardi, Simone', 'Barletta, Barbara', 'Blake, Donald R']","['Simpson IJ', 'Marrero JE', 'Batterman S', 'Meinardi S', 'Barletta B', 'Blake DR']","['Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.', 'Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.', 'Dept. of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.', 'Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.', 'Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Atmos Environ (1994),"Atmospheric environment (Oxford, England : 1994)",9888534,,,,PMC4326008,2013/12/01 00:00,2013/12/01 00:01,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.09.017 [doi]'],ppublish,Atmos Environ (1994). 2013 Dec 1;81:702-709. doi: 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.09.017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alberta', 'Emissions', 'Hematopoietic cancer', 'Industrial Heartland', 'Volatile organic compounds']",['P30 ES017885/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS656970'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It is more common in developed world than in developing countries. The rational of this study was to determine the clinico-hematological profile in Pakistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cross sectional study, sixty patients with CLL were enrolled from January 2011 to June 2013. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 21. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.0+/-9.2 years (range 40-82) and the male to female ratio was 2.1:1. Peak age group was 60-70 years (38.3%) and 18.3% were under 50 years old. Major complaints were weakness (51.7%), fever (18.3%) and abdominal discomfort (13.3%). Main clinical findings were splenomegaly (46.6%), lymphadenopathy (36.6%) and pallor (26.7%). Some 16.7% were diagnosed incidentally. The mean hemoglobin was 10.8+/-2.4 g/dl, with a total leukocyte count of 91.5+/-87.8x10(9)/l and platelets 197.8+/-103.2x10(9)/l. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 26.7% and 21.7% of cases, respectively. High LDH and hyperuricemia were detected in 15% each and elevated serum creatinine was seen in 11.6%. According to Rai staging 11.6% were in stage 0, 13.3% stage 1, 26.7% each for stage II and stage III while 21.7% patients were in stage IV.

Berger induces caspase-dependent apoptosis at least partly through activation of p38 MAPK pathway in U937 human leukemic cells.,465-9,,"BACKGROUND: Orostachys japonicus A. Berger (A. Berger) is commonly used as a folk remedy for cancer therapy. However, the mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity are poorly investigated in human cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether flavonoids extracted from Orostachys japonicus A. Berger (FEOJ) might have anticancer effects in human leukemia cells, focusing on cell death mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U937 human leukemic cancer cells were used. RESULTS: FEOJ induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in human U937 cancer cells. Flow cytometry revealed significant accumulation of cells with sub-G1 DNA content at the concentrations of 200 mug/mL and 400 mug/mL. FEOJ-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, DeltaPsim) in human U937 cancer cells, which might be associated with suppression of Bcl-2 and XIAP proteins. FEOJ induced the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, playing at least in part an important role in FEOJ-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that FEOJ may induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in human leukemic cells by regulating MMP (DeltaPsim) through suppressing Bcl-2 and X-IAP.

More data need to be gathered and published particularly in developing countries to better understand the scale of the problem. AIMS: This study aimed to describe the patterns of childhood cancers in Saudi Arabia over a period of ten years (1999-2008). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive retrospective study was based on secondary data from the Saudi Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2008. All Saudi cases (both genders), under the age of 15 years, who were diagnosed with cancer during the study period, were included in this study. RESULTS: Childhood cancer in Saudi Arabia, in the period between 1999 and 2008, accounted for about 8% of total cancer cases. The most common encountered cancers were leukemia (34.1%), followed by lymphoma (15.2%), brain (12.4%), and kidney cancers (5.3%). The overall incidence of childhood cancers increased from 8.8 per 100,000 in 1999 to 9.8 per 100,000 in 2008. The incidence rates of cancers per 100,000 in the years 1999 and 2008 were generally higher among males, (9.4 and 11.5 in males vs. 8.3 and 8.1 in females). The highest incidence rate in the surveyed years was apparent in the birth to age 4 years group.

We sought to explore the cytotoxic effect and mechanism of quinacrine action in human leukemia K562 cells. Quinacrine induced K562 cell apoptosis accompanied with ROS generation, mitochondrial depolarization, and down-regulation of BCL2L1 and BCL2. Upon exposure to quinacrine, ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation were observed in K562 cells. Quinacrine-induced cell death and mitochondrial depolarization were suppressed by the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and constitutively active MEK1 over-expression. Activation of p38 MAPK was shown to promote BCL2 degradation. Further, ERK inactivation suppressed c-Jun-mediated transcriptional expression of BCL2L1. Over-expression of BCL2L1 and BCL2 attenuated quinacrine-evoked mitochondrial depolarization and rescued the viability of quinacrine-treated cells. Taken together, our data indicate that quinacrine-induced K562 cell apoptosis is mediated through mitochondrial alterations triggered by p38 MAPK-mediated BCL2 down-regulation and suppression of ERK/c-Jun-mediated BCL2L1 expression.","['Changchien, Jung-Jung', 'Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Cheng, Tian-Lu', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Changchien JJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Huang CH', 'Cheng TL', 'Lin SR', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.

On the other hand recent reports implicate abnormal tyrosine kinase signaling in beta-cell death in Type I and Type II diabetes. In this work we determined the effects of GNF-2, GNF-5 on pancreatic beta-cell death caused by streptozotocin (STZ). STZ treatment causes apoptosis of INS-1 cells by activation of intracellular ROS, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), caspase 3, and caspase 3-dependent activation of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta). GNF-2 and GNF-5 increased cell viability and attenuated STZ-induced intracellular ROS and significantly reduced the activation of JNK, caspase 3, and caspase 3-dependent activation of PKCdelta. In studies with intact mice, GFN-2 and GNF-5 prevented the loss of beta cells and the increase in blood glucose produced by STZ-treated control mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GNF-2 and GNF-5 increased insulin protein levels in STZ-treated mice when compared with control mice. These findings suggest that non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors provide a new approach for the treatment of new-onset Type I and Type II diabetes.","['Karunakaran, Udayakumar', 'Park, Si Jun', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Sim, Taebo', 'Park, Keun-Gyu', 'Kim, Myoung Ok', 'Lee, In Kyu']","['Karunakaran U', 'Park SJ', 'Jun do Y', 'Sim T', 'Park KG', 'Kim MO', 'Lee IK']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea; Departments of Internal Medicine, Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Animal BT Science and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Center for Laboratory Animal Resources, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Leading-edge Research Center for Drug Discovery and Development for Diabetes and Metabolic Disease, Kyungpook National University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Life Sciences Research Division, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea; Leading-edge Research Center for Drug Discovery and Development for Diabetes and Metabolic Disease, Kyungpook National University Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea; Research Institute of Aging and Metabolism, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Animal BT Science and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Center for Laboratory Animal Resources, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.

FISH subsets were compared using the median del11q FISH% (>58%, high vs. </=58%, low). Overall survival (OS) and time to first treatment (TTFT) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots (log rank). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the association between FISH% of del11q and outcomes. Patients with sole del11q were similar to del11q with del13q in terms of TTFT and OS. Patients with high FISH% of del11q had significantly shorter OS and TTFT as compared with patients with low FISH%, particularly in sole del11q; this negative impact of high FISH% of del11q on OS and TTFT was diminished with coexistent del13q. In multivariate analysis, high FISH% of del11q was a significant predictor for shorter OS and TTFT. A comparison of these del11q subsets with a separate cohort of (n = 673) previously untreated patients with sole del13q showed that the high FISH% del11q cohort had a significantly shorter TTFT and OS. In addition, bulky disease by physical examination or computed tomography imaging was infrequent at presentation in patients with del11q. High FISH% of del11q can reliably discriminate higher risk patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Presence of coexistent del13q should be accounted for while prognosticating patients with del11q.","['Jain, Preetesh', 'Keating, Michael', 'Thompson, Phillip A', 'Trinh, Long', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Wierda, William', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Burger, Jan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Jain P', 'Keating M', 'Thompson PA', 'Trinh L', 'Wang X', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Burger J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estrov Z', 'Abruzzo L', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150330,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",PMC4521389,2015/02/17 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23978 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jun;90(6):471-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23978.

This leads to redistribution of cPML into the cytoplasm, where it coordinates phosphorylation and activation of Smad2 by the TGF-beta receptor. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acquisition of PML-RARalpha is known to impede critical aspects of TGF-beta signaling, including myeloid differentiation. Although these defects are thought to rely on suppression of cPML activity, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain enigmatic. Here, we find that an abnormal function of PML-RARalpha is to interfere with TGIF breakdown, presumably by competing with PHRF1 for binding to TGIF, culminating in cPML sequestration and inactivation. Enforcing PHRF1 activity is sufficient to restore TGF-beta cytostatic signaling in human blasts and suppress APL formation in a mouse model of APL, providing proof-of-concept data that suppression of PHRF1 activity by PML-RARalpha represents a critical determinant in APL pathogenesis.","['Prunier, Celine', 'Zhang, Ming-Zhu', 'Kumar, Santosh', 'Levy, Laurence', 'Ferrigno, Olivier', 'Tzivion, Guri', 'Atfi, Azeddine']","['Prunier C', 'Zhang MZ', 'Kumar S', 'Levy L', 'Ferrigno O', 'Tzivion G', 'Atfi A']","['Laboratory of Cell Signaling and Carcinogenesis, INSERM UMRS938, 184 Rue du Faubourg St-Antoine, 75571 Paris, France.', 'Department of Oral Medicine, Infection and Immunity, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, 188 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 N.

It is generally believed that both electrostatic interactions and sized based mechanical entrapment contribute to virus clearance by depth filtration. In order to establish whether the effectiveness of virus clearance correlates with the charge characteristics of a given depth filter, a counter-ion displacement technique was employed to determine the ionic capacity for several depth filters. Two depth filters (Millipore B1HC and X0HC) with significant differences in ionic capacities were selected and evaluated for their ability to eliminate viruses. The high ionic capacity X0HC filter showed complete porcine parvovirus (PPV) clearance (eliminating the spiked viruses to below the limit of detection) under low conductivity conditions (</=2.5 mS/cm), achieving a log10 reduction factor (LRF) of > 4.8. On the other hand, the low ionic capacity B1HC filter achieved only approximately 2.1-3.0 LRF of PPV clearance under the same conditions. These results indicate that parvovirus clearance by these two depth filters are mainly achieved via electrostatic interactions between the filters and PPV. When much larger xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMuLV) was used as the model virus, complete retrovirus clearance was obtained under all conditions evaluated for both depth filters, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms other than just electrostatic interactions in XMuLV clearance.","['Venkiteshwaran, Adith', 'Fogle, Jace', 'Patnaik, Purbasa', 'Kowle, Ron', 'Chen, Dayue']","['Venkiteshwaran A', 'Fogle J', 'Patnaik P', 'Kowle R', 'Chen D']","['Dept. of Bioproduct Research, Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, DC3941 Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150304,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Filtration/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Parvovirus, Porcine', 'Static Electricity', 'Swine', 'Viruses/*isolation & purification', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus']",,2015/02/17 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/btpr.2061 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2015 Mar-Apr;31(2):431-7. doi: 10.1002/btpr.2061.

This work aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antitumoral activities of the A. chica aqueous (AE) and ethanol (EE) extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The murine sponge model was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic activities of AE and EE. Accumulation of neutrophil and macrophage in the implants were determined by assaying myeloperoxidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activities and the neovascularization evaluated by the amount of hemoglobin present in the implant using the Drabkin method. The antitumoral activity was evaluated using the MTT colorimetric method against Jurkat, HL60 and MCF-7 cells. Semi-purified fractions F1-F4 from the EE extract were obtained by a liquid-liquid solvent extraction method and their in vitro anti-proliferative effects were also investigated. RESULTS: Ethanol and aqueous extracts of A. chica decreased neutrophil accumulation and hemoglobin content in the sponge implants without altering the level of cytokines (IL-2, IL- 4, IL-5, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and VEGF) and the albumin/globulin ratio in the serum of treated animals. There was no sign of toxicity (clinical, laboratory or histopathology). The ethanol extract presented antiproliferative activity (IC50 21.5-36.3 microg/mL) against HL60 and Jurkat cell lineages and proapoptotic activity at 50 microg/mL in HL60 cells. The fraction F1 also demonstrated significant antiproliferative activity (IC50 38.5 microg/mL) and proapoptotic activity against HL60 cells in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous and ethanol extracts of A. chica attenuate the inflammatory and angiogenic components of the subcutaneous fibrovascular tissue induced by the synthetic matrix in mice. In addition, the ethanol extract from Arrabidaea chica and its fraction F1 presented in vitro antiproliferative activity and could be useful for developing potential chemopreventive substances.","['Michel, Ana Flavia Ribeiro Machado', 'Melo, Marilia Martins', 'Campos, Paula Peixoto', 'Oliveira, Maira Souza', 'Oliveira, Fabiano Aurelio Silva', 'Cassali, Geovanni Dantas', 'Ferraz, Vanny Perpetua', 'Cota, Betania Barros', 'Andrade, Silvia Passos', 'Souza-Fagundes, Elaine Maria']","['Michel AF', 'Melo MM', 'Campos PP', 'Oliveira MS', 'Oliveira FA', 'Cassali GD', 'Ferraz VP', 'Cota BB', 'Andrade SP', 'Souza-Fagundes EM']","['Departamento de Ciencias Agrarias e Ambientais - Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil.

Previously we identified the active site in the adiponectin protein, and generated both a nanomolar monomeric agonist of the adiponectin receptor (10-mer ADP355) and an antagonist (8-mer ADP400) to modulate various adiponectin receptor-mediated cellular functions. As physiologically circulating adiponectin forms multimeric complexes, we also generated an agonist dimer with improved biodistribution and in vitro efficacy. In the current report, we attempted to optimize the monomeric agonist structure. Neither extension of the peptide up to 14-mer analogs nor reinstallation of native residues in permissible positions enhanced significantly the activity profile. The only substitutions that resulted in 5-10-fold improved agonistic activity were the replacement of turn-forming Gly4 and Tyr7 residues with Pro and Hyp, respectively, yielding the more active native beta-sheet structure. All peptides retained good stability in human serum exhibiting half-lives >2 h. The cellular efficacy and stability rankings among the peptides followed expected structure-activity relationship trends. To investigate whether simultaneous activation of adiponectin pathways and inhibition of leptin-induced signals can result in cytostatic and anti-oncogenic signal transduction processes, we developed a chimera of the leptin receptor antagonist peptide Allo-aca (placed to the N-terminus) and ADP355 (at the C-terminus). The in vitro anti-tumor activity and intracellular signaling of the chimera were dominated by the more active Allo-aca component. The ADP355 part, however, reversed unfavorable in vivo metabolic effects of the leptin receptor antagonist.","['Otvos, Laszlo Jr', 'Kovalszky, Ilona', 'Olah, Julia', 'Coroniti, Roberta', 'Knappe, Daniel', 'Nollmann, Friederike I', 'Hoffmann, Ralf', 'Wade, John D', 'Lovas, Sandor', 'Surmacz, Eva']","['Otvos L Jr', 'Kovalszky I', 'Olah J', 'Coroniti R', 'Knappe D', 'Nollmann FI', 'Hoffmann R', 'Wade JD', 'Lovas S', 'Surmacz E']","['Department of Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19122.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19122.', 'Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Leipzig University, Leipzig, 04103, Germany.', 'Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Leipzig University, Leipzig, 04103, Germany.', 'Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Leipzig University, Leipzig, 04103, Germany.', 'Florey Neurosciences Institutes, University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, 68178.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19122.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['*Adiponectin/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,2015/02/17 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bip.22627 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2015 May;104(3):156-66. doi: 10.1002/bip.22627.,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['activity relationships', 'biodistribution', 'breast cancer', 'chimera', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'growth inhibition', 'ophthalmic cell models', 'proteolytic stability', 'structure']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term psychiatric sequelae and their main risk factors in this population were evaluated. PROCEDURE: Initially, 483 survivors of childhood cancer, except leukemia, were invited to complete a questionnaire assessing their health and quality of life. Of them, 130 completed the survey, subsequently consulted with a pediatric oncologist and an internist, and met with a psychologist for a semi-standardized interview based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), which allowed diagnosis of DSM-IV Axis 1 psychiatric disorders. The collected data were compared with those of the French general population. RESULTS: Seventy-three of the 130 survivors (56.2%) who completed the MINI interview reported experiencing at least one psychiatric disorder since cancer diagnosis, mostly anxiety (39.2%), mood (27.7%), or major depressive (24.6%) disorders; 46 reported at least one current disorder (35.4%). Agoraphobia (P = 0.02) and psychotic disorders were more common (P = 0.003) and general anxiety disorder less common (P < 0.001) among survivors than the general population. Most disorders correlated significantly with survivors' ratings of lower quality of life. Smoking, cancer type, and treatments significantly influenced the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent between the self-questionnaire and MINI interview responses, though time may have biased memory. Vulnerability to and high risk for developing DSM-IV Axis 1 psychiatric disorders of childhood cancer survivors can persist long after diagnosis and treatment. Thus, systematic and general psychological screening of survivors may facilitate long-term psychological restoration.","['Bagur, J', 'Massoubre, C', 'Casagranda, L', 'Faure-Conter, C', 'Trombert-Paviot, B', 'Berger, C']","['Bagur J', 'Massoubre C', 'Casagranda L', 'Faure-Conter C', 'Trombert-Paviot B', 'Berger C']","['Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150214,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Interview, Psychological', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/*psychology', 'Neoplasms/*complications/psychology', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,2015/02/17 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25425 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 May;62(5):847-53. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25425.

To determine the prevalence of occult B infection (OBI) in a population with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and management with universal prophylaxis (UP) in all patients undergoing chemoimmunotherapy or targeted prophylaxis (TP) in patients experiencing seroreversion during therapy, we analyzed 397 patients with CLL from our database. The prevalence of OBI in our patients with CLL was 8.6% (34 patients).

In this work, we found that patients with CLL had a higher expression of PD-1 transcript (PDCD1) than healthy volunteers (p < 0.0001). PDCD1 expression was comparable between CLL cells from accumulation (peripheral blood) and proliferation (bone marrow) disease compartments. In blood samples of patients with mutated IGHV genes PDCD1 expression was higher than with unmutated IGHV (p = 0.0299). We demonstrated that phosphorylation of SYK and LYN, key B-cell receptor signaling kinases, was independent of PD-1 expression in patients with CLL, while ZAP-70 phosphorylation in negative tyrosine residue 292 showed strong inverse correlation (r = - 0.8, p = 0.0019). No associations between five single nucleotide polymorphisms of PDCD1, their expressions and susceptibility to CLL were found. In conclusion, PD-1 might be an independent, universal marker of CLL cells and a part of their activated phenotype, and subsequently might modulate the function of ZAP-70.","['Grzywnowicz, Maciej', 'Karabon, Lidia', 'Karczmarczyk, Agnieszka', 'Zajac, Malgorzata', 'Skorka, Katarzyna', 'Zaleska, Joanna', 'Wlasiuk, Paulina', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Frydecka, Irena', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Grzywnowicz M', 'Karabon L', 'Karczmarczyk A', 'Zajac M', 'Skorka K', 'Zaleska J', 'Wlasiuk P', 'Chocholska S', 'Tomczak W', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Frydecka I', 'Giannopoulos K']","['a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'b Department of Experimental Therapy , Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Science , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'c Department of Hematooncology and BMT Unit , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'c Department of Hematooncology and BMT Unit , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'd Department of Clinical Immunology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'c Department of Hematooncology and BMT Unit , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'b Department of Experimental Therapy , Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Science , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'a Department of Experimental Hematooncology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.', 'c Department of Hematooncology and BMT Unit , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150314,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,2015/02/17 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1017820 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(10):2908-13. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1017820.

Although inhibiting global/gene-specific DNA methylation is widely accepted as a key mechanism behind DNMTI anti-tumor activity, other mechanisms are likely involved in DNMTI's action. Because telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays key roles in cancer through telomere elongation and telomere lengthening-independent activities, and TERT has been shown to confer chemo- or radio-resistance to cancer cells, we determine whether DNMTIs affect telomere function and whether TERT/telomerase interferes with their anti-cancer efficacy. We showed that 5-AZA induced DNA damage and telomere dysfunction in AML cell lines by demonstrating the presence of 53-BP1 foci and the co-localization of 53-BP1 foci with telomere signals, respectively. Telomere dysfunction was coupled with diminished TERT expression, shorter telomere and apoptosis in 5-AZA-treated cells. However, 5-AZA treatment did not lead to changes in the methylation status of subtelomere regions. Down-regulation of TERT expression similarly occurred in primary leukemic cells derived from AML patients exposed to 5-AZA. TERT over-expression significantly attenuated 5-AZA-mediated DNA damage, telomere dysfunction and apoptosis of AML cells. Collectively, 5-AZA mediates the down-regulation of TERT expression, and induces telomere dysfunction, which consequently exerts an anti-tumor activity.","['Zhang, Xiaolu', 'Li, Bingnan', 'de Jonge, Nick', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Xu, Dawei']","['Zhang X', 'Li B', 'de Jonge N', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Xu D']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Telomere/*drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC4467122,2015/02/17 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/02/17 06:00'],"['2014/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['2917 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2917 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 10;6(7):4888-900. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2917.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DNMT inhibitors', 'TERT', 'apoptosis', 'telomerase', 'telomere']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical characteristics, risk classification, prognostic factors and outcome of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the impact of category, cytopathology and cytogenetics, the three components of the ""Category Cytology Cytogenetics"" classification of pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome, on the outcome of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation associated with inherited bone marrow failure. We used data from the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry. Among 327 patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndrome enrolled in the registry, the estimated risk of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation by the age of 18 years was 37%. The risk of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation varied according to the type of inherited bone marrow failure syndrome but was highest in Fanconi anemia. The development of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation significantly affected overall survival. Mortality varied based on cytopathological group. The largest group of patients had refractory cytopenia. Clonal marrow cytogenetic abnormalities were identified in 87% of patients with clonal and malignant myeloid transformation, and different cytogenetic groups had different impacts on disease progression. We conclude that category, cytopathology and cytogenetics in cases of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes have an important impact on outcome and that the classification of such cases should incorporate these factors.","['Cada, Michaela', 'Segbefia, Catherin I', 'Klaassen, Robert', 'Fernandez, Conrad V', 'Yanofsky, Rochelle A', 'Wu, John', 'Pastore, Yves', 'Silva, Mariana', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Brossard, Josee', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Abish, Sharon', 'Steele, MacGregor', 'Sinha, Roona', 'Belletrutti, Mark', 'Breakey, Vicky', 'Jardine, Lawrence', 'Goodyear, Lisa', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Shago, Mary', 'Beyene, Joseph', 'Sharma, Preeti', 'Zlateska, Bozana', 'Dror, Yigal']","['Cada M', 'Segbefia CI', 'Klaassen R', 'Fernandez CV', 'Yanofsky RA', 'Wu J', 'Pastore Y', 'Silva M', 'Lipton JH', 'Brossard J', 'Michon B', 'Abish S', 'Steele M', 'Sinha R', 'Belletrutti M', 'Breakey V', 'Jardine L', 'Goodyear L', 'Sung L', 'Shago M', 'Beyene J', 'Sharma P', 'Zlateska B', 'Dror Y']","['Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics and the Genetics and Genome Biology Program, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics and the Genetics and Genome Biology Program, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', ""British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Hopital Ste.

PR104 is a phosphate ester that is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding alcohol PR-104A and further reduced to the amine and hydroxyl-amine nitrogen mustards that induce DNA cross-linking in hypoxic cells under low oxygen concentrations. In this phase I/II study, patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n=40) after 1 or 2 prior treatments or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=10) after any number of prior treatments received PR104; dose ranged from 1.1 to 4 g/m(2). The most common treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were myelosuppression (anemia 62%, neutropenia 50%, thrombocytopenia 46%), febrile neutropenia (40%), infection (24%), and enterocolitis (14%). Ten of 31 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (32%) and 2 of 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20%) who received 3 g/m(2) or 4 g/m(2) had a response (complete response, n=1; complete response without platelet recovery, n=5; morphological leukemia-free state, n=6). The extent of hypoxia was evaluated by the hypoxia tracer pimonidazole administered prior to a bone marrow biopsy and by immunohistochemical assessments of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha and carbonic anhydrase IX. A high fraction of leukemic cells expressed these markers, and PR104 administration resulted in measurable decrease of the proportions of hypoxic cells. These findings indicate that hypoxia is a prevalent feature of the leukemic microenvironment and that targeting hypoxia with hypoxia-activated prodrugs warrants further evaluation in acute leukemia.

Here, we present the 13-year follow up of our study. Fifty-four patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled: 39 (72%) with de novo disease, 6 (11%) whose disease was primary refractory after induction (without a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 9 (17%) in complete remission after one course of induction therapy (without tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Forty-two (93%) of the 45 patients treated for active disease achieved complete remission, one achieved complete remission with incomplete recovery of platelets, one achieved partial remission and one died during induction. Nineteen (35%) patients are alive and 18 are in complete remission. The 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 43%. Significant negative predictors of overall survival were age over 60 years, p190 molecular transcript, and active disease at enrollment. Sixteen (30%) patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median overall survival was not significantly greater for patients who underwent transplant. Patients with residual molecular disease at three months had improved complete remission duration with transplant. The median time to hematologic recovery and severe toxicities with combination were not significantly different from those observed with conventional chemotherapy. Only one patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity. HyperCVAD chemotherapy and imatinib is an effective regimen for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Transplant may not be indicated in all patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Here, in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients (n=75), widespread structural and functional natural killer cell defects were identified. One subgroup of patients (13%) had a selective deficiency of peripheral natural killer cells (count <10/mm(3) blood) with normal frequencies of T and natural killer-like T cells. Natural killer cell-deficient patients were predominantly found in high-risk subgroups and deficiency of these cells was significantly associated with poor prognosis. In the second subgroup, comprising the majority of patients (76%), natural killer cells were present but exhibited poor cytotoxicity. The defect was strongly associated with reduced levels of perforin and granzyme B. Notably, natural killer cell function and arming of cytotoxic granules could be fully reconstituted by in vitro stimulation. Further phenotypic analysis of these patients revealed an immature natural killer cell compartment that was biased towards CD56(bright) cells. The residual CD56(dim) cells exhibited a significant increase of the unlicensed NKG2A(-)KIR(-) subset and a striking reduction in complexity of the repertoire of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that the widespread defects in natural killer cell function occurring in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes are mostly due to either unsuccessful or inefficient generation of mature, functionally competent natural killer cells, which might contribute to disease progression through impaired immune surveillance.","['Hejazi, Maryam', 'Manser, Angela R', 'Frobel, Julia', 'Kundgen, Andrea', 'Zhao, Xiaoyi', 'Schonberg, Kathrin', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Uhrberg, Markus']","['Hejazi M', 'Manser AR', 'Frobel J', 'Kundgen A', 'Zhao X', 'Schonberg K', 'Germing U', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N', 'Uhrberg M']","['Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany Markus.Uhrberg@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150214,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*immunology/mortality', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",PMC4420213,2015/02/16 06:00,2015/10/23 06:00,['2015/02/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.118679 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.118679 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 May;100(5):643-52. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.118679.

Imatinib has contributed to complete and prolong cytogenetic responses so that it is now the standard treatment of CML. Recently, Imatinib mesylate has shown a significantly prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in metastatic and locally advanced c-Kit positive gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and more recently a prolonged disease-free survival in operated high risk GIST. Imatinib is a welltolerated treatment with few side effects mainly gastro-intestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), headaches, rash and periorbital edema. Hemorrhage incidents are rare in patients treated with Imatinib. They are more frequently seen in CML patients. Hemorrhage incidents in CML include in many cases upper gastro-intestinal (GI) tract bleeding and central nervous system bleeding in rare ones. In GIST patients treated with Imatinib, hemorrhage incidents are exclusively made of upper GI tract bleeding consecutive to tumor perforation or necrosis. In our observation, we present the case of a subdural hematoma occurring in a patient treated with adjuvant Imatinib for a high risk localized gastric GIST.

By current biomarkers, the majority of relapse patients is initially not identified indicating the need for prognostic and therapeutic targets reflecting leukemia biology. We previously described that rapid engraftment of patient ALL cells transplanted onto NOD/SCID mice (short time to leukemia, TTLshort) is indicative of early patient relapse. Gene expression profiling identified genes coding for molecules involved in mTOR signaling to be associated with TTLshort/early relapse leukemia. Here, we now functionally address mTOR signaling activity in primograft ALL samples and evaluate mTOR pathway inhibition as novel treatment strategy for high-risk ALL ex vivo and in vivo. By analysis of S6-phosphorylation downstream of mTOR, increased mTOR activation was found in TTLshort/high-risk ALL, which was effectively abrogated by mTOR inhibitors resulting in decreased leukemia proliferation and growth. In a preclinical setting treating individual patient-derived ALL in vivo, mTOR inhibition alone, and even more pronounced together with conventional remission induction therapy, significantly delayed post-treatment leukemia reoccurrence in TTLshort/high-risk ALL. Thus, the TTLshort phenotype is functionally characterized by hyperactivated mTOR signaling and can effectively be targeted ex vivo and in vivo providing a novel therapeutic strategy for high-risk ALL.","['Hasan, Md Nabiul', 'Queudeville, Manon', 'Trentin, Luca', 'Eckhoff, Sarah Mirjam', 'Bronzini, Ilaria', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Barth, Thomas', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Meyer, Luder Hinrich']","['Hasan MN', 'Queudeville M', 'Trentin L', 'Eckhoff SM', 'Bronzini I', 'Palmi C', 'Barth T', 'Cazzaniga G', 'te Kronnie G', 'Debatin KM', 'Meyer LH']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Institute for Pathology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4359301,2015/02/16 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2842 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2842 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jan 30;6(3):1382-95. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2842.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several new highly efficacious and well-tolerated small molecules targeting the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway and Bcl-2 have been approved or are in the late stages of development. These new agents are altering therapeutic paradigms in CLL, but unlike with alloHCT, information on long-term disease control is lacking.

CD43 plays an important role in the development of many diseases, and coexpression of CD43 and CD20 on peripheral B cells is a predictive factor of hematopoietic malignancy. Although CD43 is expressed in approximately 25% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), its prognostic significance remains unclear. To analyze CD43 expression in DLBCL, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS), and assess its prognostic value, we analyzed clinical data from 160 patients with DLBCL, NOS. We observed that CD43 expression was detected in 47 (29.4%) of 160 cases. CD43 expression was positively correlated with old age (>60 years), high serum lactate dehydrogenase level, B symptoms, non-germinal center type, and DLBCL, NOS, mortality. Patients with CD43-positive DLBCL, NOS, had poorer overall survival (P < .001, log-rank test) and event-free survival (P < .001, log-rank test) than CD43-negative patients. Univariate analysis showed that CD43 expression, age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, International Prognostic Index category, and germinal center phenotype were prognostic factors for DLBCL, NOS, patient survival. Multivariate analysis showed that CD43 expression was an independent significant prognostic factor for event-free survival (P < .001) and overall survival (P < .001). Based on these data, we conclude that CD43 expression is a novel adverse prognostic factor for patients with DLBCL, NOS.","['Ma, Xiao-Bo', 'Zheng, Yan', 'Yuan, He-Pei', 'Jiang, Jing', 'Wang, Yin-Ping']","['Ma XB', 'Zheng Y', 'Yuan HP', 'Jiang J', 'Wang YP']","['Department of Pathology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.

In this study, combining Raman spectroscopic data, principal component analysis (PCA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, both the biochemical changes and morphological changes during TPL-induced cell apoptosis were presented. In contrast, the corresponding data during Daunorubicin (DNR)-induced cell apoptosis was also exhibited. The obtained results showed that Raman spectral changes during TPL-induced cell apoptosis were greatly different from DNR-induced cell apoptosis in the early stage of apoptosis but revealed the high similarity in the late stage of apoptosis. Moreover, above Raman spectral changes were respectively consistent with the morphological changes of different stages during TPL-induced apoptosis or DNR-induced apoptosis, including membrane shrinkage and blebbing, chromatin condensation and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, it was found that Raman spectral changes with TPL-induced apoptosis or DNR-induced apoptosis were respectively related with the cell cycle G1 phase arrest or G1 and S phase arrest.","['Zhang, Daosen', 'Feng, Yanyan', 'Zhang, Qinnan', 'Su, Xin', 'Lu, Xiaoxu', 'Liu, Shengde', 'Zhong, Liyun']","['Zhang D', 'Feng Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Su X', 'Lu X', 'Liu S', 'Zhong L']","['Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.

The precise role that lncRNA expression plays in the pathogenesis of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is unknown. Therefore, unbiased microarray profiling was performed on human B-ALL specimens, and it was determined that lncRNA expression correlates with cytogenetic abnormalities, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR in a large set of B-ALL cases. Importantly, high expression of BALR-2 correlated with poor overall survival and diminished response to prednisone treatment. In line with a function for this lncRNA in regulating cell survival, BALR-2 knockdown led to reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to prednisolone treatment. Conversely, overexpression of BALR-2 led to increased cell growth and resistance to prednisone treatment. Interestingly, BALR-2 expression was repressed by prednisolone treatment and its knockdown led to upregulation of the glucocorticoid response pathway in both human and mouse B cells. Together, these findings indicate that BALR-2 plays a functional role in the pathogenesis and/or clinical responsiveness of B-ALL, and that altering the levels of particular lncRNAs may provide a future direction for therapeutic development. IMPLICATIONS: lncRNA expression has the potential to segregate the common subtypes of B-ALL, predict the cytogenetic subtype, and indicate prognosis.","['Fernando, Thilini R', 'Rodriguez-Malave, Norma I', 'Waters, Ella V', 'Yan, Weihong', 'Casero, David', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Rao, Dinesh S']","['Fernando TR', 'Rodriguez-Malave NI', 'Waters EV', 'Yan W', 'Casero D', 'Basso G', 'Pigazzi M', 'Rao DS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.

Common childhood malignancies include leukemias (commonest, 30-40%), brain tumors (20%) and lymphoma (12%) followed by neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and tumors arising from soft tissues, bones and gonads. Leukemias, the commonest childhood cancer, arise from clonal proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic cells leading to disruption of normal marrow function and marrow failure. The various clinical manifestations of leukemia result from unregulated proliferation of the malignant clone and bone marrow failure. There are two main subtypes, the commoner, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A small proportion may have chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). A systematic approach is necessary for diagnosis. Treatment should be initiated as early as possible to avoid complications. A timely referral to a cancer center must be done if facilities for diagnosis/treatment, management of complications and provision for supportive care are not available at the treating center.","['Seth, Rachna', 'Singh, Amitabh']","['Seth R', 'Singh A']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029, India, drrachnaseth@yahoo.co.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150215,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/therapy']",,2015/02/15 06:00,2016/03/18 06:00,['2015/02/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12098-015-1695-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12098-015-1695-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2015 Sep;82(9):817-24. doi: 10.1007/s12098-015-1695-5.

These inconsistencies could be due to overlooking the effects of related confounding risk-factors and comorbidities. METHODS: The plasma lipid profiles of acute-leukemia and control groups were compared. RESULTS: We observed that acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients display significantly higher triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins, whereas, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients display significantly lower high-density lipoproteins. To assess the confounding effects of related risk factors gender-, age- and BMI-based analyses were performed. We observed that the aforementioned significant differences in the lipid profiles of leukemia patients were restricted to female participants of the respective groups. Moreover, a significant decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels was observed only in male participants of the AML population. Various age-specific trends in plasma lipid profile of the leukemia patients were also observed. BMI-based analysis did not display many significant differences from the overall analyses. In addition to comparing the absolute values of plasma lipids in leukemia and control groups we also compared and observed significant differences in prevalence of various isolated- and mixed-dyslipidemias in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help in outlining the prevalence and types of dyslipidemia in leukemia patients that may emerge as diagnostic/prognostic factors for the management of acute leukemia.","['Usman, Hina', 'Rashid, Rida', 'Ameer, Fatima', 'Iqbal, Areeb', 'Zaid, Muhammad', 'Hasnain, Shahida', 'Kalbacher, Hubert', 'Zaidi, Nousheen']","['Usman H', 'Rashid R', 'Ameer F', 'Iqbal A', 'Zaid M', 'Hasnain S', 'Kalbacher H', 'Zaidi N']","['Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'Medical and Natural Sciences Research Centre, University of Tubingen, Germany.', 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.

METHODS: Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were selected to start this new model of care. Four characteristics were taken into account for the choice: chronicity of the disease, frequency of doctor visits, pharmaceutical care value and conservation of tyronsine kinase inhibitors medicines at room temperature. RESULTS: Out of 68 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and treated with tyronsine kinase inhibitors, 42 were selected due to the frequency of their hematologist visits. An introductory letter and a questionnaire about their preferences were sent to these patients.Sixteen of them expressed their desire to participate. The legal department designed a confidentiality contract, as well as a model of informed consent. A logistic distribution model based on defined routes and timetables was established. Prior to inclusion, pharmaceutical care was performed in a face to face consultation and the communication way was established for the followings remote consultations. Home delivery had a monthly cost of 13.2 euro (including VAT) per patient. All the patients who started this program continue in it. To date, 5 deliveries per patient have been conducted. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to establish an alternative model of pharmaceutical care with home delivery of medication, keeping the pharmacist-patient relationship, avoiding travel, ensuring the confidentiality and rationalizing the stocks.","['San Jose Ruiz, Begona', 'Gil Lemus, Maria Angeles', 'Figuero Echeverria, Maria Puy']","['San Jose Ruiz B', 'Gil Lemus MA', 'Figuero Echeverria MP']","['Servicio de Farmacia.

OBJECTIVE: To study the ocular manifestations of childhood acute leukemia among the children attending a tertiary-level hospital in Nepal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was undertaken at the B.P. Koirala Lions Centre for Ophthalmic Studies (BPKLCOS) and Kanti Children Hospital (KCH), Kathmandu, over a period of one-and-a-half years. Children diagnosed with acute childhood leukemia referred to the BPKLCOS from the Oncology Unit of the KCH and the Emergency Department of the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) were included in the study, using a non-probability sampling method. RESULTS: Of the 71 cases with childhood acute leukemia, 55 (77.5%; 95% CI = 66% - 85%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL)whereas the other 16 (23%) had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Ocular involvement were seen in 33 cases (46%) and were more frequent in cases of AML as compared to those with ALL (p=0.001, OR 5.0, 95% CI= 1.4 - 17.5). Direct ocular involvement and secondary ocular involvement were observed in 12 (16.9%) and 29 (40.8%) subjects, respectively. Ocular symptoms were present in only 11 cases (15.49%). Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow examination in cases with direct ocular involvement showed 10 cases (83.3%) positive for blast cells in the CSF and 6 cases (50%) positive for blast cells in bone marrow. The most common secondary manifestation was retinal haemorrhage, seen in 23 cases (32.4%). CONCLUSION: In view of the high asymptomatic ocular involvement and the significant visual morbidity, a routine ophthalmic examination is recommended as an integral part of the medical examination in all cases of childhood acute leukemia.","['Khadka, Deepak', 'Sharma, Ananda K', 'Shrestha, Jeevan K', 'Shrestha, Gauri S', 'Shrestha, Pun N', 'Pant, Suresh R', 'Pant, Bidya P']","['Khadka D', 'Sharma AK', 'Shrestha JK', 'Shrestha GS', 'Shrestha PN', 'Pant SR', 'Pant BP']","['Geta Eye Hospital, Dhangadhi, Kailali.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Nepal,Nepal J Ophthalmol,Nepalese journal of ophthalmology : a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of the Nepal Ophthalmic Society : NEPJOPH,101505288,,IM,"['Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Nepal/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Tertiary Care Centers']",,2015/02/15 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/02/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3126/nepjoph.v6i2.11678 [doi]'],ppublish,Nepal J Ophthalmol. 2014 Jul-Dec;6(2):197-204. doi: 10.3126/nepjoph.v6i2.11678.,['(c) NEPjOPH.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that AMF exerts antiproliferative effects on a variety of solid tumor cell lines. In this study we raised the question whether AMF could also substantially inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies such as leukemia or lymphoma. We found that AMF has antiproliferative effects on various hematologic cell lines derived from human leukemia and lymphoma. Additionally, we show that AMF induces apoptosis in leukemia cell lines not only via the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway, but also in a caspase-independent manner. This effect was found also in G0-arrested cells. Finally, in our animal experiments utilizing male nu/nu Balb/c mice we found a significant growth retardation, which was immunohistochemically associated with a significantly lower number of KI67-positive cells and caspase-3 induction in AMF-treated mice.","['Neuwirt, Hannes', 'Wabnig, Elisabeth', 'Feistritzer, Clemens', 'Eder, Iris E', 'Salvador, Christina', 'Puhr, Martin', 'Culig, Zoran', 'Massoner, Petra', 'Tiefenthaler, Martin', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Konwalinka, Guenther']","['Neuwirt H', 'Wabnig E', 'Feistritzer C', 'Eder IE', 'Salvador C', 'Puhr M', 'Culig Z', 'Massoner P', 'Tiefenthaler M', 'Steurer M', 'Konwalinka G']","['Department of Internal Medicine IV, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Experimental Urology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Experimental Urology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Experimental Urology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Experimental Urology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150213,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Akacid-medical-formulation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Guanidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4334520,2015/02/14 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0117806 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-28464 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 13;10(2):e0117806. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0117806. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We developed a national survey with the participation of 13 Spanish hospitals, and retrospectively reviewed (from 1990 to 2010) these subtypes of AML. Fifty-five patients were collected: 35 with AML inv(3)/t(3;3) and 20 with AML abn(3q). A data collecting page that included main features at diagnosis, therapeutic approach and response, and survival variables, was distributed and completed. RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in sex, age, history of myelodysplastic syndrome or chemo-/radiotherapy, clinical presentation, WBC and platelet counts, hemoglobin level, blasts immunophenotype, serum lactatedehydrogenase, peripheral blood and bone marrow cellular dysplasia, and bone marrow biopsy findings. Although the association with monosomy 7 was significantly more frequent in AML inv(3)/t(3;3), this did not seem to influence outcome. The lack of response to the different modalities of treatment and the aggressive course of the disease were the standard in both cohorts of patients. DISCUSSION: Although not yet recognized by the World Health Organization classification, our results are in agreement with the findings of other authors, who include both subsets of AML together in the same group of adverse prognosis. CONCLUSION: In an attempt to simplify and bound entities with similar genetic background and clinical behavior, it would be desirable to bring together both subgroups of AML in a single section.","['Raya, Jose Maria', 'Martin-Santos, Taida', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Sanzo, Carmen', 'Perez-Sirvent, Maria Luz', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Navarro, Jose Tomas', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Domingo, Alicia', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Diaz-Beva, Marina', 'Batlle, Ana', 'Gonzalez-de-Villambrosia, Sonia', 'Tuset, Esperanza', 'Vallespi, Teresa', 'Ortega, Margarita', 'Bermejo, Alfredo', 'Martin-Ramos, Marisa', 'Peri, Valeria', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Florensa, Lourdes']","['Raya JM', 'Martin-Santos T', 'Luno E', 'Sanzo C', 'Perez-Sirvent ML', 'Such E', 'Navarro JT', 'Milla F', 'Alonso E', 'Domingo A', 'Rozman M', 'Diaz-Beva M', 'Batlle A', 'Gonzalez-de-Villambrosia S', 'Tuset E', 'Vallespi T', 'Ortega M', 'Bermejo A', 'Martin-Ramos M', 'Peri V', 'Sole F', 'Florensa L']","['a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology Hospital Universitario de Canarias , Ofra s/n, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150213,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/02/14 06:01,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/14 06:01 [medline]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000003 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Sep;20(8):435-441. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000003.

Clinical presentation is varied, from mild fever to severe sepsis with invasive bacterial infection (IBI) or invasive fungal infection (IFI), with great impact on prognosis and patient mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of FN episodes in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL) or lymphoma (L), diagnosed and treated at the Hospital Clinico Universidad Catolica and Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio in Santiago from April 2010 to January 2012. RESULTS: 130 patients were included with 105 episodes of NF, with an incidence of 0.65 per 100 days of observation, higher in AL than L (1.31 vs 0.25, p = 0.001). Etiology or clinical focus was documented in 67 (63.8%) episodes, with IBI in 33 (31.4%) and IFI in 21 (20%) cases. Mortality related to infection occurred in 4 (6.2%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports that the FN incidence and frequency of IBI and IFI during episodes are higher in AL vs. L. It is necessary to evaluate the impact of interventions to reduce its incidence, including the benefit and risk of using antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups.","['Rabagliati, Ricardo', 'Bertin, Pablo', 'Ceron, Ines', 'Rojas, Hernan', 'Dominguez, Isabel', 'Vera, Alvaro', 'Sir, Leonardo', 'Flores, Jimena', 'Fernandez, Paulina', 'Perez, Marco', 'De La Cruz, Rolando']","['Rabagliati R', 'Bertin P', 'Ceron I', 'Rojas H', 'Dominguez I', 'Vera A', 'Sir L', 'Flores J', 'Fernandez P', 'Perez M', 'De La Cruz R']",,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Chile,Rev Chilena Infectol,Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,9305754,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*epidemiology', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Private', 'Hospitals, Public', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0716-10182014000600013 [pii]', '10.4067/S0716-10182014000600013 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chilena Infectol. 2014 Dec;31(6):721-8. doi: 10.4067/S0716-10182014000600013.,,,,,,,,,"Epidemiologia de neutropenia febril en pacientes adultos con leucemia aguda y linfoma: Estudio de cohorte en hospitales publico y privado de Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,

This coevolutionary signature, termed Evolutionary Rate Covariation (ERC), is calculated using only gene sequences from a set of closely related species and has demonstrated potential as a computational tool for inferring functional relationships between genes. To further define applications of ERC, we first established that roughly 55% of genetic diseases posses an ERC signature between their contributing genes. At a false discovery rate of 5% we report 40 such diseases including cancers, developmental disorders and mitochondrial diseases. Given these coevolutionary signatures between disease genes, we then assessed ERC's ability to prioritize known disease genes out of a list of unrelated candidates. We found that in the presence of an ERC signature, the true disease gene is effectively prioritized to the top 6% of candidates on average. We then apply this strategy to a melanoma-associated region on chromosome 1 and identify MCL1 as a potential causative gene. Furthermore, to gain global insight into disease mechanisms, we used ERC to predict molecular connections between 310 nominally distinct diseases. The resulting ""disease map"" network associates several diseases with related pathogenic mechanisms and unveils many novel relationships between clinically distinct diseases, such as between Hirschsprung's disease and melanoma. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of molecular evolution as a gene discovery platform and show that evolutionary signatures can be used to build informative gene-based networks.","['Priedigkeit, Nolan', 'Wolfe, Nicholas', 'Clark, Nathan L']","['Priedigkeit N', 'Wolfe N', 'Clark NL']","['Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150213,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Chromosomes/genetics', 'Computational Biology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Hirschsprung Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",PMC4334549,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1004967 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-14-01958 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2015 Feb 13;11(2):e1004967. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004967. eCollection 2015 Feb.,,,,"['P30 DK079307/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008208/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG008540/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many active phytochemicals are in human clinical trials and have been used for a long time, alone and in association with conventional anticancer drugs, for the treatment of various types of cancers. A great number of in vitro, in vivo and clinical reports document the multi-target anticancer activities of isothiocyanates and of compounds characterized by a naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide scaffold. In order to search for new anticancer agents with a better pharmaco-toxicological profile, we investigated hybrid compounds obtained by inserting isothiocyanate group(s) on a naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide scaffold. Moreover, since water-soluble fullerene derivatives can cross cell membranes thus favoring the delivery of anticancer therapeutics, we explored the cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of hybrid compounds conjugated with fullerene. We studied their cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line by using different flow cytometric assays. In order to better understand their pharmaco-toxicological potential, we also analyzed their genotoxicity. Our global results show that the synthesized compounds reduced significantly the viability of leukemia cells.

Conventional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually performed to assess mucormycosis extension, but they may present insufficiencies in their performance. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 13 years old patient with diagnosis of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (RCM) who performed head MRI and [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) both for the infection spread assessment and for the early evaluation of response to systemic amphotericin-B treatment. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that (18)F-FDG PET/CT could be considered as a valuable tool for the initial staging of RCM when compared with MRI and should be performed as soon as possible after the first clinical suspicion of this disease. In addition (18)F-FDG PET/CT may also be useful for the assessment of response to treatment.","['Altini, Corinna', 'Niccoli Asabella, Artor', 'Ferrari, Cristina', 'Rubini, Domenico', 'Dicuonzo, Franca', 'Rubini, Giuseppe']","['Altini C', 'Niccoli Asabella A', 'Ferrari C', 'Rubini D', 'Dicuonzo F', 'Rubini G']","['Nuclear Medicine Unit, D.I.M., University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Piazza Giulio Cesare 11, 70124 , Bari, Italy. artor.niccoliasabella@uniba.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150213,Greece,Hell J Nucl Med,Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,101257471,"['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Mucormycosis/*diagnostic imaging/therapy', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole Body Imaging']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['s002449910167 [pii]', '10.1967/s002449910167 [doi]']",ppublish,Hell J Nucl Med. 2015 Jan-Apr;18(1):68-70. doi: 10.1967/s002449910167.

This places an added burden on their quality of life that can last many years beyond diagnosis and treatment. In addition to the effect of the cancer itself, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can all contribute both short and long term to sleep disruption. Sleep disorders have also been associated with pain, fatigue, medication and hospitalisation in children suffering from cancer. This review will explore the relationship between childhood cancer and associated sleep disorders, in the acute stage of diagnosis, during treatment and in the years following. We will discuss the possible causes and the current treatment modalities used to treat sleep disorders in children with cancer, and in childhood cancer survivors. It has been estimated that the recent advances in treatment have improved the overall five year survival rate for all childhood cancers to over 80%, with some cancers achieving a near 100% cure rate such as early stage Wilms' tumour. Thus, recognition and appropriate treatment of associated sleep disorders is essential to optimise long term quality of life.","['Walter, Lisa M', 'Nixon, Gillian M', 'Davey, Margot J', 'Downie, Peter A', 'Horne, Rosemary S C']","['Walter LM', 'Nixon GM', 'Davey MJ', 'Downie PA', 'Horne RS']","['The Ritchie Centre, MIMR-PHI Institute of Medical Research, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Internal tandem duplication (ITD) and also point mutations affecting aspartic acid 835 (D835) are reported. A previous study demonstrated aberrant expression of CD7 on blasts in de novo AML cases with FLT3/ITD mutations. Our study goals are to expand the evaluation of this association to a larger group of patients; to evaluate the association of aberrant CD7 expression in AMLs with D835 mutation, not previously done; to evaluate if aberrant CD7 expression may serve as a surrogate marker for predicting FLT3 mutational status; to evaluate if combined FLT3 with NPM1 mutational status has a better correlation with CD7 expression. The FLT3 mutational analysis was performed on DNA extracted from 149 previously diagnosed AML cases with cytogenetics and flow cytometry evaluation available. Of 149 patients, 28 were positive for FLT3; CD7 was positive in 13 of 20 ITD-positive cases, 5 of 6 D835-positive cases, and 1 of 2 ITD/D835-positive cases. The association of CD7 positivity and FLT3 positivity was found to be significant. However, CD7 expression has a low positive predictive value of 30% and a negative predictive value of 90%. Because of the low positive predictive value, CD7 expression cannot be used as a surrogate marker for FLT3 positivity; even though the negative predictive value is higher, some cases that are FLT3 positive may be missed if CD7 expression would be used for screening.","['Baqai, Junaid', 'Crisan, Domnita']","['Baqai J', 'Crisan D']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Beaumont Health System, MI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PDM.0000000000000034 [doi]', '00129039-201502000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2015 Feb;23(2):104-8. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0000000000000034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small-molecule inhibitor of the aberrant transcription factor CBFbeta-SMMHC delays leukemia in mice.,779-84,10.1126/science.aaa0314 [doi],"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of adult leukemia. The transcription factor fusion CBFbeta-SMMHC (core binding factor beta and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16)(p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFbeta for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML. Current inv(16) AML treatment with nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a good initial response but limited long-term survival. Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFbeta-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1. AI-10-49 restores RUNX1 transcriptional activity, displays favorable pharmacokinetics, and delays leukemia progression in mice. Treatment of primary inv(16) AML patient blasts with AI-10-49 triggers selective cell death. These data suggest that direct inhibition of the oncogenic CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein may be an effective therapeutic approach for inv(16) AML, and they provide support for transcription factor targeted therapy in other cancers.","['Illendula, Anuradha', 'Pulikkan, John A', 'Zong, Hongliang', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Xue, Liting', 'Sen, Siddhartha', 'Zhou, Yunpeng', 'Boulton, Adam', 'Kuntimaddi, Aravinda', 'Gao, Yan', 'Rajewski, Roger A', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Castilla, Lucio H', 'Bushweller, John H']","['Illendula A', 'Pulikkan JA', 'Zong H', 'Grembecka J', 'Xue L', 'Sen S', 'Zhou Y', 'Boulton A', 'Kuntimaddi A', 'Gao Y', 'Rajewski RA', 'Guzman ML', 'Castilla LH', 'Bushweller JH']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA. jhb4v@virginia.edu Lucio.Castilla@umassmed.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA. jhb4v@virginia.edu Lucio.Castilla@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0', ""(2,2'-(5,5'-((oxybis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(oxy))bis(pyridine-5,2-diyl))bis(6-(trif"", 'luoromethoxy)-1H-benzo(d)imidazole))', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry']",PMC4423805,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/03/07 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['347/6223/779 [pii]', '10.1126/science.aaa0314 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2015 Feb 13;347(6223):779-84. doi: 10.1126/science.aaa0314.,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']",,,"['1 DP2 OD007399-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI039536/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM080186/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008136/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD007399/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS684224'],['Science. 2015 Feb 13;347(6223):713-4.

Here we show that morgana (+/-) mice spontaneously develop a lethal myeloproliferative disease resembling human atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), preceded by ROCK hyperactivation, centrosome amplification, and cytogenetic abnormalities in the bone marrow (BM). Moreover, we found that morgana is underexpressed in the BM of patients affected by atypical CML, a disorder of poorly understood molecular basis, characterized by nonrecurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. Morgana is also underexpressed in the BM of a portion of patients affected by Philadelphia-positive CML (Ph(+) CML) caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene, and in this condition, morgana underexpression predicts a worse response to imatinib, the standard treatment for Ph(+) CML. Thus, morgana acts as an oncosuppressor with different modalities: (1) Morgana underexpression induces centrosome amplification and cytogenetic abnormalities, and (2) in Ph(+) CML, it synergizes with BCR-ABL signaling, reducing the efficacy of imatinib treatment. Importantly, ROCK inhibition in the BM of patients underexpressing morgana restored the efficacy of imatinib to induce apoptosis, suggesting that ROCK inhibitors, combined with imatinib treatment, can overcome suboptimal responses in patients in which morgana is underexpressed.","['Di Savino, Augusta', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Rocca, Stefania', 'Familiari, Ubaldo', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Crivellaro, Sabrina', 'Carra, Giovanna', 'Ferretti, Roberta', 'Fusella, Federica', 'Giugliano, Emilia', 'Camporeale, Annalisa', 'Franco, Irene', 'Miniscalco, Barbara', 'Cutrin, Juan Carlos', 'Turco, Emilia', 'Silengo, Lorenzo', 'Hirsch, Emilio', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Papotti, Mauro', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Tarone, Guido', 'Morotti, Alessandro', 'Brancaccio, Mara']","['Di Savino A', 'Panuzzo C', 'Rocca S', 'Familiari U', 'Piazza R', 'Crivellaro S', 'Carra G', 'Ferretti R', 'Fusella F', 'Giugliano E', 'Camporeale A', 'Franco I', 'Miniscalco B', 'Cutrin JC', 'Turco E', 'Silengo L', 'Hirsch E', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Papotti M', 'Saglio G', 'Tarone G', 'Morotti A', 'Brancaccio M']","['Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and.', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Oncology, University of Torino at St Luigi Hospital, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy;', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy;', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and.', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy;', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, Clinical Section, Grugliasco, Italy;

Recent studies have documented the power of microarrays to screen genome-wide for copy number aberrations (CNAs) and regions of copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) that are not detectable by G-banding or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These studies have involved application of a single array platform for the respective cases. The present investigation demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of integrating array results from multiple laboratories (ARUP, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and University of Minnesota Medical Center) that utilize different array platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent, or Illumina) in their respective clinical settings. A total of 65 patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) study AALL08B1 were identified for study, as cytogenetic and FISH studies had also been performed on these patients, with a central review of those results available for comparison. Microarray data were first analyzed by the individual laboratories with their respective software systems; raw data files were then centrally validated using NEXUS software. The results demonstrated the added value of integrating multi-platform data with cytogenetic and FISH data and highlight novel findings identified by array including the co-occurrence of low and high risk abnormalities not previously reported to coexist within a clone, novel regions of chromosomal amplification, clones characterized by numerous whole chromosome LOH that do not meet criteria for doubling of a near-haploid, and characterization of array profiles associated with an IKZF1 deletion. Each of these findings raises questions that are clinically relevant to risk stratification.","['Baughn, Linda B', 'Biegel, Jaclyn A', 'South, Sarah T', 'Smolarek, Teresa A', 'Volkert, Suzanne', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Loh, Mignon', 'Hirsch, Betsy']","['Baughn LB', 'Biegel JA', 'South ST', 'Smolarek TA', 'Volkert S', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Rabin KR', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Loh M', 'Hirsch B']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'ARUP Laboratories, Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', ""Division of Human Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.

The complex biology and aggressive nature of childhood leukemia, coupled with the relatively small patient population available for study, pose specific challenges to the development of new therapies. In this review, the authors discuss strategies and initiatives designed to improve access to new agents in the treatment of pediatric leukemia.","['Sun, Weili', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Sun W', 'Gaynon PS', 'Sposto R', 'Wayne AS']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20150211,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Pediatrics', 'Young Adult']",PMC4457598,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29267 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jun 15;121(12):1927-36. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29267.

During the photon-to-electricity conversion in PEC processes, electron-hole (charge) separation competes with electron-hole recombination, and the net effect essentially determines the performance of PEC biosensors. Herein, we propose a new approach for slowing down electron-hole recombination to increase charge separation efficiency for PEC biosensor development. Through doping with Mn(2+) , a pair of d bands ((4) T1 and (6) A1 ) is inserted between the conduction and valence bands of CdS QDs, which alters the electron-hole separation and recombination dynamics, allowing the generation of long-lived charge carriers with ms-scale lifetime that decay about 10(4) -10(5) -fold more slowly than in the case of undoped QDs. Photocurrent tests indicated that Mn(2+) doping resulted in an approximately 80 % increase in photocurrent generation compared with undoped CdS QDs. For application, the Mn-doped CdS QDs were coated on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode and functionalized with a cell surface carbohydrate-specific ligand (3-aminophenylboronic acid). In this way, a sensitive cytosensor for K562 leukemia cells was constructed. Moreover, the sugar-specific binding property of 3-aminophenylboronic acid allowed the electrode to serve as a switch for the capture and release of cells. This has been further explored with a view to developing a reusable PEC cytosensing platform.","['Wu, Peng', 'Pan, Jian-Bing', 'Li, Xiang-Ling', 'Hou, Xiandeng', 'Xu, Jing-Juan', 'Chen, Hong-Yuan']","['Wu P', 'Pan JB', 'Li XL', 'Hou X', 'Xu JJ', 'Chen HY']","['State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093 (China); Analytical & Testing Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064 (China).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150212,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,"['0 (Cadmium Compounds)', '0 (Sulfides)', '057EZR4Z7Q (cadmium sulfide)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)']",IM,"['Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Cadmium Compounds/*chemistry', 'Manganese/*chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Photochemical Processes', 'Quantum Dots/*chemistry', 'Sulfides/*chemistry']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/chem.201405798 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2015 Mar 23;21(13):5129-35. doi: 10.1002/chem.201405798.

We applied this approach to current treatments for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Data search was conducted in PubMed and websites of regulatory agencies (year 2000 through present time). Our analysis included randomized controlled trials assessing treatments for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The endpoint of the analysis was the rate of progression-free survival at 3 years. At least two reviewers abstracted study data and outcomes. Agents examined for their relative effectiveness included four monotherapies (chlorambucil, fludarabine, bendamustine, alemtuzumab) and four combination treatments (cyclophosphamide + fludarabine, cyclophosphamide + cladribine, cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab, cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + alemtuzumab). A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to comparatively evaluate these treatments. Nine trials (3620 patients) were included in the analysis. Odds ratio (with 95 % credible intervals) was estimated for all direct and indirect comparisons. Combinations treatments were found to be significantly more effective than single-agent treatments. Ranking in effectiveness was as follows: (1) cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab, (2) alemtuzumab, (3) cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + alemtuzumab, (4) cyclophosphamide + fludarabine and (at same ranking) cyclophosphamide + cladribine, (6) fludarabine, (7) bendamustine and (8) chlorambucil. Bendamustine fared worse in our analysis than in its pivotal trial. Overall, the estimated rankings appeared to be robust according to probabilistic analysis. Numerous indirect comparisons were assessed in the absence of RCTs. In conclusion, we generated an updated synthesis of the effectiveness of these treatments and we ranked them according to a Bayesian probabilistic model. In our probabilistic analysis, cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab ranked first in the base case while the worst-case scenario of this analysis placed this treatment at a remarkable second place.","['Messori, Andrea', 'Fadda, Valeria', 'Maratea, Dario', 'Trippoli, Sabrina']","['Messori A', 'Fadda V', 'Maratea D', 'Trippoli S']","['HTA Unit, ESTAV Toscana Centro, Regional Health Service, 50100, Firenze, Italy, andrea.messori.it@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20150214,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods', '*Statistics as Topic/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2310-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):1003-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2310-6.

Point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are observed as primary mutations or are acquired as secondary mutations in FLT3 with internal tandem duplications (ITDs) after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although dozens of potent inhibitors against FLT3 ITD have been reported, activating TKD point mutations, especially at residues F691 and D835, remain the leading cause for therapy resistance, highlighting the consistent need for new potent inhibitors. Herein we report the identification and characterization of novel quinoxaline-based FLT3 inhibitors. We used the pharmacophore features of diverse known inhibitors as a starting point for a new optimization algorithm for type II TKIs, starting from an in silico library pharmacophore search and induced-fit docking in the known FLT3 structure. This led to the design of a set of diverse quinoxalinebisarylureas, which were profiled in an FLT3 kinase activity assay. The most promising compounds were further evaluated in a zebrafish embryo phenotype assay.","['Goring, Stefan', 'Bensinger, Dennis', 'Naumann, Eva C', 'Schmidt, Boris']","['Goring S', 'Bensinger D', 'Naumann EC', 'Schmidt B']","['Clemens Schopf-Institute of Organic Chemistry & Biochemistry, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, 64287 Darmstadt (Germany).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150210,Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quinoxalines/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Zebrafish', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cmdc.201402477 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2015 Mar;10(3):511-22. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201402477.

The pathogenesis of ID remains unclear. High numbers of peripheral blood CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been reported in ATLL and HAM/TSP. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the status of Tregs, unknown to date, and the histopathological features of ID. METHODS: We studied 16 skin biopsies from 15 Peruvian adults and children with ID by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Histopathological patterns were seborrheic dermatitis-like and lichenoid. Intraepidermal lymphocytes were conspicuous. The infiltrate was composed of a CD3+ T cell infiltrate with a predominance of CD8+ over CD4+ cells. CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ Tregs were rare and their numbers were significantly lower than those reported in other inflammatory dermatoses. CONCLUSION: Tregs have an essential role in maintaining immune homeostasis of skin. Treg dysregulation ends in severe clinical manifestations. The clinical presentation of ID, with lesions resembling those seen in patients with atopic dermatitis and with mutations in the FoxP3 gene, is in agreement with a common Treg-deficient skin environment in these disorders, possibly secondary to HTLV-1 infection.","['Torres-Cabala, Carlos A', 'Curry, Jonathan L', 'Li Ning Tapia, Elsa Ml', 'Ramos, Cesar', 'Tetzlaff, Michael T', 'Prieto, Victor G', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Bravo, Francisco']","['Torres-Cabala CA', 'Curry JL', 'Li Ning Tapia EM', 'Ramos C', 'Tetzlaff MT', 'Prieto VG', 'Miranda RN', 'Bravo F']","['Departments of Pathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Dermatology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

The advantage of HSCT over other treatment comes from retrospective studies and the aim of the current study was to prospectively test this hypothesis, analyzing in particular patients from the pre-transplant period to avoid the selection bias of performing transplantation. This study was conducted to compare overall survival in MDS patients candidates to transplantation according to donor availability. The majority of patients (76%) received a treatment with DMA after registration, 69% had a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor, 70% of whom were transplanted. Baseline patient and disease characteristics were similar according to donor availability. Four-year overall survival was significantly better in patients with an HLA matched donor (37%) compared to patients without donor (15%). There was also evidence that this overall survival advantage was because of transplantation. Mortality risk was decreased after transplantation but it became significant only after the second year post transplant, because of early transplant-related mortality. Our results appear to justify, in higher risk MDS, a transplantation approach in all potential candidates who have an HLA identical donor.","['Robin, M', 'Porcher, R', 'Ades, L', 'Raffoux, E', 'Michallet, M', 'Francois, S', 'Cahn, J-Y', 'Delmer, A', 'Wattel, E', 'Vigouroux, S', 'Bay, J-O', 'Cornillon, J', 'Huynh, A', 'Nguyen, S', 'Rubio, M-T', 'Vincent, L', 'Maillard, N', 'Charbonnier, A', 'de Latour, R P', 'Reman, O', 'Dombret, H', 'Fenaux, P', 'Socie, G']","['Robin M', 'Porcher R', 'Ades L', 'Raffoux E', 'Michallet M', 'Francois S', 'Cahn JY', 'Delmer A', 'Wattel E', 'Vigouroux S', 'Bay JO', 'Cornillon J', 'Huynh A', 'Nguyen S', 'Rubio MT', 'Vincent L', 'Maillard N', 'Charbonnier A', 'de Latour RP', 'Reman O', 'Dombret H', 'Fenaux P', 'Socie G']","['1] Hematologie - Transplantation; Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France [2] University Paris VII, Denis Diderot, Paris, France [3] Inserm U 1160, Paris, France.', ""1] Team METHODS, Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Research Centre UMR 1153, Inserm, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France [2] AP-HP, Hopital Hotel-Dieu, Centre d'Epidemiologie Clinique, Paris, France."", 'Hematologie senior, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis and Hopital Avicenne, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie adulte, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Lyon, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU,UMR 5525 CNRS-UJF, Grenoble, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Reims, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Lyon, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Bordeaux, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Hematologie, Institut de Cancerologie de la Loire, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematologie, hopital de La Pitie Salpetriere Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie, hopital Saint-Antoine, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Montpellier, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Poitiers, France.', 'Hematologie CHU, Amiens, France.', '1] Hematologie - Transplantation; Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France [2] University Paris VII, Denis Diderot, Paris, France [3] Inserm U 1160, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie CHU, Caen, France.', '1] University Paris VII, Denis Diderot, Paris, France [2] Hematologie senior, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis and Hopital Avicenne, Paris, France.', '1] University Paris VII, Denis Diderot, Paris, France [2] Hematologie senior, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis and Hopital Avicenne, Paris, France.', '1] Hematologie - Transplantation; Assistance Publique Hopitaux de paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France [2] University Paris VII, Denis Diderot, Paris, France [3] Inserm U 1160, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201537 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.37 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1496-501. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.37.

Sapacitabine is a novel orally administered nucleoside analogue that has shown encouraging activity in unrandomised early-stage trials. We randomised 143 untreated patients with AML or with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (>10% marrow blasts) between sapacitibine and low-dose ara-C (LDAC) in our 'Pick a Winner' trial design. At the planned interim analysis there was no difference between LDAC and sapacitibine in terms of remission rate (CR/CRi, 27% vs 16% hazard ratio (HR) 1.98(0.90-4.39) P=0.09), relapse-free survival (10% vs 14% at 2 years, HR 0.73(0.33-1.61) P=0.4) or overall survival (OS; 12% vs 11% at 2 years, HR 1.24(0.86-1.78) P=0.2). Sapacitibine was well tolerated, apart from more grade 3/4 diarrhoea. On the basis of these findings sapacitibine did not show sufficient evidence of benefit over LDAC for the trial to be continued.","['Burnett, A K', 'Russell, N', 'Hills, R K', 'Panoskaltsis, N', 'Khwaja, A', 'Hemmaway, C', 'Cahalin, P', 'Clark, R E', 'Milligan, D']","['Burnett AK', 'Russell N', 'Hills RK', 'Panoskaltsis N', 'Khwaja A', 'Hemmaway C', 'Cahalin P', 'Clark RE', 'Milligan D']","['Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, UK.', 'University College London Hospitals, 1st Floor Central, London, UK.', ""Queen's Hospital, Rom Valley Way, Romford, UK."", 'Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Prescot St, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20150213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'W335P73C3L (sapacitabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201538 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1312-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.38.

With the advent of second-generation TKI safety and efficacy issues have gained interest. The randomized CML - Study IV was used for a long-term evaluation of imatinib (IM). 1503 patients have received IM, 1379 IM monotherapy. After a median observation of 7.1 years, 965 patients (64%) still received IM. At 10 years, progression-free survival was 82%, overall survival 84%, 59% achieved MR(5), 72% MR(4.5), 81% MR(4), 89% major molecular remission and 92% MR(2) (molecular equivalent to complete cytogenetic remission). All response levels were reached faster with IM800 mg except MR(5). Eight-year probabilities of adverse drug reactions (ADR) were 76%, of grades 3-4 22%, of non-hematologic 73%, and of hematologic 28%. More ADR were observed with IM800 mg and IM400 mg plus interferon alpha (IFN). Most patients had their first ADR early with decreasing frequency later on. No new late toxicity was observed. ADR to IM are frequent, but mostly mild and manageable, also with IM 800 mg and IM 400 mg+IFN. The deep molecular response rates indicate that most patients are candidates for IM discontinuation. After 10 years, IM continues to be an excellent initial choice for most patients with CML.","['Kalmanti, L', 'Saussele, S', 'Lauseker, M', 'Muller, M C', 'Dietz, C T', 'Heinrich, L', 'Hanfstein, B', 'Proetel, U', 'Fabarius, A', 'Krause, S W', 'Rinaldetti, S', 'Dengler, J', 'Falge, C', 'Oppliger-Leibundgut, E', 'Burchert, A', 'Neubauer, A', 'Kanz, L', 'Stegelmann, F', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Spiekermann, K', 'Scheid, C', 'Pfirrmann, M', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Hasford, J', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Kalmanti L', 'Saussele S', 'Lauseker M', 'Muller MC', 'Dietz CT', 'Heinrich L', 'Hanfstein B', 'Proetel U', 'Fabarius A', 'Krause SW', 'Rinaldetti S', 'Dengler J', 'Falge C', 'Oppliger-Leibundgut E', 'Burchert A', 'Neubauer A', 'Kanz L', 'Stegelmann F', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Spiekermann K', 'Scheid C', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hasford J', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

ATM is frequently inactivated in human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including ~50% of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) characterized by ectopic expression of CyclinD1. Here we report that early and robust deletion of ATM in precursor/progenitor B cells causes cell autonomous, clonal mature B-cell lymphomas of both pre- and post-germinal center (GC) origins. Unexpectedly, naive B-cell-specific deletion of ATM is not sufficient to induce lymphomas in mice, highlighting the important tumor suppressor function of ATM in immature B cells. Although EmuCyclinD1 is not sufficient to induce lymphomas, EmuCyclinD1 accelerates the kinetics and increases the incidence of clonal lymphomas in ATM-deficient B-cells and skews the lymphomas toward pre-GC-derived small lymphocytic neoplasms, sharing morphological features of human MCL. This is in part due to CyclinD1-driven expansion of ATM-deficient naive B cells with genomic instability, which promotes the deletions of additional tumor suppressor genes (i.e. Trp53, Mll2, Rb1 and Cdkn2a). Together these findings define a synergistic function of ATM and CyclinD1 in pre-GC B-cell proliferation and lymphomagenesis and provide a prototypic animal model to study the pathogenesis of human MCL.","['Yamamoto, K', 'Lee, B J', 'Li, C', 'Dubois, R L', 'Hobeika, E', 'Bhagat, G', 'Zha, S']","['Yamamoto K', 'Lee BJ', 'Li C', 'Dubois RL', 'Hobeika E', 'Bhagat G', 'Zha S']","['1] Institute for Cancer Genetics, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Graduate Program for Pathobiology and Molecular Medicine, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', '1] Centre for Biological Signaling Studies BIOSS, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] Department of Molecular Immunology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg and Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', '1] Institute for Cancer Genetics, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [3] Department of Pediatrics, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genomic Instability', 'Germinal Center/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphopenia/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5282516,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201541 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.41 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1414-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.41.

OAEMZLs are monoclonal tumors expressing a biased repertoire of mutated surface immunoglobulins. Antigenic activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) may have a role in the pathogenesis of these lymphomas. We have analyzed the reactivity of recombinant OAEMZL immunoglobulins. OAEMZL antibodies reacted with self-human antigens, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, HEp-2 immunofluorescence and human protein microarrays. All the analyzed recombinant antibodies (rAbs) exhibited polyreactivity by comprehensive protein array antibody reactivity and some rAbs also demonstrated rheumatoid factor activity. The identity of several reactive antigens was confirmed by microcapillary reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The tested rAbs frequently reacted with shared intracellular and extracellular self-antigens (for example, galectin-3). Furthermore, these self-antigens induced BCR signaling in B cells expressing cognate surface immunoglobulins derived from OAEMZLs. These findings indicate that interactions between self-antigens and cognate OAEMZL tumor-derived BCRs are functional, inducing intracellular signaling. Overall, our findings suggest that self-antigen-induced BCR stimulation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of C. psittaci-negative OAEMZLs.","['Zhu, D', 'Bhatt, S', 'Lu, X', 'Guo, F', 'Veelken, H', 'Hsu, D K', 'Liu, F-T', 'Alvarez Cubela, S', 'Kunkalla, K', 'Vega, F', 'Chapman-Fredricks, J R', 'Lossos, I S']","['Zhu D', 'Bhatt S', 'Lu X', 'Guo F', 'Veelken H', 'Hsu DK', 'Liu FT', 'Alvarez Cubela S', 'Kunkalla K', 'Vega F', 'Chapman-Fredricks JR', 'Lossos IS']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL, USA [2] Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA.', '1] Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA [2] Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC [3] Graduate Institute of Immunology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL, USA [2] Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Autoantigens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Chlamydophila psittaci', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Eye Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Psittacosis/microbiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201539 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.39 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1587-99. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.39.

Roughly 20% of MDS are therapy related (t-MDS), and this is considered an independent adverse prognostic factor. AREAS COVERED: This review based on a comprehensive literature search provides an overview on the main features of t-MDS, including its epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, prognostic classifications and therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Increasing evidence points out that the most important event in t-MDS is genetic alterations in hematopoietic stem precursor cells, however, ineffective hematopoiesis may also result from abnormalities in the bone marrow microenvironment. Thus, novel views onto the processes of t-MDS are needed such as the osteohematology concept. On the other hand, the number of people living with and beyond cancer is increasing worldwide; thus, most emphasis should be placed on preventing secondary malignancies such as t-MDS. From this review, it becomes clear that we are in urgent need not only to deepen our understanding of the leukemogenesis mechanisms induced by exposure to chemotherapy and radiation but also to translate this knowledge into clinical strategies aimed at risk reduction.","['Candelaria, Myrna', 'Duenas-Gonzalez, Alfonso']","['Candelaria M', 'Duenas-Gonzalez A']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico , Ave. San Fernando 22, Seccion XVI, Tlalpan, Mexico City , Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150212,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2015.1014340 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2015 May;14(5):655-65. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2015.1014340.

This approach combines the specificity of antibody therapy, the expanded response of cellular therapy and the memory activity of vaccine therapy. Recent clinical trials of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed toward CD19 as a stand-alone therapy have shown sustained complete responses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As these drug products are individually derived from a patient's own cells, a different manufacturing approach is required for this kind of personalized therapy compared with conventional drugs. Key steps in the CAR T-cell manufacturing process include the selection and activation of isolated T cells, transduction of T cells to express CARs, ex vivo expansion of modified T cells and cryopreservation in infusible media. In this review, the steps involved in isolating, genetically modifying and scaling-out the CAR T cells for use in a clinical setting are described in the context of in-process and release testing and regulatory standards.","['Levine, B L']",['Levine BL'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150213,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Performance-Enhancing Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Performance-Enhancing Substances/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,2015/02/14 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt20155 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2015.5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2015 Mar;22(2):79-84. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2015.5.

However, treatment failures and relapses are common and new markers are needed to identify patients with poor prognosis in prospective trials. The p16(INK4A)/CDK4-6/pRb pathway and telomerase activity, which are implicated in cell activation and aging, were analyzed to identify new prognostic markers. Proteins of the p16(INK4A)/CDK4-6/pRb pathway and telomerase activity were analyzed in 123 adult B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cases included in the GRAALL/GRAAPH trials. We found a significantly increased expression of p16(INK4A) in BCP-ALLs with MLL rearrangement. Telomerase activity was significantly lower in Philadelphia chromosome-negative/IKAROS-deleted (BCR-ABL1(-)/IKAROS(del)) cases compared to Philadelphia chromosome-positive (BCR-ABL1+) BCP-ALLs. In BCR-ABL1+ ALLs, high CDK4 expression, phosphorylated pRb (p-pRb) and telomerase activity were significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival (EFS). Enhanced p16(INK4A) expression was only related to a significantly shorter DFS. In vitro analyses of normal stimulated lymphocytes after short- and long-term cultures demonstrated that the observed protein variations of poor prognosis in BCR-ABL1+ ALLs may be related to cell activation but not to cell aging. For these patients, our findings argue for the development of therapeutic strategies including the addition of new lymphocyte activation inhibitors to current treatments.","['Chien, Wei W', 'Catallo, Regine', 'Chebel, Amel', 'Baranger, Laurence', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Gerland, Luc M', 'Schmidt, Aline', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Klein, Nathalie', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Larosa, Fabrice', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Chassevent, Agnes', 'Ffrench, Martine']","['Chien WW', 'Catallo R', 'Chebel A', 'Baranger L', 'Thomas X', 'Bene MC', 'Gerland LM', 'Schmidt A', 'Beldjord K', 'Klein N', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Leguay T', 'Huguet F', 'Larosa F', 'Hayette S', 'Plesa A', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H', 'Salles G', 'Chassevent A', 'Ffrench M']","['Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, CNRS UMR 5239 ENS - HCL, Lyon-Sud Medicine Faculty, Lyon, France.', 'Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, CNRS UMR 5239 ENS - HCL, Lyon-Sud Medicine Faculty, Lyon, France.', 'Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, CNRS UMR 5239 ENS - HCL, Lyon-Sud Medicine Faculty, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, CHU, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, CNRS UMR 5239 ENS - HCL, Lyon-Sud Medicine Faculty, Lyon, France; Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, CNRS UMR 5239 ENS - HCL, Lyon-Sud Medicine Faculty, Lyon, France; Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.

Proper transcriptional control to establish the genetic programs characteristic of each cellular stage is essential for the correct development of B lymphocytes. Deregulation of these particular transcriptional programs may result in a block in B-cell maturation, contributing to the development of hematological malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma. However, very little is currently known about the role of transcriptional repressors in normal and aberrant B lymphopoiesis. Here we report that histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is underexpressed in pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pro-B-ALL) and Burkitt lymphoma. Ectopic expression of HDAC7 induces apoptosis, leads to the downregulation of c-Myc and inhibits the oncogenic potential of cells in vivo, in a xenograft model. Most significantly, we have observed low levels of HDAC7 expression in B-ALL patient samples, which is correlated with the increased levels of c-Myc. From a mechanistic angle, we show that ectopically expressed HDAC7 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor C (MEF2C) and the corepressors HDAC3 and SMRT. Accordingly, both the HDAC7-MEF2C interaction domain as well as its catalytic domain are involved in the reduced cell viability induced by HDAC7. We conclude that HDAC7 has a potent anti-oncogenic effect on specific B-cell malignancies, indicating that its deregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Barneda-Zahonero, B', 'Collazo, O', 'Azagra, A', 'Fernandez-Duran, I', 'Serra-Musach, J', 'Islam, A B M M K', 'Vega-Garcia, N', 'Malatesta, R', 'Camos, M', 'Gomez, A', 'Roman-Gonzalez, L', 'Vidal, A', 'Lopez-Bigas, N', 'Villanueva, A', 'Esteller, M', 'Parra, M']","['Barneda-Zahonero B', 'Collazo O', 'Azagra A', 'Fernandez-Duran I', 'Serra-Musach J', 'Islam AB', 'Vega-Garcia N', 'Malatesta R', 'Camos M', 'Gomez A', 'Roman-Gonzalez L', 'Vidal A', 'Lopez-Bigas N', 'Villanueva A', 'Esteller M', 'Parra M']","[""Cellular Differentiation Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cellular Differentiation Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cellular Differentiation Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cellular Differentiation Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Breast Cancer and Systems Biology Unit, Translational Research Laboratory, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO), Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via s/n km 2.7, 08907 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cellular Differentiation Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Bellvitge, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Research Unit on Biomedical Informatics, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Dr Aiguader 88, 08003 Barcelona, Spain [2] Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Translational Research Laboratory, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""1] Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain [2] Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain [3] Department of Physiological Sciences II, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cellular Differentiation Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research institute (IDIBELL), Avenida Gran Via 199, 08908 L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150212,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cellular Reprogramming Techniques', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4669785,2015/02/13 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014594 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.594 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Feb 12;6:e1635. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.594.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The national registry-based case-control study, ESTELLE, was carried out in France in 2010-2011. Population controls were frequency matched with cases on age and gender. The participation rates were 93% for cases and 86% for controls. Data were obtained from structured telephone questionnaires administered to mothers. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for age, gender, and potential confounders. RESULTS: In all, 617 ALL and 1225 controls aged 1 year were included. Inverse associations between ALL and early common infections (OR=0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6, 1.0), non-first born (3 vs 1; OR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.0), attendance of a day-care centre before age 1 year (OR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.0), breastfeeding (OR=0.8, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.0), and regular contact with pets (OR=0.8, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.0) in infancy were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that conditions promoting the maturation of the immune system in infancy have a protective role with respect to ALL.","['Ajrouche, R', 'Rudant, J', 'Orsi, L', 'Petit, A', 'Baruchel, A', 'Lambilliotte, A', 'Gambart, M', 'Michel, G', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Ducassou, S', 'Gandemer, V', 'Paillard, C', 'Saumet, L', 'Blin, N', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Ajrouche R', 'Rudant J', 'Orsi L', 'Petit A', 'Baruchel A', 'Lambilliotte A', 'Gambart M', 'Michel G', 'Bertrand Y', 'Ducassou S', 'Gandemer V', 'Paillard C', 'Saumet L', 'Blin N', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['1] Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers, CRESS, INSERM U1153, Villejuif, France [2] Paris-Sud University, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', '1] Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers, CRESS, INSERM U1153, Villejuif, France [2] Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France [3] RNHE-National Registry of Childhood Hematopoietic Malignancies, Villejuif, France.', '1] Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers, CRESS, INSERM U1153, Villejuif, France [2] Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.', '1] AP-HP, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France [2] Universite Paris 6 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', '1] AP-HP, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France [2] Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Jeanne de Flandre, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Hopital des Enfants, Toulouse, France.', 'AP-HM, Hopital la Timone, Marseille, France.', ""Institut d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Pediatrique, Lyon, France."", 'Hopital Pellegrin Tripode, Bordeaux, France.', 'CHU Hopital Sud, Rennes, France.', 'Hopital de Hautepierre, Strasbourg, France.', 'Hopital Arnaud de Villeneuve, Montpellier, France.', 'Hopital Mere-Enfant, CHU-Nantes, Nantes, France.', '1] Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers, CRESS, INSERM U1153, Villejuif, France [2] Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.', '1] Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers, CRESS, INSERM U1153, Villejuif, France [2] Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France [3] RNHE-National Registry of Childhood Hematopoietic Malignancies, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150317,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Feeding/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Day Care Centers', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mothers', 'Pets', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC4366894,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc201553 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2015.53 [doi]']",epublish,Br J Cancer. 2015 Mar 17;112(6):1017-26. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2015.53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intestinal epithelial apoptosis is one of the most common histopathological changes of UC and the expression of a number of apoptosis genes may contribute to the progression of UC. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as powerful regulators of diverse cellular processes and have been shown to be involved in many immune-mediated disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and asthma. A unique microRNA expression profile has been identified in UC, suggesting that, microRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC. We investigated the role of miR-29a in intestinal epithelial apoptosis in UC. METHODS: The expression of miR-29a and Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, was evaluated in both UC patients and UC mice model induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The apoptosis rate of intestinal epithelial cells was also evaluated. RESULTS: In UC patients and DSS-induced UC in mice, the expression of miR-29a and Mcl-1, were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. We identified a miR-29a binding site (7 nucleotides) on the 3'UTR of mcl-1 and mutation in this binding site on the 3'UTR of mcl-1 led to mis-match between miR-29a and mcl-1. Knockout of Mcl-1 caused apoptosis of the colonic epithelial HT29 cells. In addition, miR-29a regulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of Mcl-1. CONCLUSION: miR-29a is involved in the pathogenesis of UC by regulating intestinal epithelial apoptosis via Mcl-1.","['Lv, Bo', 'Liu, Zhihui', 'Wang, Shuping', 'Liu, Fengbin', 'Yang, Xiaojun', 'Hou, Jiangtao', 'Hou, Zhengkun', 'Chen, Bin']","['Lv B', 'Liu Z', 'Wang S', 'Liu F', 'Yang X', 'Hou J', 'Hou Z', 'Chen B']","['Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.', 'First School of Clinic Medicine & First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141201,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",PMC4313986,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/10/29 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Dec 1;7(12):8542-52. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'MiR-29a', 'apoptosis', 'ulcerative colitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: All Chinese children and adolescent oncology patients aged 18 or below attending the Children's Centre for Cancer and Blood Disease at a hospital for chemotherapy were invited and parental consent was sought before they were accepted into the study. The study comprised of 1) a parental questionnaire, 2) the collection of medical history and 3) a clinical examination for tooth decay (caries) and mucosal status. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were invited, and they all participated in this study. Their mean age was 9.2+/-5.0 and 44 (64%) were males. Twenty-six patients (38%) had no caries experience (DMFT and/or dmft = 0). Higher caries experience was detected in participants that were not born in Hong Kong, had completed active chemotherapy, participated in school dental care service and whose parents had low educational levels. There were 41 patients with active chemotherapy, 24 of whom were diagnosed with acute leukaemia, 5 with haematological malignancies other than leukaemia and 11 with solid tumours. Antimetabolites, cytotoxic antibiotics, alkylating agents and plant alkaloids were administered in 49%, 32%, 24% and 22% of them, respectively. Twenty-six (63%) patients showed no mucosal complications. The most common oral complication was oral mucositis (24%) followed by petechiae (10%). CONCLUSION: About two-thirds of paediatric and adolescent cancer patients had caries experience, which was more common among those who had completed chemotherapy. Oral mucositis followed by petechiae were the two most common complications of receiving chemotherapy.","['Kung, A Y H', 'Zhang, S', 'Zheng, L W', 'Wong, G H M', 'Chu, C H']","['Kung AY', 'Zhang S', 'Zheng LW', 'Wong GH', 'Chu CH']","['Faculty of Dentistry, the University of Hong Kong, Republic of China.', 'Faculty of Dentistry, the University of Hong Kong, Republic of China.', 'Faculty of Dentistry, the University of Hong Kong, Republic of China.', 'Faculty of Dentistry, the University of Hong Kong, Republic of China.', 'Faculty of Dentistry, the University of Hong Kong, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150130,United Arab Emirates,Open Dent J,The open dentistry journal,101480503,,,,PMC4319200,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/02/13 06:01,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2174/1874210601509010021 [doi]', 'TODENTJ-9-21 [pii]']",epublish,Open Dent J. 2015 Jan 30;9:21-30. doi: 10.2174/1874210601509010021. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Caries', 'Chinese', 'adolescence', 'cancer.', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'mucositis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After induction therapy, he underwent a HLA-matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and six years later he relapsed as AML M1 with an abnormal karyotype //47,XX,+10[2]/47,XX,+11[3]/48,XX,+10,+11[2]/46,XX[13]. Based on this, we tested the possibility of donor cell origin by FISH and molecular STR analysis. We found no evidence of Y chromosome presence by FISH and STR analysis consistent with the success of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from the female donor. FISH studies confirmed trisomies and no evidence of MLL translocation either p53 or ATM deletion. Additionally 28 fusion common leukemia transcripts were evaluated by multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and were not rearranged. STR analysis showed a complete donor chimerism. Thus, donor cell leukemia (DCL) was concluded, being essential the use of cytological and molecular approaches. Pediatric DCL is uncommon, our patient seems to be the sixth case and additionally it presented a late donor cell leukemia appearance.

Methods : In the beta-elemene emulsion plus HAA chemotherapy (harringtonine, aclacinomycin, Ara-c group) group, 120 cases received beta-elemene emulsion (400 mg) plus the HAA treatment. A 14-day treatment was a course of treatment, followed by an 8-14 day pause, and then the next course of treatment. The HAA treatment included Ara-C, 100 mg/m2, once every 12 h from day 1 to day 7; aclacinomycin, 20 mg/m2, from day 1 to day 7; and homoharringtonine, 4 mg/m2, from day 1 to day 7. The patients in the control HAA group received HAA treatment only. For both groups, effective antibiotics were given to patients when it was necessary. Results : The total effective rate in the beta-elemene emulsion plus HAA group was 80.8%. But the total effective rate in the HAA only group was 52.9%. These results suggest that the beta-elemene emulsion plus HAA treatment has a much better curative effect in comparison with the HAA only treatment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, beta-elemene emulsion has slightly adverse response, without causing blood and bone marrow depression. Conclusion : beta-elemene emulsion has a curative effect in treatment of refractory/relapsed AML in combination with harringtonine, aclacinomycin, and Ara-c.","['Zheng, Cuiping', 'Cai, Xiaoping', 'Wu, Shenghao', 'Liu, Zhen', 'Shi, Yuejian', 'Zhou, Wenjin']","['Zheng C', 'Cai X', 'Wu S', 'Liu Z', 'Shi Y', 'Zhou W']","['Cuiping Zheng, Department of Blood Chemotherapy, The Central Hospital, Wenzhou, 325000, P.

Here we present a global analysis of trisomy 8 AML using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq). The study is based on three diagnostic trisomy 8 AML and their parallel relapse status in addition to nine non-trisomic AML and four normal bone marrows (NBMs). In contrast to non-trisomic DNA samples, trisomy 8 AML showed a characteristic DNA methylation distribution pattern because an increase in the frequency of the hypermethylation signals in chromosome 8 was associated with an increase in the hypomethylation signals in the rest of the chromosomes. Chromosome 8 hypermethylation signals were found mainly in the CpG island (CGI) shores and interspersed repeats. Validating the most significant differentially methylated CGI (P = 7.88 x 10(-11)) identified in trisomy 8 AML demonstrated a specific core region within the gene body of HHEX, which was significantly correlated with HHEX expression in both diagnostic and relapse trisomy 8 AMLs. Overall, the existence of extra chromosome 8 was associated with a global impact on the DNA methylation distribution with identification of HHEX gene methylation as a potential diagnostic marker for trisomy 8 AML.","['Saied, Marwa H', 'Marzec, Jacek', 'Khalid, Sabah', 'Smith, Paul', 'Molloy, Gael', 'Young, Bryan D']","['Saied MH', 'Marzec J', 'Khalid S', 'Smith P', 'Molloy G', 'Young BD']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom. ; Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom. ; Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150129,United States,Biomark Cancer,Biomarkers in cancer,101533144,,,,PMC4315123,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/02/13 06:01,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4137/BIC.S19614 [doi]', 'bic-7-2015-001 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Cancer. 2015 Jan 29;7:1-6. doi: 10.4137/BIC.S19614. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CGI shores', 'HHEX', 'MeDIP-seq', 'trisomy 8']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we characterize ALV-J strain PDRC-59831, a newly studied U.S. isolate of ALV-J. Five-day-old chicken embryos were infected with this virus, and the chickens developed myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas within 2 months after hatching. To investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations in the MET gene in two of the five hemangiomas studied. This integration locus was not seen in previous work characterizing ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis. MET is a known proto-oncogene that acts through a diverse set of signaling pathways and is involved in many neoplasms. We show that tumors harboring MET integrations exhibit strong overexpression of MET mRNA. IMPORTANCE: These data suggest that ALV-J induces oncogenesis by insertional mutagenesis, and integrations in the MET oncogene can drive the overexpression of MET and contribute to the development of hemangiomas.","['Justice, James 4th', 'Malhotra, Sanandan', 'Ruano, Miguel', 'Li, Yingying', 'Zavala, Guillermo', 'Lee, Nathan', 'Morgan, Robin', 'Beemon, Karen']","['Justice J 4th', 'Malhotra S', 'Ruano M', 'Li Y', 'Zavala G', 'Lee N', 'Morgan R', 'Beemon K']","['Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Animal and Food Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Population Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA KLB@jhu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150211,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Chickens', 'Hemangioma/*virology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*genetics', 'United States', '*Virus Integration']",PMC4403454,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03225-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03225-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 May;89(9):4712-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03225-14.

VP8 is phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase 2 (CK2) and BoHV-1 unique short protein 3 (US3). In this study, VP8 was found to be phosphorylated in both transfected and infected cells but was detected as a nonphosphorylated form in mature virions. This suggests that phosphorylation of VP8 is strictly controlled during different stages of the viral life cycle. The regulation and function of VP8 phosphorylation by US3 and CK2 were further analyzed. An in vitro kinase assay, site-directed mutagenesis, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to identify the active sites for US3 and CK2. The two kinases phosphorylate VP8 at different sites, resulting in distinct phosphopeptide patterns. S(16) is a primary phosphoreceptor for US3, and it subsequently triggers phosphorylation at S(32). CK2 has multiple active sites, among which T(107) appears to be the preferred residue. Additionally, CK2 consensus motifs in the N terminus of VP8 are essential for phosphorylation. Based on these results, a nonphosphorylated VP8 mutant was constructed and used for further studies. In transfected cells phosphorylation was not required for nuclear localization of VP8. Phosphorylated VP8 appeared to recruit promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and to remodel the distribution of PML in the nucleus; however, PML protein did not show an association with nonphosphorylated VP8. This suggests that VP8 plays a role in resisting PML-related host antiviral defenses by redistributing PML protein and that this function depends on the phosphorylation of VP8. IMPORTANCE: The progression of VP8 phosphorylation over time and its function in BoHV-1 replication have not been characterized. This study demonstrates that activation of S(16) initiates further phosphorylation at S(32) by US3. Additionally, VP8 is phosphorylated by CK2 at several residues, with T(107) having the highest level of phosphorylation. Evidence for a difference in the phosphorylation status of VP8 in host cells and mature virus is presented for the first time. Phosphorylation was found to be a critical modification, which enables VP8 to attract and to redistribute PML protein in the nucleus. This might promote viral replication through interference with a PML-mediated antiviral defense. This study provides new insights into the regulation of VP8 phosphorylation and suggests a novel, phosphorylation-dependent function for VP8 in the life cycle of BoHV-1, which is important in view of the fact that VP8 is essential for virus replication in vivo.","['Zhang, Kuan', 'Afroz, Sharmin', 'Brownlie, Robert', 'Snider, Marlene', 'van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, Sylvia']","['Zhang K', 'Afroz S', 'Brownlie R', 'Snider M', 'van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk S']","['VIDO-InterVac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada Vaccinology and Immunotherapeutics, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', 'VIDO-InterVac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada Vaccinology and Immunotherapeutics, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', 'VIDO-InterVac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', 'VIDO-InterVac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', 'VIDO-InterVac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada sylvia.vandenhurk@usask.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150211,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (VP8 protein, Bovine herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Casein Kinase II/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Cattle/*virology', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism']",PMC4442349,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03180-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03180-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Apr;89(8):4598-611. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03180-14.

We previously found that Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) plays a critical role in CLL B-cell survival. Here, we explored the possibility of using a high-affinity Axl inhibitor as a single agent or in combination with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors for future clinical trial to treat patients with CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression/activation status of other members of the TAM (e.g., Tyro3, Axl, and MER) family of RTKs in CLL B cells was evaluated. Cells were treated with a high-affinity orally bioavailable Axl inhibitor TP-0903 with or without the presence of CLL bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Inhibitory effects of TP-0903 on the Axl signaling pathway were also evaluated in CLL B cells. Finally, cells were exposed to TP-0903 in combination with BTK inhibitors to determine any synergistic/additive effects of the combination. RESULTS: CLL B cells overexpress Tyro3, but not MER. Of interest, Tyro3 remains as constitutively phosphorylated and forms a complex with Axl in CLL B cells. TP-0903 induces massive apoptosis in CLL B cells with LD50 values of nanomolar ranges. Importantly, CLL BMSCs could not protect the leukemic B cells from TP-0903-induced apoptosis. A marked reduction of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and XIAP and upregulation of the proapoptotic protein BIM in CLL B cells was detected as a result of Axl inhibition. Finally, combination of TP-0903 with BTK inhibitors augments CLL B-cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of TP-0903 either as a single agent or in combination with BTK inhibitors may be effective in treating patients with CLL.","['Sinha, Sutapa', 'Boysen, Justin', 'Nelson, Michael', 'Secreto, Charla', 'Warner, Steven L', 'Bearss, David J', 'Lesnick, Connie', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Ghosh, Asish K']","['Sinha S', 'Boysen J', 'Nelson M', 'Secreto C', 'Warner SL', 'Bearss DJ', 'Lesnick C', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Ghosh AK']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lehi, Utah.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lehi, Utah.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. ghosh.asish@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150211,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '14D65TV20J (dubermatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",PMC4479154,2015/02/13 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-1892 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1892 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 May 1;21(9):2115-26. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1892.

T-cell LGL leukemia is typically a disorder of mature CD3, CD8 and T-cell receptor TCR (TCR - T cell receptor)-alphabeta positive cytotoxic T-cells. Rare variants include TCRgammadelta+ variants and CD4 + TCRalphabeta+ cases. We report a case of each of these rare variants. An 83-year-old female presented with anemia and lymphocytosis with LGLs on peripheral smear. Six-color multiparametric flowcytometric analysis showed expression of CD3, heterogeneous CD7, dim CD2 and TCRgammadelta and lacked expression of CD5, TCRalphabeta, CD56, CD4 and CD8. A final diagnosis of TCRgammadelta+ T-cell LGL leukemia was made. Differentiation between TCRgammadelta+ T-cell LGL leukemia and other gammadelta+ T-cell malignancies is of utmost importance due to the indolent nature of the former as compared to the highly aggressive behavior of the latter. An 85-year-old male diagnosed with liposarcoma was identified to have lymphocytosis during preoperative evaluation. Peripheral smear showed presence of LGLs. Flowcytometric immunophenotyping showed expression of TCRalphabeta, CD3, CD2, CD5, CD4, dim CD8, CD56 with aberrant loss of CD7 expression. Vbeta repertoire analysis by flowcytometry showed 97% cells with Vbeta14 clonality. A final diagnosis of TCRalphabeta+ CD4 + T-cell LGL leukemia was made. CD4 + T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemias have an indolent, less aggressive course when compared to their CD8 + counterparts and are not necessarily associated with cytopenias. However, their association with secondary neoplasia (29% of the cases) warrants a high degree of suspicion in the diagnosis as also noted in the index case. Use of a wide panel of antibodies and newer modalities such as Vbeta repertoire analysis helps in accurate subtyping of LGL leukemia.","['Rabade, Nikhil', 'Mansukhani, Dia', 'Khodaiji, Shanaz', 'Padte, Balkrishna', 'Bhave, Abhay', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Subramanian, Papagudi Ganesan', 'Sehgal, Kunal']","['Rabade N', 'Mansukhani D', 'Khodaiji S', 'Padte B', 'Bhave A', 'Tembhare P', 'Subramanian PG', 'Sehgal K']","['Hematology Laboratory, P.

Accurate diagnosis of HCL is important as treatment with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cladribine) is associated with >80% chance of complete cure. The recent description of BRAF p.V600E mutations in almost all HCL cases in various studies has not only improved the pathogenetic understanding of this entity but also increased the diagnostic accuracy of this disorder. AIM: The aim of the study was to standardize a molecular test for diagnosis of HCL and compare with standard established morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotypic parameters for HCL diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence of this mutation was sought in 20 patients with either classical HCL or HCL variant (HCLv) by Sanger sequencing and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. BRAF p.V600E mutation was present in all HCL cases and absent in the only HCLv case. RESULTS: A high degree of correlation was noted between the presence of BRAF p.V600E and established diagnostic criteria in 20/20 patients with HCL/HCLv. Our data supports the observation that this mutation is present in all cases of HCL and is absent in HCLv. Hence, detection of the BRAF p.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of 256 children treated for ALL under the CCLG-2008 protocol in Beijing Children's Hospital. RESULTS: There were 65 infectious complications in 50 patients during vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase and dexamethasone induction therapy, including microbiologically documented infections (n = 12; 18.5%), clinically documented infections (n = 23; 35.3%) and fever of unknown origin (n = 30; 46.2%). Neutropenia was present in 83.1% of the infectious episodes. In all, most infections occurred around the 15 th day of induction treatment (n = 28), and no patients died of infection-associated complications. CONCLUSIONS: The infections in this study was independent of treatment response, minimal residual diseases at the end of induction therapy, gender, immunophenotype, infection at first visit, risk stratification at diagnosis, unfavorable karyotypes at diagnosis and morphologic type. The infection rate of CCLG-2008 induction therapy is low, and the outcome of patients is favorable.","['Li, Si-Dan', 'Chen, Yong-Bing', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Wu, Run-Hui', 'Qin, Mao-Quan', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Jiang, Jin', 'Zhang, Rui-Dong', 'Xie, Jing', 'Ma, Xiao-Li', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Wang, Bin', 'Wu, Ying', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong', 'Wu, Min-Yuan']","['Li SD', 'Chen YB', 'Li ZG', 'Wu RH', 'Qin MQ', 'Zhou X', 'Jiang J', 'Zhang RD', 'Xie J', 'Ma XL', 'Zhang R', 'Wang B', 'Wu Y', 'Zheng HY', 'Wu MY']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education; Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",PMC4836249,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2015_128_4_472_151085 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.151085 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2015 Feb 20;128(4):472-6. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.151085.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eight cancer and four non-cancer outcomes were examined using conditional logistic regression. Incidence density sampling was used to match each case to 200 controls on attained age. Days accrued in firefighting assignments (exposed-days), run totals (fire-runs) and run times (fire-hours) were used as exposure surrogates. HRs comparing 75th and 25th centiles of lagged cumulative exposures were calculated using loglinear, linear, log-quadratic, power and restricted cubic spline general relative risk models. Piecewise constant models were used to examine risk differences by time since exposure, age at exposure and calendar period. RESULTS: Among 19,309 male firefighters eligible for the study, there were 1333 cancer deaths and 2609 cancer incidence cases. Significant positive associations between fire-hours and lung cancer mortality and incidence were evident. A similar relation between leukaemia mortality and fire-runs was also found. The lung cancer associations were nearly linear in cumulative exposure, while the association with leukaemia mortality was attenuated at higher exposure levels and greater for recent exposures. Significant negative associations were evident for the exposure surrogates and colorectal and prostate cancers, suggesting a healthy worker survivor effect possibly enhanced by medical screening. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer and leukaemia mortality risks were modestly increasing with firefighter exposures. These findings add to evidence of a causal association between firefighting and cancer. Nevertheless, small effects merit cautious interpretation. We plan to continue to follow the occurrence of disease and injury in this cohort.","['Daniels, Robert D', 'Bertke, Stephen', 'Dahm, Matthew M', 'Yiin, James H', 'Kubale, Travis L', 'Hales, Thomas R', 'Baris, Dalsu', 'Zahm, Shelia H', 'Beaumont, James J', 'Waters, Kathleen M', 'Pinkerton, Lynne E']","['Daniels RD', 'Bertke S', 'Dahm MM', 'Yiin JH', 'Kubale TL', 'Hales TR', 'Baris D', 'Zahm SH', 'Beaumont JJ', 'Waters KM', 'Pinkerton LE']","['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.', 'UC Davis Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20150211,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', '*Cause of Death', 'Chicago', 'Cohort Studies', 'Firefighters/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Philadelphia', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'San Francisco', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC4558385,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2014-102671 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2014-102671 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2015 Oct;72(10):699-706. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2014-102671.

In ACD, DCs can interact with PMNs that are recruited and activated, leading, in particular, to ectosome release. The objective of this work was to characterize the effects of PMN-Ect on DC functions in an ACD context. We first developed a standardized protocol to produce, characterize, and quantify ectosomes by use of human PLB-985 cells, differentiated into mature PMN (PLB-Ect). We then studied the in vitro effects of these purified ectosomes on human moDC functions in response to NiSO4 and to LPS, another TLR4 agonist. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that PLB-Ect was internalized by moDCs and localized in the lysosomal compartment. We then showed that PLB-Ect down-regulated NiSO4-induced moDC maturation, as witnessed by decreased expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, PDL-1, and HLA-DR and by decreased levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-12p40 mRNAs. These effects were related to p38MAPK and NF-kappaB down-regulation. However, no increase in pan-regulatory DC marker genes (GILZ, CATC, C1QA) was observed; rather, levels of effector DC markers (Mx1, NMES1) were increased. Finally, when these PLB-Ect + NiSO4-treated moDCs were cocultured with CD4(+) T cells, a Th2 cytokine profile seemed to be induced, as shown, in particular, by enhanced IL-13 production. Together, these results suggest that the PMN-Ect can modulate DC maturation in response to nickel, a common chemical sensitizer responsible for ADC.","['Turbica, Isabelle', 'Gallais, Yann', 'Gueguen, Claire', 'Tharinger, Hugo', 'Al Sabbagh, Chantal', 'Gorges, Roseline', 'Gary-Gouy, Helene', 'Kerdine-Romer, Saadia', 'Pallardy, Marc', 'Mascarell, Laurent', 'Gleizes, Aude', 'Chollet-Martin, Sylvie']","['Turbica I', 'Gallais Y', 'Gueguen C', 'Tharinger H', 'Al Sabbagh C', 'Gorges R', 'Gary-Gouy H', 'Kerdine-Romer S', 'Pallardy M', 'Mascarell L', 'Gleizes A', 'Chollet-Martin S']","['*INSERM, UMR 996, Faculte de Pharmacie, Univ.

Hereby, cytogenetic aberrations and small-scale abnormalities, such as single-nucleotide variations and insertion/deletion mutations, have emerged as two alternative modes of genetic diversification. Both mechanisms are at work in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in which conventional karyotyping and molecular studies demonstrate that gene mutations occur predominantly in cytogenetically normal AML, whereas chromosomal changes are a driving force of development and progression of disease in aberrant karyotype AML. All steps of disease evolution in AML, ranging from the transformation of preleukemic clones into overt leukemia to the expansion and recurrence of malignant clones, are paralleled by clonal evolution at either the gene mutation or chromosome aberration level. Preleukemic conditions, such as Fanconi anemia and Bloom syndrome, demonstrate that the acquisition of chromosomal aberrations can contribute to leukemic transformation. Similar to what has been shown at the mutational level, expansion and recurrence of AML clones goes along with increasing genetic diversification. Hereby, cytogenetically more evolved subclones are at a proliferative advantage and outgrow ancestor clones or have evolved toward a more aggressive behavior with additional newly acquired aberrations as compared with the initial leukemic clone, respectively.","['Bochtler, T', 'Frohling, S', 'Kramer, A']","['Bochtler T', 'Frohling S', 'Kramer A']","['1] Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany [2] Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany [2] Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Clone Cells', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201532 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.32 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1243-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.32.

Signal-induced proliferation-associated protein 1 (SIPA-1) is a Rap1GTPase activating protein (Rap1GAP) expressed in the normal distal and collecting tubules of the murine kidney. Lupus-like autoimmune disease and leukemia have been observed in SIPA-1 deficient mice, suggesting a pathological relevance of SIPA-1 to SLE and carcinoma in human being. The expression pattern of SIPA-1 is as yet undefined and the pathogenesis of these diseases in humans remains elusive. In this study, we used both immunohistochemistry and quantum dot (QD)-based immunofluorescence staining to investigate the expression of SIPA-1 in renal specimens from SLE and CC-RCC patients. MTT assay and Western blotting were employed to evaluate the effects of SIPA-1 overexpression on the proliferation and apoptosis of renal cell lines. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was applied to examine the changes of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) mRNA level. Results showed that SIPA-1 was highly expressed in the proximal and collecting tubules of nephrons in SLE patients compared to normal ones, and similar results were obtained in the specimens of CC-RCC patients. Although SIPA-1 overexpression did not affect cellular proliferation and apoptosis of both human 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells and rat NRK-52E renal epithelial cell lines, RT-PCR results showed that HIF-1alpha mRNA level was down-regulated by SIPA-1 overexpression in 786-O cells. These findings suggest that SIPA-1 may play critical roles in the pathological changes in kidney, and might provide a new biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of SLE and CC-RCC.","['Feng, Ai-Ping', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Li, Min', 'Jiang, Xin-Nong', 'Zhang, Zong-Yong', 'Zhu, Peng', 'Wang, Ming-Wei', 'Wei, Shao-Zhong', 'Su, Li']","['Feng AP', 'Zhang Q', 'Li M', 'Jiang XN', 'Zhang ZY', 'Zhu P', 'Wang MW', 'Wei SZ', 'Su L']","['Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. feng-aiping@medmail.com.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Wuhan, 430079, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Wuhan, 430079, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China. lisu@mail.hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150212,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate synthetically the effect of CYP3A5 FNx01 3 polymorphism on the risk of ALL in children. METHODS: Case-control studies investigating the relationship between CYP3A5 FNx01 3 genetic polymorphism and ALL risk in children were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association between CYP3A5 FNx01 3 polymorphism and ALL risk in children. Q-statistic test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed through funnel plot. RESULTS: In total, five case-control studies with 1070 cases and 1125 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the results of heterogeneity, fixed-effects or random-effects models were applied to estimate the pooled ORs. The pooled ORs (95% CIs) for CYP3A5 FNx01 3 heterozygous mutant, homozygous mutant, and (heterozygous + homozygous) mutant were 1.47 (0.97-2.21), 1.05 (0.62-1.79), and 1.67 (1.14-2.44) with P = 0.07, 0.86, and 0.009, respectively. In subgroup analysis, the Z values of CYP3A5 FNx01 3 (heterozygous + homozygous) mutant and children with ALL in Asian and Caucasian populations were 1.34 and 2.51 with P = 0.18 and 0.01, respectively. No significant publication bias was detected by funnel plot. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis showed that there was association between CYP3A5 FNx01 3 polymorphism and the altered risk of ALL in children, especially in Caucasian populations.","['Ma, Li-Min', 'Liu, Hong-Chao', 'Ruan, Lin-Hai', 'Feng, Yan-Ming']","['Ma LM', 'Liu HC', 'Ruan LH', 'Feng YM']","['Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Henan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,Biomed J,Biomedical journal,101599820,['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)'],IM,"['Asians', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Whites/genetics']",,2015/02/13 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['151029 [pii]', '10.4103/2319-4170.151029 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed J. 2015 Sep-Oct;38(5):428-32. doi: 10.4103/2319-4170.151029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The tumorigenic potential of My1/De blast cells was followed by cytology and by the kinetics of (18)FDG uptake. The toxicity of MTX on chromatin condensation was compared to predictive normal intermediates of chromosome condensation in control cells. RESULTS: MTX below 0.1 microg/ml did not cause visible changes in interphase chromatin structure. At its lowest toxic concentration (0.1 microg/ml) chromatin margination was confined to the outer edge of the nucleus. Between 0.1 and 5 microg/ml concentrations apoptotic chromatin shrinkage correlated with the dose of MTX. Apoptosis was exerted in early S phase excluding the mitotic effect. At higher MTX concentrations (>10 microg/ml) necrotic disruption and expansion took place. The lowest necrotic concentration (10 microg/ml) was close to highest apoptotic MTX concentration (5 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The switch from apoptosis to inflammatory necrosis taking place within a narrow concentration range supports the notion of a narrow therapeutic spectrum.

Here, we report our experience with 4 patients with relapsed AML after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), who were treated with the immunocytokine F16-IL2, in combination with low-dose cytarabine. One patient with disseminated extramedullary AML lesions achieved a complete metabolic response identified by PET/CT, which lasted 3 months. Two of 3 patients with bone marrow relapse achieved a blast reduction with transient molecular negativity. One of the 2 patients enjoyed a short complete remission before AML relapse occurred 2 months after the first infusion of F16-IL2. In line with a site-directed delivery of the cytokine, F16-IL2 led to an extensive infiltration of immune effector cells in the bone marrow. Grade 2 fevers were the only nonhematologic side effects in 2 patients. Grade 3 cytokine-release syndrome developed in the other 2 patients but was manageable in both cases with glucocorticoids. The concept of specifically targeting IL2 to the leukemia-associated stroma deserves further evaluation in clinical trials, especially in patients who relapse after allo-HSCT.","['Schliemann, Christoph', 'Gutbrodt, Katrin L', 'Kerkhoff, Andrea', 'Pohlen, Michele', 'Wiebe, Stefanie', 'Silling, Gerda', 'Angenendt, Linus', 'Kessler, Torsten', 'Mesters, Rolf M', 'Giovannoni, Leonardo', 'Schafers, Michael', 'Altvater, Bianca', 'Rossig, Claudia', 'Grunewald, Inga', 'Wardelmann, Eva', 'Kohler, Gabriele', 'Neri, Dario', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E']","['Schliemann C', 'Gutbrodt KL', 'Kerkhoff A', 'Pohlen M', 'Wiebe S', 'Silling G', 'Angenendt L', 'Kessler T', 'Mesters RM', 'Giovannoni L', 'Schafers M', 'Altvater B', 'Rossig C', 'Grunewald I', 'Wardelmann E', 'Kohler G', 'Neri D', 'Stelljes M', 'Berdel WE']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Philogen SpA, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", 'Gerhard-Domagk-Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Gerhard-Domagk-Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Gerhard-Domagk-Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.

The aims of current study were to evaluate whether Mcl-1 affects the survival or death of gastric cancer cells, and to investigate the prognostic value of its expression in gastric cancer. PcDNA3.1-Mcl-1 expression and Mcl-1 siRNA vectors were used to overexpress and silence Mcl-1 expression in gastric cancer cell lines including SNU638 and TMK1, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of Mcl-1 in gastric cancer tissues. Apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay, and cell proliferation was determined by immunostaining with a Ki-67 antibody. Mcl-1 knockdown induced apoptosis through the upregulation of caspase-3, and -7, and PARP activity, and the release of Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 into the cytoplasm. Additionally, cell cycle arrest occurred due to decrease of cyclin D1, cell division cycle gene 2 (cdc2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6. In contrast, overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Mcl-1 knockdown did not suppress tumor cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells, whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 enhanced tumor cell proliferation. The JAK2 and STAT3 signaling cascades were significantly blocked by Mcl-1 knockdown. The mean Ki-67 labeling index (KI) value of Mcl-1 positive tumors was significantly lower than that of Mcl-1 negative tumors. However, there was no significant difference between Mcl-1 expression and the apoptotic index (AI). Mcl-1 expression was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa tissues, and was associated with age, tumor size, stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and poor survival. Our study showed that Mcl-1 regulates the cell growth and might be a potential prognostic marker for gastric cancer.","['Lee, Wan-Sik', 'Park, Young-Lan', 'Kim, Nuri', 'Oh, Hyung-Hoon', 'Son, Dong-Jun', 'Kim, Mi-Young', 'Oak, Chan-Young', 'Chung, Cho-Yun', 'Park, Hyung-Chul', 'Kim, Jong-Sun', 'Myung, Dae-Seong', 'Cho, Sung-Bum', 'Joo, Young-Eun']","['Lee WS', 'Park YL', 'Kim N', 'Oh HH', 'Son DJ', 'Kim MY', 'Oak CY', 'Chung CY', 'Park HC', 'Kim JS', 'Myung DS', 'Cho SB', 'Joo YE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-ku, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150210,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Transfection']",,2015/02/13 06:00,2015/12/30 06:00,['2015/02/13 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.2890 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 May;46(5):2154-62. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.2890.

When grown on MEF feeders, rESC lines derived from fertilized embryos were established and maintained in medium containing paracrine factors LIF (via STAT3) and/or FGF2 (via MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT). However, high levels of ERK1/2 and AKT activities in rESCs were crucial for maintaining their undifferentiated proliferation. Although rESCs under the influence of either LIF (500, 1,000, and 2,000 U/ml) or FGF2 (5, 10, and 20 ng/ml) alone had enhanced expression of pluripotency markers, peak expression occurred when both LIF (1,000 U/ml) and FGF2 (10 ng/ml) were applied. Induced dephosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and AKT by specific inhibitors limited growth of rESCs and caused remarkable losses of self-renewal capacity; therefore, we inferred that STAT3, ERK, and AKT had essential roles in maintaining rESC proliferation and self-renewal. We concluded that LIF and FGF2 jointly maintained the undifferentiated state and self-renewal of rESCs through an integrative signaling module.","['Lo, Neng-Wen', 'Intawicha, Payungsuk', 'Chiu, Yung-Tsung', 'Lee, Kun-Hsiung', 'Lu, Hsi-Chi', 'Chen, Chien-Hong', 'Chang, Yong-Hsuan', 'Chen, Chun-Da', 'Ju, Jyh-Cherng']","['Lo NW', 'Intawicha P', 'Chiu YT', 'Lee KH', 'Lu HC', 'Chen CH', 'Chang YH', 'Chen CD', 'Ju JC']","['Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150210,United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Zygote/cytology']",,2015/02/12 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/02/12 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['content-CT-2534_Lo_et_al [pii]', '10.3727/096368915X686832 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2015;24(3):319-38. doi: 10.3727/096368915X686832.

A splice variant of FIR that lacks exon 2 in the transcriptional repressor domain (FIRDeltaexon2) upregulates c-myc transcription by inactivating wild-type FIR. The ratio of FIRDeltaexon2/FIR mRNA was increased in human colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Because FIRDeltaexon2 is considered to be a dominant negative regulator of FIR, FIR heterozygous knockout (FIR(+)/(-)) C57BL6 mice were generated. FIR complete knockout (FIR(-)/(-)) was embryonic lethal before E9.5; therefore, it is essential for embryogenesis. This strongly suggests that insufficiency of FIR is crucial for carcinogenesis. FIR(+)/(-) mice exhibited prominent c-myc mRNA upregulation, particularly in the peripheral blood (PB), without any significant pathogenic phenotype. Furthermore, elevated FIRDeltaexon2/FIR mRNA expression was detected in human leukemia samples and cell lines. Because the single knockout of TP53 generates thymic lymphoma, FIR(+)/(-)TP53(-)/(-) generated T-cell type acute lymphocytic/lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with increased organ or bone marrow invasion with poor prognosis. RNA-sequencing analysis of sorted thymic lymphoma cells revealed that the Notch signaling pathway was activated significantly in FIR(+)/(-)TP53(-)/(-) compared with that in FIR(+)/(+)TP53(-)/(-) mice. Notch1 mRNA expression in sorted thymic lymphoma cells was confirmed using qRT-PCR. In addition, flow cytometry revealed that c-myc mRNA was negatively correlated with FIR but positively correlated with Notch1 in sorted T-ALL/thymic lymphoma cells. Moreover, the knockdown of TP53 or c-myc using siRNA decreased Notch1 expression in cancer cells. In addition, an adenovirus vector encoding FIRDeltaexon2 cDNA increased bleomycin-induced DNA damage. Taken together, these data suggest that the altered expression of FIRDeltaexon2 increased Notch1 at least partially by activating c-Myc via a TP53-independent pathway.

Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of ST7612AA1 in solid and haematological tumors, and to characterize its mechanism of action. In vitro, ST7612AA1 potently inhibited different class I and class II HDACs, leading to restore the balance of both histone and non-histone protein acetylation. In vivo, it induced significant anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of lung, colon, breast and ovarian carcinomas, leukemia and lymphoma. This was likely due to the modulation of different HDAC substrates and induction of transcriptional changes with respect to several genes involved in key processes, such as cell cycle regulation, DNA damage checkpoints, immune response, cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. PK analysis confirmed the pro-drug nature of ST7612AA1, which is rapidly absorbed and converted to ST7464AA1 after a single oral dose in mice. ST7612AA1 was selected from a novel generation of oral HDAC inhibitors. Its high efficacy correlated with its potent and selective inhibitory activity of HDAC and was combined with a favorable pharmacodynamics profile. These aspects support a clinical development of ST7612AA1 towards a broad spectrum of human solid and haematologic malignancies.","['Vesci, Loredana', 'Bernasconi, Elena', 'Milazzo, Ferdinando Maria', 'De Santis, Rita', 'Gaudio, Eugenio', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Pace, Silvia', 'Carollo, Valeria', 'Giannini, Giuseppe', 'Bertoni, Francesco']","['Vesci L', 'Bernasconi E', 'Milazzo FM', 'De Santis R', 'Gaudio E', 'Kwee I', 'Rinaldi A', 'Pace S', 'Carollo V', 'Giannini G', 'Bertoni F']","['Research & Development, Sigma-Tau, Pomezia, Italy.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Research & Development, Sigma-Tau, Pomezia, Italy.', 'Research & Development, Sigma-Tau, Pomezia, Italy.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA), Manno, Switzerland.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Research & Development, Sigma-Tau, Pomezia, Italy.', 'Hysto-Cyto Service srl, Rome, Italy.', 'Research & Development, Sigma-Tau, Pomezia, Italy.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Lymphoma Unit, IOSI Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Anilides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (thioacetic acid', 'S-(6-((5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carbonyl)amino)-6-phenylcarbamoylhexyl) ester)']",IM,"['Anilides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pyrrolidinones/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4467398,2015/02/12 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/02/12 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['3240 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3240 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 20;6(8):5735-48. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3240.,,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-tumor', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'oral', 'preclinical', 'tumor models']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the effect of the order in which mutations are acquired. METHODS: We determined mutation order in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms by genotyping hematopoietic colonies or by means of next-generation sequencing. Stem cells and progenitor cells were isolated to study the effect of mutation order on mature and immature hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: The age at which a patient presented with a myeloproliferative neoplasm, acquisition of JAK2 V617F homozygosity, and the balance of immature progenitors were all influenced by mutation order. As compared with patients in whom the TET2 mutation was acquired first (hereafter referred to as ""TET2-first patients""), patients in whom the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation was acquired first (""JAK2-first patients"") had a greater likelihood of presenting with polycythemia vera than with essential thrombocythemia, an increased risk of thrombosis, and an increased sensitivity of JAK2-mutant progenitors to ruxolitinib in vitro. Mutation order influenced the proliferative response to JAK2 V617F and the capacity of double-mutant hematopoietic cells and progenitor cells to generate colony-forming cells. Moreover, the hematopoietic stem-and-progenitor-cell compartment was dominated by TET2 single-mutant cells in TET2-first patients but by JAK2-TET2 double-mutant cells in JAK2-first patients. Prior mutation of TET2 altered the transcriptional consequences of JAK2 V617F in a cell-intrinsic manner and prevented JAK2 V617F from up-regulating genes associated with proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The order in which JAK2 and TET2 mutations were acquired influenced clinical features, the response to targeted therapy, the biology of stem and progenitor cells, and clonal evolution in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Yet, the mechanisms by which nanoparticles interact with biological structures as well as their biological impact and hazards remain poorly investigated. Due to their large surface to volume ratio, nanoparticles usually exhibit properties that differ from those of bulk materials. Particularly, the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles is crucial for their durability and solubility in biological media as well as for their biocompatibility and biodistribution. Polystyrene does not degrade in the cellular environment and exhibits no short-term cytotoxicity. Because polystyrene nanoparticles can be easily synthesized in a wide range of sizes with distinct surface functionalizations, they are perfectly suited as model particles to study the effects of the particle surface characteristics on various biological parameters. Therefore, we have exploited polystyrene nanoparticles as a convenient platform to study bio-nano interactions. This review summarizes studies on positively and negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles and compares them with clinically used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.","['Loos, Cornelia', 'Syrovets, Tatiana', 'Musyanovych, Anna', 'Mailander, Volker', 'Landfester, Katharina', 'Nienhaus, G Ulrich', 'Simmet, Thomas']","['Loos C', 'Syrovets T', 'Musyanovych A', 'Mailander V', 'Landfester K', 'Nienhaus GU', 'Simmet T']","['Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products & Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, Helmholtzstr. 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products & Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, Helmholtzstr. 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Ackermannweg 10, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Ackermannweg 10, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Ackermannweg 10, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Applied Physics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Wolfgang Gaede-Str. 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany, ; Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1110 West Green Str.

Previously, we could show that miR-138 and -424 are downregulated in CLL cells. Here, we identified 2 new target genes, namely acyl protein thioesterase (APT) 1 and 2, which are under control of both miRs and thereby significantly overexpressed in CLL cells. APTs are the only enzymes known to promote depalmitoylation. Indeed, membrane proteins are significantly less palmitoylated in CLL cells compared with normal B cells. We identified APTs to directly interact with CD95 to promote depalmitoylation, thus impairing apoptosis mediated through CD95. Specific inhibition of APTs by siRNAs, treatment with miRs-138/-424, and pharmacologic approaches restore CD95-mediated apoptosis in CLL cells and other cancer cells, pointing to an important regulatory role of APTs in CD95 apoptosis. The identification of the depalmitoylation reaction of CD95 by APTs as a microRNA (miRNA) target provides a novel molecular mechanism for how malignant cells escape from CD95-mediated apoptosis. Here, we introduce palmitoylation as a novel posttranslational modification in CLL, which might impact on localization, mobility, and function of molecules, survival signaling, and migration.","['Berg, Valeska', 'Rusch, Marion', 'Vartak, Nachiket', 'Jungst, Christian', 'Schauss, Astrid', 'Waldmann, Herbert', 'Hedberg, Christian', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Bastiaens, Philippe I H', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Frenzel, Lukas P']","['Berg V', 'Rusch M', 'Vartak N', 'Jungst C', 'Schauss A', 'Waldmann H', 'Hedberg C', 'Pallasch CP', 'Bastiaens PI', 'Hallek M', 'Wendtner CM', 'Frenzel LP']","['Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Chemical Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany;', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany;', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany;', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Chemical Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany;', 'Department of Chemical Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany;', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany; Department of Systemic Cell Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany; and.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany;', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, Klinikum Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MIRN138 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN424 microrna, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (LYPLA1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (LYPLA2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipoylation', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4654424,2015/02/12 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/02/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31716-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-07-586511 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 7;125(19):2948-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-07-586511.

However, its requirement in normal hematopoiesis and megakaryocyte development has not been extensively characterized. Based on its role as a cell cycle regulator, we predicted that an Aurka deficiency would lead to severe abnormalities in all hematopoietic lineages. Here we reveal that loss of Aurka in hematopoietic cells causes profound cell autonomous defects in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Surprisingly, in contrast to the survival defects of nearly all hematopoietic lineages, deletion of Aurka was associated with increased differentiation and polyploidization of megakaryocytes both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, in contrast to other cell types examined, megakaryocytes continued DNA synthesis after loss of Aurka. Thus, like other cell cycle regulators such as Aurkb and survivin, Aurka is required for hematopoiesis, but is dispensable for megakaryocyte endomitosis. Our work supports a growing body of evidence that the megakaryocyte endomitotic cell cycle differs significantly from the proliferative cell cycle.","['Goldenson, Benjamin', 'Kirsammer, Gina', 'Stankiewicz, Monika J', 'Wen, Qiang Jeremy', 'Crispino, John D']","['Goldenson B', 'Kirsammer G', 'Stankiewicz MJ', 'Wen QJ', 'Crispino JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurka protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/physiology', 'Animals', 'Aurora Kinase A/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitosis/*genetics', 'Polyploidy', 'Thrombopoiesis/genetics']",PMC4375110,2015/02/12 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/02/12 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31870-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-615401 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Mar 26;125(13):2141-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-615401.

Furthermore, it was approved in the European Union as first-line therapy for poor-prognosis CLL with 17p deletions or TP53 mutations and in patients unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy. Idelalisib is an orally bioavailable ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor that targets the PI3K p110 isoform delta (PI3Kdelta) with high potency and selectivity. PI3Kdelta is hyperactivated in B-cell malignancies and plays a pivotal role in the B-cell receptor pathway, a key oncogenic driver in B-cell malignancies. The near exclusive expression of the PI3Kdelta isoform in hematopoietic cells and the selectivity of idelalisib for the PI3Kdelta isoform are essential for its efficacy and tolerability, even in elderly patients unfit for chemotherapy. Idelalisib is the first PI3K inhibitor approved by the regulatory agencies; this approval will change the treatment landscape of indolent B-cell malignancies.","['Yang, Qingshan', 'Modi, Prexy', 'Newcomb, Terry', 'Queva, Christophe', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Yang Q', 'Modi P', 'Newcomb T', 'Queva C', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Gilead Sciences, Seattle, Washington.', 'Gilead Sciences, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib is hampered by the emergence of acquired resistance, for which multifactorial mechanisms have been identified. This review summarizes the current status of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to proteasome inhibitors that emerged in preclinical therapeutic studies, and discusses these findings in the clinical perspective of novel therapeutic modalities of hematological malignancies. The specific topics that will be addressed in the current review include the recently established mechanisms of resistance to proteasome inhibitors: the role of constitutive and immunoproteasomes, mutations in proteasome subunits, unfolded protein response, XBP1 and MARCKS proteins, multidrug efflux transporters, aggresomes and autophagy, as well as the impact of pro-survival signaling pathways and bone marrow microenvironment. The growing knowledge of the determinants that confer bortezomib resistance and/or toxicity has provided the basis for the rational development of second generation proteasome inhibitors, some of which were recently approved or that are undergoing clinical evaluation as novel strategies to overcome bortezomib resistance as well as to enhance clinical therapeutic efficacy along with minimal side effects. Collectively, these combined approaches should enhance therapeutic efficacy and outcome in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Niewerth, Denise', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Niewerth D', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG', 'Zweegman S', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Rheumatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Lab, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

In preclinical studies, ibrutinib potently bound to Btk, inhibited BCR signaling, and decreased tumor cell proliferation and survival in many B-cell malignancy models. Excellent safety and efficacy data in clinical trials have led to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of ibrutinib for previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as CLL with 17p deletion. Ongoing clinical studies have also demonstrated great potency of ibrutinib in treating other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM).

These findings suggest that in cases with marked leukocytosis the accuracy of ESR should be confirmed with the appearance of the test tube.","['Nojiri, Takahiro', 'Masuda, Akiko', 'Ohkawa, Ryunosuke', 'Koido, Kiyoko', 'Shimosaka, Hironori', 'Okubo, Shigeo', 'Yokota, Hiromitsu', 'Kurano, Makoto', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Ikeda, Hitoshi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Yatomi, Yutaka']","['Nojiri T', 'Masuda A', 'Ohkawa R', 'Koido K', 'Shimosaka H', 'Okubo S', 'Yokota H', 'Kurano M', 'Nannya Y', 'Ikeda H', 'Kurokawa M', 'Yatomi Y']",,['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

In this study we examined if ROS production in Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60) differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (dHL60) induces ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). To cause ROS production cells were treated with PMA or by chronic hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia failed to induce ROS production and did not cause activation of the UPR in dHL60 cells. PMA, a pharmacologic NADPH oxidase activator, induced ER stress in dHL60 cells as monitored by IRE-1 and PERK pathway activation, and this was independent of calcium signaling. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI, abolished both ROS production and UPR activation. These results show that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase induces ER stress and suggests a close association between the redox state of the cell and the activation of the UPR in neutrophil-like HL60 cells.","['Kuwabara, Wilson Mitsuo Tatagiba', 'Zhang, Liling', 'Schuiki, Irmgard', 'Curi, Rui', 'Volchuk, Allen', 'Alba-Loureiro, Tatiana Carolina']","['Kuwabara WM', 'Zhang L', 'Schuiki I', 'Curi R', 'Volchuk A', 'Alba-Loureiro TC']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*physiology']",PMC4323339,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116410 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-29943 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 10;10(2):e0116410. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116410. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase II trial of post-transplantation CY (post-CY) after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) using intravenous busulfan (area under the curve of 4000 micromolar minute), fludarabine (40 mg/m(2)) for 4 days, and CY 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4 after BM or peripheral blood (PB) transplantations from matched related (MRD) or unrelated donors (MUD). MUD recipients received antithymocyte globulin (ATG); however, a later amendment removed ATG. Forty-nine patients were treated (acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 82%). Median age was 62 years (range, 39 to 72). Fifteen patients received an MRD (9 PB/6 BM); 34 had a MUD (2 PB/32 BM). The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD, III to IV acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD was 58%, 22%, and 18%, respectively. A matched cohort analysis compared outcomes to tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis and indicated higher rates of acute GVHD grade II to IV (46% versus 19%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P = .02) and treatment-related mortality (HR, 3.3; P = .035) and worse overall survival (HR, 1.9; P = .04) with post-CY.

Macrophages play a dichotomous role in cancer, where they promote tumor growth but also serve as critical immune effectors of therapeutic antibodies. Macrophages express all classes of Fcgamma receptors, and they have immense potential to destroy tumors via the process of antibody-dependent phagocytosis. A number of studies have demonstrated that macrophage phagocytosis is a major mechanism of action of many antibodies approved to treat cancer. Consequently, a number of approaches to augment macrophage responses to therapeutic antibodies are under investigation, including the exploration of new targets and development of antibodies with enhanced functions. For example, the interaction of CD47 with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) serves as a myeloid-specific immune checkpoint that limits the response of macrophages to antibody therapies, and CD47-blocking agents overcome this barrier to augment phagocytosis. The response of macrophages to antibody therapies can also be enhanced with engineered Fc variants, bispecific antibodies, or antibody-drug conjugates. Macrophages have demonstrated success as effectors of cancer immunotherapy, and further investigation will unlock their full potential for the benefit of patients.","['Weiskopf, Kipp', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Weiskopf K', 'Weissman IL']","['a Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine ; Stanford University School of Medicine ; Stanford , CA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*immunology', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology', 'Phagocytosis/*drug effects', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology']",PMC4622600,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19420862.2015.1011450 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2015;7(2):303-10. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2015.1011450.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADC, antibody-drug conjugate', 'ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity', 'ADCP', 'ADCP, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis', 'AML, acute myelogenous leukemia', ""BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'CD, cluster of differentiation', 'CD47', 'CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Fc receptor', 'Fc, fragment crystallizable', 'FcgammaR, Fcgamma receptors', 'GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor', 'HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2', 'HSC, haematopoietic stem cell', 'ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif', 'ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif', 'IgG, immunoglobulin G', 'M-CSF, macrophage colony stimulating factor', 'NK, natural killer', 'SHP, Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase', 'SIRPalpha', 'SIRPalpha, signal-regulatory protein alpha', 'antibodies', 'cancer', 'immune checkpoint', 'immunotherapy', 'macrophages', 'phagocytosis']",['F30CA168059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were infected by pRNAi-siHO-1-GFP. The viability of the BMMNCs was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay following daunorubicin (DNR) treatment. The apoptotic rate was detected by flow cytometry. The expression levels of HO-1 and apoptosis-related genes were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. An AML-M2 xenograft mouse model was established. The tumor formation outcomes and survival were observed. The leukocyte and platelet counts and hemoglobin levels were monitored, and the copy numbers of AML1/ETO fusion gene were detected by qPCR. pRNAi-siHO-1-GFP silenced the expression of HO-1. DNR inhibited cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The survival rate of the cells was significantly reduced by infection with pRNAi-siHO-1-GFP. HO-1 expression in the BMMNCs infected with pRNAi-siHO-1-GFP was downregulated, whereas caspase-3, -8 and -9 expression was upregulated compared with that in control BMMNCs. Kasumi-1 cells were successfully inoculated into nude mice. The rats inoculated with pRNAi-siHO-1-GFP-transfected Kasumi-1 cells succumbed to tumors more slowly and survived longer than those inoculated with untransfected Kasumi-1 cells. Furthermore, the leukocyte and platelet counts and hemoglobin levels were higher and the copy numbers of AML1/ETO fusion gene were lower in the former group. HO-1 gene silencing may promote the apoptosis of human M2 leukemic cells by inhibiting a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Targeted silencing of HO-1 is able to inhibit the proliferation and infiltration of leukemic cells in nude mice and thus prolong their survival. The findings provide valuable experimental evidence for the molecular targeted therapy of M2 leukemia.","['Wei, Sixi', 'Wang, Yating', 'Chai, Qixiang', 'Fang, Qin', 'Zhang, Yaming', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Wei S', 'Wang Y', 'Chai Q', 'Fang Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, P.R.

Conventional chemotherapy agents that aim to kill tumor cells may also damage normal cells and thus result in severe side-effects. Naringenin, a natural polyphenolic compound with antioxidant effects, has been revealed to have significant antitumor effects with low toxicity in preliminary studies. Thus, it is considered as one of the most promising flavonoids in the treatment of leukemia. In the present study, the effects of naringenin on the K562 human leukemia cell line and the underlying mechanisms were explored in vitro. In addition, human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were used as a normal control in order to evaluate the effects of naringenin on normal granulocytes and in the mediation of Adriamycin (ADM)-induced oxidative damage. The results revealed that K562 proliferation was significantly inhibited by naringenin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner; however, minimal cytotoxic effects were observed in PMNs when naringenin was used at concentrations <400 mumol/l. Morphological changes indicative of apoptosis were observed in naringenin-treated K562 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the K562 cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle with a significantly upregulated rate of apoptosis. Furthermore, in the naringenin-treated K562 cells, the labeling index of proliferating cell nuclear antigen was observed to be increased by immunochemical staining, the mRNA and protein expression levels of p21/WAF1 were strongly upregulated in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, whereas p53 gene expression was not significantly changed. In PMNs to which naringenin (50~80 mumol/l) was added 1 h subsequent to ADM, the cell damage induced by ADM was significantly reduced, coincident with reductions in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increases in the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. However, the cytotoxic effect of ADM in K562 cells was not significantly altered by naringenin, and the oxidative stress indices in K562 cells remained stable. In conclusion, the present study revealed the promising value of naringenin in leukemia treatment. Naringenin demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of K562 cells but not on normal PMNs. Furthermore, naringenin protected PMNs from ADM-induced oxidative damage at low concentrations. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing effects, achieved through p53-independent p21/WAF1 upregulation, are likely to be the mechanism of the antileukemic effects of naringenin, and the protective effect against ADM chemotherapy-induced damage in PMNs may be due to the antioxidant capability of this agent at low concentrations.","['Li, Rui-Fang', 'Feng, Ying-Qian', 'Chen, Jun-Hui', 'Ge, Lin-Tong', 'Xiao, Shu-Yuan', 'Zuo, Xue-Lan']","['Li RF', 'Feng YQ', 'Chen JH', 'Ge LT', 'Xiao SY', 'Zuo XL']","['Department of Neurology, Hubei Zhongshan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430033, P.R.

It is well known that piRNAs can maintain genome integrity via silencing retrotransposons. Previous studies on the animal models harboring gene deletions have shown that the genes involved in piRNA biogenesis and their defective expression can result in the spermatogenic dysfunction. In the past decade, significant progress has been achieved for piRNAs and their roles in male germ cells. This review addresses the advances on piRNAs and piRNA biogenesis-associated genes, with a particular focus on the Moloney leukemia virus 10-like 1 (MOV10L1) gene, whose role in primary piRNA processing and in the 'ping-pong' cycle during secondary piRNA processing has been illustrated. The biological characteristics of piRNA has been summarized, and emphasis was laid on the roles of MOV10L1 in the mediation of piRNA biogenesis and retrotransposons silencing by DNA methylation. Furthermore, the association between MOV10L1 gene polymorphisms and complete maturation arrest in men has been discussed. Hence, thorough literature review was conducted in order to obtain a greater understanding of the function of MOV10L1 and its mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis in mice and humans.","['Zhu, Xiaobin', 'Zhi, Erlei', 'Li, Zheng']","['Zhu X', 'Zhi E', 'Li Z']","['Department of UrologySchool of Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of UrologySchool of Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of UrologySchool of Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Shanghai 200127, China lizhengboshi@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150209,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Mov10l1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'RNA Helicases/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Spermatogenesis/*physiology', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/*metabolism']",,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-14-0569 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-14-0569 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2015 May;149(5):R229-35. doi: 10.1530/REP-14-0569.

In the last decade the anticancer potential of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors became apparent and now several PARP inhibitors are being developed to treat various malignancies. So far, the usage of PARP inhibitors has been mainly focused on the treatment of solid tumors and not too much about their efficacy on leukemias is known. In this study we test, for the first time on leukemic cells, a combined therapy that associates the conventional chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (5FU), used as a source of DNA damage, and a PARP inhibitor, rucaparib. We demonstrate the efficacy and the specificity of this combined therapy in killing both acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. We clearly show that the inhibition of DNA repair induced by rucaparib is synthetic lethal with the DNA damage caused by 5FU in leukemic cells. Therefore, we propose a new therapeutic strategy able to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DNA-damaging agents in leukemia cells via inhibiting the repair of damaged DNA.","['Falzacappa, Maria Vittoria Verga', 'Ronchini, Chiara', 'Faretta, Mario', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Di Rora, Andrea Ghelli Luserna', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Meyer, Luder Hinrich', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Orecchioni, Stefania', 'Bertolini, Francesco', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Falzacappa MV', 'Ronchini C', 'Faretta M', 'Iacobucci I', 'Di Rora AG', 'Martinelli G', 'Meyer LH', 'Debatin KM', 'Orecchioni S', 'Bertolini F', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. vittoria.falzacappa@ieo.eu piergiuseppe.pelicci@ieo.eu.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

Haplo-cord SCT also has a low incidence of early non-relapse mortality, low incidences of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and excellent graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effects. Favorable long-term outcomes for high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies have been reported, including older patients. Haplo-cord SCT will likely overcome the limitations of cell dose during cord stem cell selection and might significantly expand the use of cord stem cell transplant in the adult population. The comparable survival outcomes of matched related donor (MRD), matched unrelated donor (MUD), and haplo-cord stem cell transplant strongly argue that haplo-cord SCT should be considered as effective alternative stem cell transplant for high-risk patients lacking standard donors. Further improvement in supportive care and incorporation of a better understanding of the human fetal immune development into the haplo-cord SCT are required to further improve this strategy.","['Liu, Hongtao', 'van Besien, Koen']","['Liu H', 'van Besien K']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, hliu2@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Chimerism', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-014-0245-y [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2015 Mar;10(1):1-7. doi: 10.1007/s11899-014-0245-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to determine whether cytoskeletal-directed agents that either disrupt (cytochalasin B and vincristine) or rigidify (jasplakinolide and paclitaxel) microfilaments and microtubules, respectively, affect ultrasonic sensitivity. U937 human monocytic leukemia cell populations were treated with each cytoskeletal-directed agent alone, and then sonicated at 23.5 kHz under relatively low power and intensity (20-40 W; 10-20 W/cm(2)), or at 20 kHz using moderate power and intensity (60 W; 80 W/cm(2)). In addition, human leukemia lines U937, THP1, K562, and Molt-4, and the murine leukemia line L1210 were sonicated using pulsed 20 kHz ultrasound (80.6 W; 107.5 W/cm(2)) both with and without the addition of cytoskeletal-directed agents to assess whether cytoskeletal-directed agents can potentiate ultrasonic sensitivity in different leukemia lines. Human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs) and leukocytes were sonicated with continuous 23.5 kHz ultrasound (20 W; 10 W/cm(2)) to determine whether this approach elicited the preferential damage of neoplastic cells over normal blood components. To determine whether ultrasonic sensitivity is exclusively dependent on cell size, leukemia cells were also enlarged via alteration of cell growth parameters including serum deprivation and re-addition, and plateau-phase subculturing. Results indicated that cytochalasin B/ultrasound treatments had the highest rates of initial U937 cell damage. The cells enlarged and partially synchronized, either by serum deprivation and re-addition or by plateau-phase subculturing and synchronous release, were not comparably sensitive to ultrasonic destruction based solely on their cell size. In addition, cytochalasin B significantly potentiated the ultrasonic sensitivity of all neoplastic cell lines, but not in normal blood cells, suggesting that preferential damage is attainable with this treatment protocol. Therefore, it is likely that ultrasonic cell lysis depends not only on cell size and type, but also on the specific molecular mechanisms used to induce cell enlargement and their effects on cell integrity. This is supported by the fact that either the microfilament-or microtubule-disrupting agent produced a higher rate of lysis for cells of a given size than the corresponding stabilizing agents.","['Trendowski, Matthew', 'Wong, Victoria', 'Zoino, Joseph N', 'Christen, Timothy D', 'Gadeberg, Lauren', 'Sansky, Michelle', 'Fondy, Thomas P']","['Trendowski M', 'Wong V', 'Zoino JN', 'Christen TD', 'Gadeberg L', 'Sansky M', 'Fondy TP']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY 13244, USA.

CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old female with no past medical history presented complaining of mild abdominal pain, fever, and chills for the past day. On examination, she was tachycardic and febrile, with mild tenderness of her right lower quadrant and without signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory examination revealed pancytopenia and DIC, with a fibrinogen level of 290 mg/dL. CT of the abdomen showed a thickened and hyperemic appendix without perforation or abscess, compatible with acute appendicitis. The patient was given IV broad-spectrum antibiotics and was transfused with packed red blood cells and platelets. She underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy and bone marrow biopsy, which revealed neoplastic cells of 90% of the total bone marrow cellularity. Flow cytometry indicated presence of 92.4% of immature myeloid cells with t (15: 17) and q (22: 12) mutations, and FISH analysis for PML-RARA demonstrated a long-form fusion transcript, positive for APL. Appendix pathology described leukemic infiltration with co-expression of myeloperoxidase and CD68, consistent with myeloid sarcoma of the appendix. The patient completed a course of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and all trans-retinoic acid. Repeat bone marrow biopsy demonstrated complete remission. She will follow up with her primary care physician and hematologist/oncologist. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid sarcoma of the appendix in the setting of APL is very rare and it might play a role in the development of acute appendicitis. Urgent management, including bone marrow biopsy for definitive diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention, dramatically improve prognosis.","['Rodriguez, Eduardo A', 'Lopez, Marvin A', 'Valluri, Kartik', 'Wang, Danlu', 'Fischer, Andrew', 'Perdomo, Tatiana']","['Rodriguez EA', 'Lopez MA', 'Valluri K', 'Wang D', 'Fischer A', 'Perdomo T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miami Palm Beach Regional Campus, Atlantis, FL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miami Palm Beach Regional Campus, Atlantis, FL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miami Palm Beach Regional Campus, Atlantis, FL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miami Palm Beach Regional Campus, Atlantis, FL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miami Palm Beach Regional Campus, Atlantis, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, JFK Medical Center, Atlantis, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150210,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Adult', 'Appendectomy/methods', 'Appendicitis/diagnosis/*etiology/surgery', 'Appendix/*pathology/surgery', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*complications/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",PMC4327184,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/10/02 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['892760 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.892760 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2015 Feb 10;16:73-6. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.892760.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hck is expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, specifically myelomonocytic cells and B lymphocytes. It participates in phagocytosis, adhesion, migration, regulation of protrusion formation on cell membrane, lysosome exocytosis, podosome formation and actin polymerization. More importantly from a medicinal chemistry point of view, high levels of Hck are involved in chronic myeloid leukemia and other hematologic tumors. Furthermore, Hck activity has been associated with virus infections including HIV-1. In particular, Hck is activated by the HIV-1 accessory protein Nef, a multifunctional HIV-1 protein that accelerates progression to AIDS and enhances the infectivity of progeny viruses. Nef binding to Hck leads to kinase activation which is important in AIDS pathogenesis. For these reasons, Hck represents a potentially good therapeutic target for the treatment of both specific cancers and HIV infection. This article summarizes Hck biological activities connected with malignancies and HIV infection, many of which have been only recently reported, and presents an overview of the compounds endowed with Hck inhibitory activity, especially focusing on the medicinal chemistry aspect.","['Musumeci, F', 'Schenone, S', 'Brullo, C', 'Desogus, A', 'Botta, L', 'Tintori, C']","['Musumeci F', 'Schenone S', 'Brullo C', 'Desogus A', 'Botta L', 'Tintori C']","['Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Viale Benedetto XV, 3, I-16132, Genova, Italy. schensil@unige.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Discovery', 'HIV Infections/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/01/14 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-65085 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867322666150209152057 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2015;22(13):1540-64. doi: 10.2174/0929867322666150209152057.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of As2O3 on vasomotion in rat aortic rings using isometric tension recordings and ECG in anesthetized rats. The results showed that As2O3 (10(-5) M) significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the frequency of acetylcholine (10(-5) M ACh)- and KCl (10 mM)-induced vasomotion, and it also increased the relaxation time (R t) of vasomotion. This effect was restored by 10(-8) M sodium nitroprusside (nitric oxide donor). ACh-induced NO release in the aorta was blunted in the presence of As2O3. The corrected QT interval (QTc) of the ECG, and time dilation (T d) of the pulse wave in the tail artery of the anesthetized rat were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the arsenic-treated group (50 ppb As) versus control. In conclusion, data suggest that arsenic-induced reduction in vasomotion frequency of the isolated aortic rings is associated with a decreased bioavailability of NO, an increase in QTc and a decrease in the frequency of the pulse wave generated by the cardiac cycle in anesthetized rats.","['Cifuentes, Fredi', 'Palacios, Javier', 'Nwokocha, Chukwuemeka R']","['Cifuentes F', 'Palacios J', 'Nwokocha CR']","['Experimental Physiology Laboratory (EPhyL), Instituto Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Quimicas y Farmaceuticas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Arturo Prat, 1110939, Iquique, Chile. palacios.unap@gmail.com.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences Physiology Section, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, Mona, Kingston 7, Jamaica, W.I.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cardiovasc Toxicol,Cardiovascular toxicology,101135818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Acetylcholine/pharmacology', 'Anesthesia', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Aorta/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Electrocardiography/drug effects', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/*drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/pharmacology', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology']",,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12012-015-9312-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12012-015-9312-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2016 Jan;16(1):79-88. doi: 10.1007/s12012-015-9312-4.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aorta rat', 'Arsenic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'K+ channels', 'Nitric oxide', 'Pulse wave', 'Vasomotion']",,,,,,,['Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2016 Jan;16(1):89.

Steady progress has led to significant improvements with CAR design and CAR T-cell production, allowing evaluation of CAR T cells in patients. The initial trials have targeted CD19, which is expressed on normal and malignant B cells. AREAS COVERED: We review data from trials for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In addition, we discuss the on-target toxicities, B-cell aplasia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is uniquely associated with T-cell immunotherapies. EXPERT OPINION: We compare the results when targeting the same antigen in CLL or B-ALL and speculate on reasons for outcome differences and future directions to enhance outcomes. Furthermore, the dramatic results targeting B-ALL require further analysis in Phase II trials, and we discuss important components of these future trials. We also suggest a management scheme for CRS. The next several years will be critical and may lead to the first clinical indication of a gene-engineered cell therapy for cancer.","['Bouhassira, Diana C G', 'Thompson, Joshua J', 'Davila, Marco L']","['Bouhassira DC', 'Thompson JJ', 'Davila ML']","['University of Chicago School of Medicine , Chicago, IL , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150209,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",PMC4586131,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2015.1014792 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015 Mar;15(3):403-16. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2015.1014792.

Myelopathy as a complication of intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is rare in adults, with most of the cases described in the literature occurring in the pediatric population. Between January 2010 and March 2014, 587 newly diagnosed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 24 chronic myeloid leukemia lymphoid blast phase patients were seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This case series discusses seven adult cases deemed to have IT chemotherapy-induced myelopathy between 2010 and 2014 at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Five out of the seven patients had T2 abnormalities involving the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. An elevated myelin basic protein level was noted in the two patients in whom it was checked. The wide range of dosage and timing with respect to IT chemotherapy administration suggests an idiosyncratic reaction or individual threshold to the development of myelopathy. By describing the largest case series of myelopathy in adults, we aim to raise awareness about this rare albeit devastating complication. Based on the seven cases described we would recommend-MRI of the spine with T2-weighted imaging in the sagittal and axial planes in leukemia patients with unexplained myelopathy and consideration to delay IT chemotherapy until after an extensive work-up to rule out CNS leukemia. Though more data are needed on the use of folate metabolites, preliminary results have shown some promise in the treatment of methotrexate-induced myelopathy and may be a potential consideration for future patients suspected to have chemotherapy induced myelopathy.","['Cachia, David', 'Kamiya-Matsuoka, Carlos', 'Pinnix, Chelsea C', 'Chi, Linda', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Daver, Naval', 'Woodman, Karin']","['Cachia D', 'Kamiya-Matsuoka C', 'Pinnix CC', 'Chi L', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes JE', 'Daver N', 'Woodman K']","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA, dcachia@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Study', 'Journal Article']",20150210,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MBP protein, human)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology']",PMC4369460,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-015-1727-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2015 Apr;122(2):391-8. doi: 10.1007/s11060-015-1727-z.

The patient BMSCs had lower proliferative activity than that of the controls due to increased senescence. This retarded proliferation induced failure to obtain enough metaphase cells for karyotyping in patient BMSCs (10%). Patient BMSCs were genetically altered which was demonstrated by chromosome abnormalities in 5% of the patients (one MDS and three AML), whereas no clonal abnormalities were detected in the controls. The most common abnormality of the BMSCs was an extra chromosome 5, followed by an extra chromosome 7 and balanced translocations. The proportion of the abnormal metaphase cells was low (17.8%). We also analyzed the epigenetic changes of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) repetitive element and CDKN2B using pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of global LINE-1 methylation demonstrated that patient BMSCs revealed global hypomethylation (68.2+/-3.8) compared with controls (72.9+/-3.4, P<0.001) and that the global hypomethylation of BMSCs were more significant in AML than in MDS patients (67.9+/-3.8, 69.4+/-4.2, respectively). These findings seem worthy of further evaluation of their association with ineffective hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.","['Kim, Yonggoo', 'Jekarl, Dong Wook', 'Kim, Jiyeon', 'Kwon, Ahlm', 'Choi, Hayoung', 'Lee, Seungok', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Yonghwan', 'Oh, Il-Hoan', 'Kim, Myungshin']","['Kim Y', 'Jekarl DW', 'Kim J', 'Kwon A', 'Choi H', 'Lee S', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim Y', 'Oh IH', 'Kim M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Life Systems, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center, Research Center for Stem Cell Therapeutics Evaluation, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

BLV can interact with telomerase and inhibits telomere shortening, contributing in leukemogenesis and tumour induction. The role of telomerase in BLV-induced lymphosarcoma and aging has been extensively studied. To date, the interaction of both BLV and aging on telomerase mis-regulation have, however, not been investigated. In the present study, telomerase activity in BLV positive and negative cows was compared over a wide range of ages (11-85 months). Lymphocyte counts were also measured in both BLV positive and negative groups. Telomerase activity was detected in all BLV infected animals with persistent lymphocytosis (PL), especially in older individuals. This study revealed that the cells undergo the natural telomerase shortening even in the presence of an existing viral infection. We also show that viral infection, especially during the PL phase of the disease, increases telomerase activity. A statistically significant interaction between age and viral infection was observed for telomere shortening during BLV infection. Older animals with BLV infection, especially those with persistent lymphocytosis or visible tumors, exhibited a sharp increase in telomerase activity. This study demonstrates that there is a significant interaction between BLV infection and telomerase up-regulation and lymphocytosis.","['Hemmatzadeh, Farhid', 'Keyvanfar, Hadi', 'Hasan, Noor Haliza', 'Niap, Faustina', 'Bani Hassan, Ebrahim', 'Hematzade, Azar', 'Ebrahimie, Esmaeil', 'McWhorter, Andrea', 'Ignjatovic, Jagoda']","['Hemmatzadeh F', 'Keyvanfar H', 'Hasan NH', 'Niap F', 'Bani Hassan E', 'Hematzade A', 'Ebrahimie E', 'McWhorter A', 'Ignjatovic J']","['School of Animal and Veterinary Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia, farhid.hemmatzadeh@adelaide.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150211,Netherlands,Vet Res Commun,Veterinary research communications,8100520,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*enzymology/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/physiology', 'Telomerase/*genetics/*metabolism']",,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11259-015-9629-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Res Commun. 2015 Jun;39(2):97-103. doi: 10.1007/s11259-015-9629-2.

The multi-targeted kinase inhibitor sorafenib is efficacious in AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), but resistance to therapy is an important clinical problem. It is unclear whether AML lacking FLT3-ITD responds to sorafenib. Using AML cell lines, we have shown that a low concentration of sorafenib induces opposing effects depending on the oncogenic background. In FLT3-ITD positive cells sorafenib blocks Erk activity and cell proliferation, and triggers apoptosis. However, in cells lacking FLT3-ITD, sorafenib paradoxically activates Erk2, and stimulates cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. Thus, depending on the genetic context, sorafenib is a beneficial inhibitor or paradoxical activator of mitogenic signaling pathways in AML. These results harbor important consequences in planning clinical trials in AML.","['Fouladi, Fariba', 'Jehn, Lutz B', 'Metzelder, Stephan K', 'Hub, Florian', 'Henkenius, Katharina', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Brendel, Cornelia', 'Stiewe, Thorsten', 'Neubauer, Andreas']","['Fouladi F', 'Jehn LB', 'Metzelder SK', 'Hub F', 'Henkenius K', 'Burchert A', 'Brendel C', 'Stiewe T', 'Neubauer A']","['a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.', 'a Klinik fur Innere Medizin und Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg , Marburg , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150303,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorafenib', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics', 'raf Kinases/metabolism']",PMC4732463,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2015/02/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.1003055 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(9):2690-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.1003055.

During differentiation of human teratocarcinoma cells, ZRF1 promotes transcriptional induction of developmental genes that are repressed by Polycomb complexes. Importantly, ZRF1 has recently been shown to be required for both neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and for maintenance of neural progenitor cell (NPC) identity. Moreover, a dual role has now emerged for ZRF1 in cancer: on the one hand, ZRF1 plays a crucial role in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) by activating the INK4/ARF locus, thus working as a tumor suppressor; on the other hand, ZRF1 promotes leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a Polycomb-independent fashion. Therefore, increasing evidence points to ZRF1 as a novel target for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.","['Aloia, Luigi', 'Demajo, Santiago', 'Di Croce, Luciano']","['Aloia L', 'Demajo S', 'Di Croce L']","['a Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) ; Barcelona , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNAJC2 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA-Binding Proteins']",PMC4615000,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.988022 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(4):510-5. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.988022.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'ESC, embryonic stem cells', 'H2Aub1, mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A', 'HDAC, histone deacetylase', 'NPC, neural progenitor cells', 'OIS, oncogene-induced senescence', 'PRC1, polycomb repressive complex 1', 'PRC2, polycomb repressive complex 2', 'RA, retinoic acid', 'RARa, retinoic acid receptor a', 'UBD, ubiquitin binding domain', 'ZRF1', 'cancer', 'cell fate', 'development', 'differentiation', 'epigenetics', 'polycomb', 'retinoic acid', 'senescence', 'stem cell', 'transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
