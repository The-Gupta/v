A number of these dietary monoterpenes have antitumor activity. For example, d-limonene, which comprises >90% of orange peel oil, has chemopreventive activity against rodent mammary, skin, liver, lung and forestomach cancers. Similarly, other dietary monoterpenes have chemopreventive activity against rat mammary, lung and forestomach cancers when fed during the initiation phase. In addition, perillyl alcohol has promotion phase chemopreventive activity against rat liver cancer, and geraniol has in vivo antitumor activity against murine leukemia cells. Perillyl alcohol and d-limonene also have chemotherapeutic activity against rodent mammary and pancreatic tumors. As a result, their cancer chemotherapeutic activities are under evaluation in Phase I clinical trials. Several mechanisms of action may account for the antitumor activities of monoterpenes. The blocking chemopreventive effects of limonene and other monoterpenes during the initiation phase of mammary carcinogenesis are likely due to the induction of Phase II carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, resulting in carcinogen detoxification. The post-initiation phase, tumor suppressive chemopreventive activity of monoterpenes may be due to the induction of apoptosis and/or to inhibition of the post-translational isoprenylation of cell growth-regulating proteins. Chemotherapy of chemically induced mammary tumors with monoterpenes results in tumor redifferentiation concomitant with increased expression of the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor and transforming growth factor beta1. Thus, monoterpenes would appear to act through multiple mechanisms in the chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer.","['Crowell, P L']",['Crowell PL'],"['Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '319R5C7293 (perillyl alcohol)', '9MC3I34447 (Limonene)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anticarcinogenic Agents', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cyclohexenes', '*Diet', 'Limonene', '*Monoterpenes', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Rats', 'Terpenes/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",64,1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/129.3.775S [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 1999 Mar;129(3):775S-778S. doi: 10.1093/jn/129.3.775S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that HOX-9 and HOX-10 paralog proteins are unique among HOX homeodomain proteins in their capacity to form in vitro cooperative DNA binding complexes with either the PBX or MEIS protein. Furthermore, PBX and MEIS proteins have been shown to form in vivo heterodimeric DNA binding complexes with each other. We now show that in vitro DNA site selection for MEIS1 in the presence of HOXA9 and PBX yields a consensus PBX-HOXA9 site. MEIS1 enhances in vitro HOXA9-PBX protein complex formation in the absence of DNA and forms a trimeric electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) complex with these proteins on an oligonucleotide containing a PBX-HOXA9 site. Myeloid cell nuclear extracts produce EMSA complexes which appear to contain HOXA9, PBX2, and MEIS1, while immunoprecipitation of HOXA9 from these extracts results in coprecipitation of PBX2 and MEIS1. In myeloid cells, HOXA9, MEIS1, and PBX2 are all strongly expressed in the nucleus, where a portion of their signals are colocalized within nuclear speckles. However, cotransfection of HOXA9 and PBX2 with or without MEIS1 minimally influences transcription of a reporter gene containing multiple PBX-HOXA9 binding sites. Taken together, these data suggest that in myeloid leukemia cells MEIS1 forms trimeric complexes with PBX and HOXA9, which in turn can bind to consensus PBX-HOXA9 DNA targets.","['Shen, W F', 'Rozenfeld, S', 'Kwong, A', 'Kom ves, L G', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Largman, C']","['Shen WF', 'Rozenfeld S', 'Kwong A', 'Kom ves LG', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Largman C']","['Departments of Medicine, University of California VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA. largman@cgl.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PBX2 protein, human)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Dimerization', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.4.3051 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Apr;19(4):3051-61. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.4.3051.,"['R01 DK048642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC84099,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene is highly expressed in the yolk sac and fetal liver of the knockin mice. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that its cDNA contains an 1,107-bp open reading frame encoding a 368-amino-acid polypeptide. Further protein sequence and protein translation analysis shows that it belongs to a family of ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP), and its molecular mass is 43 kDa. Therefore, we have named this gene UBP43. Like other ubiquitin proteases, the UBP43 protein has deubiquitinating enzyme activity. Protein ubiquitination has been implicated in many important cellular events. In wild-type adult mice, UBP43 is highly expressed in the thymus and in peritoneal macrophages. Among nine different murine hematopoietic cell lines analyzed, UBP43 expression is detectable only in cell lines related to the monocytic lineage. Furthermore, its expression is regulated during cytokine-induced monocytic cell differentiation. We have investigated its function in the hematopoietic myeloid cell line M1. UBP43 was introduced into M1 cells by retroviral gene transfer, and several high-expressing UBP43 clones were obtained for further study. Morphologic and cell surface marker examination of UBP43/M1 cells reveals that overexpression of UBP43 blocks cytokine-induced terminal differentiation of monocytic cells. These data suggest that UBP43 plays an important role in hematopoiesis by modulating either the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway or the ubiquitination state of another regulatory factor(s) during myeloid cell differentiation.","['Liu, L Q', 'Ilaria, R Jr', 'Kingsley, P D', 'Iwama, A', 'van Etten, R A', 'Palis, J', 'Zhang, D E']","['Liu LQ', 'Ilaria R Jr', 'Kingsley PD', 'Iwama A', 'van Etten RA', 'Palis J', 'Zhang DE']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.- (Usp18 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Endopeptidases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",,1999/03/19 03:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/03/19 03:04'],"['1999/03/19 03:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 03:04 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.4.3029 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Apr;19(4):3029-38. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.4.3029.,"['CA/AI59589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL059484/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59484-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA072009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA/72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC84097,['GENBANK/AF069502'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modifications include acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and ADP-ribosylation, but the biological significance of each of these is not well understood. For example, distinct acetylation patterns correlate with nucleosome formation and with transcriptionally activated or silenced chromatin, yet mutations in genes encoding several yeast histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities result in either no cellular phenotype or only modest growth defects. Here we report characterization of ESA1, an essential gene that is a member of the MYST family that includes two yeast silencing genes, human genes associated with leukemia and with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein, and Drosophila mof, a gene essential for male dosage compensation. Esa1p acetylates histones in a pattern distinct from those of other yeast enzymes, and temperature-sensitive mutant alleles abolish enzymatic activity in vitro and result in partial loss of an acetylated isoform of histone H4 in vivo. Strains carrying these mutations are also blocked in the cell cycle such that at restrictive temperatures, esa1 mutants succeed in replicating their DNA but fail to proceed normally through mitosis and cytokinesis. Recent studies show that Esa1p enhances transcription in vitro and thus may modulate expression of genes important for cell cycle control. These observations therefore link an essential HAT activity to cell cycle progression, potentially through discrete transcriptional regulatory events.","['Clarke, A S', 'Lowell, J E', 'Jacobson, S J', 'Pillus, L']","['Clarke AS', 'Lowell JE', 'Jacobson SJ', 'Pillus L']","['Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0347, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Esa1 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (mof protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', '*Drosophila Proteins', '*Genes, Essential', '*Genes, Fungal', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*cytology', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.4.2515 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Apr;19(4):2515-26. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.4.2515.,,PMC84044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mismatched and unrelated donor transplants are common, demanding an increased vigilance to detect incipient graft failure, secondary lymphoma as well as relapse and other problems, which now are potentially treatable. To diagnose these complications it may be important to know whether blood and marrow cells are of recipient or donor origin. To evaluate the role of mixed donor-recipient chimerism in relation to clinical problems we adapted a polymerase chain-reaction technique, using fluorescent primers analyzing DNA fragment length polymorphisms, to follow prospectively 17 bone marrow grafted children. To increase the precision of chimerism analysis, immunomagnetically isolated leukocyte populations were assayed in selected cases. Five patients encountered clinical problems related to chimerism. One infant with adenosine deaminase deficiency failed to engraft stem cells, yet succumbed to graft-versus-host disease, mediated by mature donor T-cells. Three children developed significant mixed chimerism. One of these three patients died in relapse of leukemia, while the two other patients who had received T-cell depleted grafts had persistent recipient T-cells, in spite of engraftment. After 5 months, these were displaced by donor T-cells in one of the patients. In the fifth patient, also after T-cell depleted BMT, a fatal donor cell lymphoma occurred. Twelve children had stable full chimerism or in one case a low grade mixed chimerism and remain disease-free throughout follow up (median 9 months). In conclusion, the analysis of chimerism, particularly of separated leukocyte populations, offers an almost indispensable insight and a basis for therapeutic decisions in complicated situations such as grafting involving unrelated or mismatched donors, graft manipulation, adoptive immunotherapy and in immunodeficiency patients.","['Winiarski, J', 'Mattsson, J', 'Gustafsson, A', 'Wester, D', 'Borgstrom, B', 'Ringden, O', 'Ljungman, P', 'Dalianis, T']","['Winiarski J', 'Mattsson J', 'Gustafsson A', 'Wester D', 'Borgstrom B', 'Ringden O', 'Ljungman P', 'Dalianis T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 1998 May;2(2):150-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the distribution of CD4 in T-cell membranes and found that approximately 10% of the CD4 co-receptor is associated with detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains, whilst the remaining 90% is in soluble membranes. Moreover, approximately 60% of the ""insoluble CD4"" is present in membrane microdomains containing GPI-anchored proteins and high glycolipid-dependent kinase activity, whereas the remaining 40% displays no association with GPI-anchored proteins and lacks glycolipid-associated kinase activity These results indicate that CD4 segregates at least into three different membrane microenvironments: 1) soluble membranes; 2) insoluble membrane microdomains containing GPI-anchored proteins; and 3) insoluble membrane microdomains devoid of GPI-anchored proteins. The level of CD4 in insoluble membranes was not modified upon triggering activation by T-cell receptor-crosslinking but detectable amounts of CD3 subunits were recruited into these specialized membranes under those conditions. The physical separation of CD4 into different membrane microenvironments raises the possibility of that some of the multiple functions of CD4 might segregate into distinct types of lipid microenvironment. The fact that components of T-cell receptor/CD3 complex were recruited into insoluble membranes upon stimulation is consistent with the CD4 present in this membrane fraction might participate in T-cell receptor-triggered activation events.","['Millan, J', 'Cerny, J', 'Horejsi, V', 'Alonso, M A']","['Millan J', 'Cerny J', 'Horejsi V', 'Alonso MA']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/*isolation & purification', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'CD59 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/immunology', 'Detergents/*pharmacology', 'Glycolipids/analysis', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Lipids/analysis', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Octoxynol/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/immunology', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1399-0039.1999.530104.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1999 Jan;53(1):33-40. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-0039.1999.530104.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In C57 B1/6 mice, infection with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus leads to a syndrome (murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-MAIDS) characterized by immunocompromise, neurochemical alterations, and learning and memory deficits. Because the neurochemical and behavioral changes suggest that altered glutamatergic neurotransmission follows LP-BM5 infection, we studied the effects of infection on discriminative stimulus properties of phencyclidine (PCP), a Ca2+ channel blocker at NMDA receptors. We also tested D-amphetamine and dizocilpine to assess the specificity of the discrimination. As expected, dizocilpine produced PCP-like responding. After animals were trained to discriminate PCP from saline, they were inoculated with LP-BM5 and the PCP dose-response functions repeatedly determined. The potency of PCP in this procedure was unchanged 3 weeks after infection, but was increased approximately fivefold 6 and 9 weeks after infection. Amphetamine 9 weeks after inoculation did not produce PCP-like responding, showing that the results were not caused by a loss of specificity of the discrimination. The time course for changes in PCP potency is similar to those of other behavioral and neurochemical changes reported after LP-BM5 infection. The results are consistent with an action of LP-BM5 infection at glutamatergic synapses.","['English, J A', 'Bruce, K H', 'Paul, I A']","['English JA', 'Bruce KH', 'Paul IA']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson 39216-4505, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Adrenergic Agents)', '0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '6LR8C1B66Q (Dizocilpine Maleate)', 'CK833KGX7E (Amphetamine)', 'J1DOI7UV76 (Phencyclidine)']",IM,"['Adrenergic Agents/pharmacology', 'Amphetamine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Discrimination Learning', '*Discrimination, Psychological', 'Dizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*psychology', 'Phencyclidine/*pharmacology', 'Psychomotor Performance/drug effects', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014299998009613 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00961-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1999 Feb 12;367(1):1-5. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00961-3.,['MH-53228/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor action is mediated by a heterodimeric receptor consisting of two subunits, gp130 and the low-affinity leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). 2. We used chimeric receptors containing the intracellular domain of either the LIFR or gp130 to identify regions of the receptors required for induction of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene in IMR-32 and SN56 neuronal cells. 3. While chimeric receptors containing the intracellular domain of gp130 were able to induce transcription from both the m2 and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene promoters, chimeric receptors containing the intracellular domain of the LIFR were incapable of mediating induction of the m2 gene despite being able to induce VIP transcription. 4. Deletion and mutagenesis studies identified two tyrosines, Y905 and Y915, which were required for maximal induction of the m2 and VIP genes. 5. Because Y905 and Y915 are reported to be the only tyrosine residues in gp130 that bind Stat1, these results suggest that this transcription factor plays a key role in the induction of transcription of both the m2 and the VIP genes.","['Rosoff, M L', 'Nathanson, N M']","['Rosoff ML', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7750, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Contactins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M2)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Contactins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Neurons/chemistry/cytology/*physiology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M2', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/genetics', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*genetics']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006937413310 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Neurobiol. 1999 Apr;19(2):289-96. doi: 10.1023/a:1006937413310.,"['NS07332/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30410/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of the selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is still enigmatic. Recently we have shown that dopamine can induce apoptosis in postmitotic neuronal cells, as well as in other cellular systems, thus suggesting a role for this endogenous neurotransmitter and associated oxidative stress in the neuronal death process. 2. Dopamine has been shown to be capable of inducing DNA damage through its oxidative metabolites. p53 is a transcription factor that has a major role in determining cell fate in response to DNA damage. We therefore examined the possible correlation between dopamine-triggered apoptosis, DNA damage and levels of total phosphorylated p53 protein in cultured mouse cerebellar granule neurons. 3. Marked DNA damage and apoptotic nuclear condensation and fragmentation were detected within several hours of exposure to dopamine. An associated marked threefold increase in p53 phosphorylation was observed within this time window. Using a temperature-sensitive p53 activation system in leukemia LTR6 cells, were found that p53 inactivation dramatically attenuated dopamine toxicity. 4. We therefore conclude that DNA damage and p53 activation may have a role in mediating dopamine-induced apoptosis. Modulation of the p53 system may therefore have a protective role against the toxicity of this endogenous neurotransmitter and associated oxidative stress.","['Daily, D', 'Barzilai, A', 'Offen, D', 'Kamsler, A', 'Melamed, E', 'Ziv, I']","['Daily D', 'Barzilai A', 'Offen D', 'Kamsler A', 'Melamed E', 'Ziv I']","['Department of Neurobiochemistry, George S.

In this present study, we determined whether the apoptotic cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents could be inhibited by EAT/mcl-1, as has been found with Bcl-2. Cells transfected with EAT/mcl-1 showed higher resistance to cis-diammine dichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) and carboplatin compared with the parental line (10)1 and neomycin-resistance gene-transfected clone, (10)1/neo. There was, however, no difference in sensitivity to etoposide, N,N-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-N'-(3-hydroxypropyl) phosphordiamidic acid cyclic ester monohydrate, adriamycin or other chemotherapeutic agents tested. DNA fragmentation of the parental cells following treatment with CDDP and carboplatin was observed in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, cells transfected with EAT/mcl-1 did not show DNA fragmentation following treatment with the same concentration of these drugs. EAT/mcl-1 was capable of delaying the onset of p53-independent apoptosis, although it could not inhibit apoptosis completely. Since CDDP and carboplatin damage DNA and then activate c-abl and the JNK/SAPK pathway, EAT/mcl-1 may inhibit p53-independent apoptosis through a c-abl/JNK (SAPK)-dependent mechanism. EAT/mcl-1 has functional homology to Bcl-2 in that it can enhance cell viability under conditions which otherwise cause apoptosis and increase resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.","['Ando, T', 'Umezawa, A', 'Suzuki, A', 'Okita, H', 'Sano, M', 'Hiraoka, Y', 'Aiso, S', 'Saruta, T', 'Hata, J']","['Ando T', 'Umezawa A', 'Suzuki A', 'Okita H', 'Sano M', 'Hiraoka Y', 'Aiso S', 'Saruta T', 'Hata J']","['Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Mice', '*Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505099800519 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00530.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1998 Dec;89(12):1326-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00530.x.,,PMC5921739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine was initiated. As soon as the medication was reduced new skin changes developed. Two months after onset of the illness she had to be hospitalized because of fever, epigastric pain on pressure and deteriorating general condition. Physical examination provided no significant further information. LABORATORY RESULTS: The differential count demonstrated leucocytosis (15.5 Gpt/l) with a marked monocytosis (25%) as well as anaemia (haemoglobin concentration 5.2 mmol/l). C-reactive protein was elevated (120.20 mg/l). Thromboplastin time was 60%, D-dimer 1000 micrograms/l, thrombin-antithrombin-III complex 9.7 micrograms/l. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS: Sonography and computed tomography of the upper abdomen revealed splenomegaly, ascites, thrombosis of the portal, splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Bone marrow puncture showed marked increase in blasts (14%) and monocytes (10%). TREATMENT AND COURSE: The findings indicated chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with PG and the described venous thromboses. The cutaneous changes completely receded on administration of hydroxyurea (1.0 g/d). Other causes of the skin eruption were excluded. Phenprocoumon (INR between 2 and 3) was given in treatment of the thromboses. CONCLUSION: When PG is diagnosed, intensive search for an underlying cause must be undertaken, because of its frequent association with serious systemic disease. Only early specific treatment will improve the skin condition.","['Schiefke, I', 'Halm, U', 'Paasch, U', 'Ponisch, W', 'Berr, F', 'Mossner, J']","['Schiefke I', 'Halm U', 'Paasch U', 'Ponisch W', 'Berr F', 'Mossner J']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitat Leipzig.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'Q08SIO485D (Phenprocoumon)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Ascites/etiology', 'Azathioprine/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Mesenteric Veins', 'Phenprocoumon/therapeutic use', '*Portal Vein', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Splenic Vein', 'Splenomegaly', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Venous Thrombosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1024255 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1999 Feb 12;124(6):142-5. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1024255.,,,,Pyoderma gangraenosum und Pfortaderthrombose bei einer 33jahrigen Patientin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML is characterized by a block in myeloid differentiation. The transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBPalpha are responsible for normal myeloid differentiation from stem cells to monocytes or granulocytes. In particular, PU.1 induces expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and the development of monocytes, whereas C/EBPalpha increases the expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and leads to mature granulocytes. In AML, chromosomal aberrations result in oncoproteins such as AML1/ETO, PML/RARalpha, or activated Ras, which can deregulate genes important for normal myelopoiesis. Thus, AML1/ETO can bind to the transcription factor C/EBPalpha, inhibit C/EBPalpha-dependent transcription, and block granulocytic differentiation. However, AML1/ETO can also synergize with the transcription factor AML1 to enhance the activity of the M-CSF receptor promoter. On the other hand, the PML/RARalpha fusion protein causes transcriptional repression by recruiting the nuclear corepressor (N-CoR) histone deacetylase complex to the DNA, which results in decreased histone acetylation and a repressive chromatin organization. Here we describe methods to investigate whether and how signaling agonists induce myeloid differentiation and how oncoproteins might cause AML by modulating the activity of transcription factors that are pivotal for normal myeloid development.","['Behre, G', 'Zhang, P', 'Zhang, D E', 'Tenen, D G']","['Behre G', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang DE', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Medical School and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Methods,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biochemistry/methods', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukopoiesis/*genetics', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping/methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection/methods']",61,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1046-2023(98)90733-2 [pii]', '10.1006/meth.1998.0733 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods. 1999 Mar;17(3):231-7. doi: 10.1006/meth.1998.0733.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated the regulation of the expression of LIF by glucocorticosteroids (GC). Endothelial cells (EC) constitutively produce LIF and this production is enhanced by interleukin 1 (IL-1). GC were found to inhibit the basal production of LIF by EC and to suppress its IL-1-induced augmentation. Whether corticosteroids suppress LIF production by blocking transcription of LIF mRNA, or by blocking LIF synthesis at a post-transcriptional level was examined. Northern blot hybridization analysis demonstrated that GC act mainly by decreasing the LIF mRNA level. In the presence of translation inhibitors a superinduction of LIF mRNA was observed. Dexamethasone (DEX) at a concentration of 1 microM was responsible for a rapid increase in the degradation rate of LIF mRNA which resulted in reducing its level by more than 50% within 2 h, whereas the transcription rate of LIF gene was not significantly altered in these conditions. These results demonstrated that GC inhibit LIF mRNA expression mainly by increasing the turnover rate of the LIF mRNA. The early LIF mRNA destabilizing activity of GC was translation dependent as shown by experiments with protein translation inhibitors. The results indicate that corticosteroids are inhibitors of LIF expression and that this inhibition mainly occurs through post-transcriptional mechanisms.","['Grosset, C', 'Taupin, J L', 'Lemercier, C', 'Moreau, J F', 'Reiffers, J', 'Ripoche, J']","['Grosset C', 'Taupin JL', 'Lemercier C', 'Moreau JF', 'Reiffers J', 'Ripoche J']","['FR 60 Biologie des Greffes, Universite Victor Segalen, Universite de Bordeaux II, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)']",IM,"['Actins/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium/physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Umbilical Veins/physiology']",,1999/03/19 00:00,1999/03/19 00:01,['1999/03/19 00:00'],"['1999/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(98)90394-5 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1998.0394 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1999 Jan;11(1):29-36. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1998.0394.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one leukemia patients (SCT group), 51 lymphoma patients (ASCT group), and 85 CT patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline and after 1 year. RESULTS: The SCT group (median age, 36 years) had better functioning scores and less symptomatology at baseline compared with the ASCT (median age, 41 years) and CT (median age, 37 years) groups. Statistically significant differences of 10 or more points on the 0 to 100 scales were found for 10 of 15 scales and items (P< or =.01) between the SCT and ASCT groups. Global quality of life (79 v 58, P<.0001), role function (83 v 65, P = .001), sleep disturbances (6 v 28, P<.0001), and fatigue (25 v 44, P = .0001) deviated most. The differences were 10 or more points for seven of 15 scales and items comparing the SCT and CT groups, with sleep disturbances (6 v 35, P<.0001) and pain (11 v 29, P<.01) deviating most. Differences across groups were smaller after 1 year; cognitive function was the only scale with a statistically significant difference (ASCT 80 v CT 89; P = .002). Patterns of change in HRQOL scores were different between groups during follow-up. A great improvement was found in the ASCT group (P<.01 for emotional and role function, fatigue, appetite, and constipation), whereas no significant changes were observed for the SCT group. CONCLUSION: Prospective studies with extended follow-up periods are necessary to separate a slow recovery process from more permanently reduced HRQOL after transplantation and to examine the late side effects from previous treatment.","['Hjermstad, M J', 'Evensen, S A', 'Kvaloy, S O', 'Fayers, P M', 'Kaasa, S']","['Hjermstad MJ', 'Evensen SA', 'Kvaloy SO', 'Fayers PM', 'Kaasa S']","['Norwegian Cancer Society, Department of Oncology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo. mlhjerm@online.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Health Status', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.706 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;17(2):706-18. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.706.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a monitoring plan to obtain reliable estimates of the risk of secondary leukemia after epipodophyllotoxin treatment. METHODS: Twelve NCI-supported cooperative group clinical trials were identified that use epipodophyllotoxins at low (<1.5 g/m2 etoposide), moderate (1.5 to 2.99 g/m2 etoposide), or higher (> or =3.0 g/m2 etoposide) cumulative doses. Cases of secondary leukemia (including treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome) occurring on these trials have been reported to CTEP, as has duration of follow-up for all patients, thereby allowing calculation of cumulative 6-year incidence rates of secondary leukemia for each etoposide dose group. RESULTS: The calculated cumulative 6-year risks for development of secondary leukemia for the low, moderate, and higher cumulative dose groups were 3.3%, (95% upper confidence bound of 5.9%), 0.7% (95% upper confidence bound of 1.6%), and 2.2%, (95% upper confidence bound of 4.6%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Within the context of the epipodophyllotoxin cumulative dose range and schedules of administration encompassed by the monitoring plan regimens, and within the context of multiagent chemotherapy regimens that include alkylating agents, doxorubicin, and other agents, factors other than epipodophyllotoxin cumulative dose seem to be of primary importance in determining the risk of secondary leukemia. Data obtained by the CTEP secondary leukemia monitoring plan support the relative safety of using epipodophyllotoxins according to the therapeutic plans outlined in the monitored protocols.","['Smith, M A', 'Rubinstein, L', 'Anderson, J R', 'Arthur, D', 'Catalano, P J', 'Freidlin, B', 'Heyn, R', 'Khayat, A', 'Krailo, M', 'Land, V J', 'Miser, J', 'Shuster, J', 'Vena, D']","['Smith MA', 'Rubinstein L', 'Anderson JR', 'Arthur D', 'Catalano PJ', 'Freidlin B', 'Heyn R', 'Khayat A', 'Krailo M', 'Land VJ', 'Miser J', 'Shuster J', 'Vena D']","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. smithm@ctep.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Risk Factors']",,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.569 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;17(2):569-77. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.569.,"['CA-24507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existence of salvage treatment for patients with DLI after TCD allogeneic BMT prompted an evaluation of overall outcome after CD6+ -TCD allogeneic BMT for patients treated during the time when DLI has been available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes of 46 patients who underwent TCD allogeneic BMT for stable-phase CML and compared these outcomes with those of 40 patients who underwent non-TCD allogeneic BMT. All subjects were patients at one of two neighboring institutions during a period when DLI was available. All patients received marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors, underwent similar myeloablative regimens, and had similar pretreatment characteristics. RESULTS: After BMT, the TCD group had a lower incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute (15% v 37%, P = .026) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (18% v 42%, P = .024) than did the non-TCD group. The 1-year treatment-related mortality rates for the TCD group and the non-TCD group were 13% and 29%, respectively (P = .07). The estimated 3-year probability of relapse (cytogenetic or hematologic) was higher for patients in the TCD group than for patients in the non-TCD group (62% v 24%, P = .0003). Twenty-three patients (20 in the TCD group and three in the non-TCD group) received and were assessable for response to DLI. After DLI, 17 of 20 patients in the TCD group and two of three patients in the non-TCD group achieved complete remission. Donor lymphocyte infusion induced GVHD in nine of 23 patients. Thirty (65%) of 46 patients in the TCD group and 27 (69%) of 39 assessable patients in the non-TCD group remained alive without evidence of disease. The estimated 3-year overall survival rates were similar for the TCD group and the non-TCD group (72% v 68%, respectively; P = .38). At last follow-up, there was no difference in the overall prevalence of GVHD or the proportion of patients requiring immunosuppressive agents between groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the combination of T-cell depletion and post-BMT DLI is a viable treatment option for patients undergoing allogeneic BMT for CML and should be prospectively compared with traditional forms of GVHD prophylaxis.","['Sehn, L H', 'Alyea, E P', 'Weller, E', 'Canning, C', 'Lee, S', 'Ritz, J', 'Antin, J H', 'Soiffer, R J']","['Sehn LH', 'Alyea EP', 'Weller E', 'Canning C', 'Lee S', 'Ritz J', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.561 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;17(2):561-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.561.,['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoplasmacytoid (LPC) lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), and mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) also present with advanced-stage disease and are incurable with standard alkylator-based chemotherapy. A phase II trial was undertaken to determine the activity of F-AMP in patients newly diagnosed with these diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 1996, 78 patients (aged 18 to 75 years) received intravenous F-AMP (25 mg/m2/d for 5 days, every 4 weeks) until maximum response, plus two further cycles as consolidation. The primary end point was response rate; secondary end points included time to progression (TTP), duration of response, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Forty-four (62%) of 71 assessable patients had a response to F-AMP (LPC lymphoma, 63%; WM, 79%; MCL, 41%); the CR rate was 15%. At a median follow-up of 1.5 years, 19 of 44 responding patients have had progression of lymphoma; the median duration of response was 2.5 years. The median survival has not yet been reached. There was no significant difference in the duration of response or OS between patients with different histologies; TTP was shorter in patients with MCL (P = .015). Myelosuppression was relatively common, and the treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 5%, mostly associated with pancytopenia and infection. CONCLUSION: Single-agent fludarabine phosphate is active in previously untreated LPC lymphoma and WM, with only moderate activity in MCL. However, the CR rate is low, and the TRM is relatively high. Its role in combination chemotherapy remains to be demonstrated.","['Foran, J M', 'Rohatiner, A Z', 'Coiffier, B', 'Barbui, T', 'Johnson, S A', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Radford, J A', 'Norton, A J', 'Tollerfield, S M', 'Wilson, M P', 'Lister, T A']","['Foran JM', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Coiffier B', 'Barbui T', 'Johnson SA', 'Hiddemann W', 'Radford JA', 'Norton AJ', 'Tollerfield SM', 'Wilson MP', 'Lister TA']","[""Department of Histopathology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*drug therapy']",,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.546 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;17(2):546-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.546.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report treatment outcome for such patients treated with intensive therapy on consecutive Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1993, infants with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled onto CCG-107 (n = 99) and CCG-1883 (n = 135) protocols. Postconsolidation therapy was more intensive on CCG-1883. On both studies, prophylactic treatment of the CNS included both high-dose systemic chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy, in contrast to whole-brain radiotherapy, which was used in earlier studies. RESULTS: Most patients (>95%) achieved remission with induction therapy. The most frequent event was a marrow relapse (46 patients on CCG-107 and 66 patients on CCG- 1883). Four-year event-free survival was 33% (SE = 4.7%) on CCG-107 and 39% (SE = 4.2%) on CCG- 1883. Both studies represent an improvement compared with a 22% (SE = 5.1%) event-free survival for historical controls. Four-year cumulative probabilities of any marrow relapse or an isolated CNS relapse were, respectively, 49% (SE = 5%) and 9% (SE = 3%) on CCG-107 and 50% (SE = 5%) and 3% (SE = 2%) on CCG-1883, compared with 63% (SE = 6%) and 5% (SE = 3%) for the historical controls. Independent adverse prognostic factors were age less than 3 months, WBC count of more than 50,000/microL, CD10 negativity, slow response to induction therapy, and presence of the translocation t(4;11). CONCLUSION: Outcome for infants on CCG-107 and CCG- 1883 improved, compared with historical controls. Marrow relapse remains the primary mode of failure. Isolated CNS relapse rates are low, indicating that intrathecal chemotherapy combined with very-high-dose systemic therapy provides adequate protection of the CNS. The overall unsatisfactory outcome observed for the infant ALL population warrants the future use of novel alternative therapies.","['Reaman, G H', 'Sposto, R', 'Sensel, M G', 'Lange, B J', 'Feusner, J H', 'Heerema, N A', 'Leonard, M', 'Holmes, E J', 'Sather, H N', 'Pendergrass, T W', 'Johnstone, H S', ""O'Brien, R T"", 'Steinherz, P G', 'Zeltzer, P M', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Trigg, M E', 'Uckun, F M']","['Reaman GH', 'Sposto R', 'Sensel MG', 'Lange BJ', 'Feusner JH', 'Heerema NA', 'Leonard M', 'Holmes EJ', 'Sather HN', 'Pendergrass TW', 'Johnstone HS', ""O'Brien RT"", 'Steinherz PG', 'Zeltzer PM', 'Gaynon PS', 'Trigg ME', 'Uckun FM']","[""Children's National Medical Center and George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA. greaman@cnmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.445 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;17(2):445-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.445.,['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;17(2):438-40.

As clonality studies have clearly demonstrated that fibroblast proliferation in AMM, as well as in many other conditions such as advanced stages of Ph(+)-essential thrombocythemia, Ph(+)-granulocytic leukemia, and Ph(-)-polycythemia vera, is polyclonal indicating that myelofibrosis is secondary to the megakaryocytic granulocytic metaplasia in these various conditions, AMM is illogically labeled as IMF. As abnormal megakaryocytic granulocytic metaplasia is the essential feature preceding the early prefibrotic stage of AMM, the term essential megakaryocytic granulocytic metaplasia (EMGM) can readily be used to characterize this condition more appropriately at the biological level. Clinical, hematological and morphological characteristics, in particular megakaryocytopoiesis and bone marrow cellularity, reveal diagnostic features, which enable a clear-cut distinction between ET, PV and EMGM or classical IMF. The characteristic increase and clustering of enlarged megakaryocytes with mature cytoplasm and multilobulated nuclei and their tendency to cluster in a normal or only slightly increased cellular bone marrow represent the hallmark of ET. The characteristic increase and clustering of enlarged mature and pleiomorphic megakaryocytes with multilobulated nuclei and proliferation of erythropoiesis in a moderate to marked hypercellular bone marrow with hyperplasia of dilated sinuses are the specific diagnostic features of untreated PV. EMGM, including the early prefibrotic stages as well as the various myelofibrotic stages of classical IMF appear to be a distinct neoplastic dual proliferation of abnormal megakaryopoiesis and granulopoiesis. The histopathology of the bone marrow in prefibrotic EMGM and in classical IMF is dominated by atypical, enlarged and immature megakaryocytes with cloud-like immature nuclei, which are not seen in ET and PV at diagnosis and during follow-up. Myelofibrosis in ET, PV and EMGM is graded into: no reticulin fibrosis (MF0), early reticulin fibrosis (MF1), advanced reticulin sclerosis with minor or moderate collagen fibrosis (MF2) and advanced collagen fibrosis with osteosclerosis (MF3). Myelofibrosis is not a feature of ET at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Myelofibrosis may be present in a minority of PV-patients at diagnosis and usually becomes apparent during long-term follow-up in the majority of PV-patients. Myelofibrosis secondary to the abnormal megakaryocytic and granulocytic myeloproliferation constitutes a prominent feature in the majority of EMGM/IMF at time of diagnosis and usually progresses more or less rapidly during the natural history of the disease. Life expectancy is normal in ET, normal during the 1st ten years and compromised during the 2nd ten years follow-up in PV, but significantly shortened in the prefibrotic stage of EMGM as well as in the various myelosclerotic stages of classical IMF. First line treatment options in prospective randomized clinical trials of newly diagnosed MPD-patients are control of platelet function with low-dose aspirin versus reduction of platelet count with anagrelide, interferon or hydroxyurea in ET; control of platelet and erythrocyte counts by interferon alone versus bloodletting plus hydroxyurea on indication in PV; interferon versus no treatment in the early stages of EMGM; a wait and see strategy in the fibrotic stages of EMGM or classical IMF with favorable prognostic factors, and bone marrow transplantation in classical IMF with poor prognostic factors at presentation or during short-term follow-up.","['Michiels, J J', 'Kutti, J', 'Stark, P', 'Bazzan, M', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Marchioli, R', 'Griesshammer, M', 'van Genderen, P J', 'Briere, J', 'Kiladjian, J J', 'Barbui, T', 'Finazzi, G', 'Berlin, N I', 'Pearson, T C', 'Green, A C', 'Fruchtmann, S M', 'Silver, R T', 'Hansmann, E', 'Wehmeier, A', 'Lengfelder, E', 'Landolfi, R', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Hasselbalch, H', 'Cervantes, F', 'Thiele, J']","['Michiels JJ', 'Kutti J', 'Stark P', 'Bazzan M', 'Gugliotta L', 'Marchioli R', 'Griesshammer M', 'van Genderen PJ', 'Briere J', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Barbui T', 'Finazzi G', 'Berlin NI', 'Pearson TC', 'Green AC', 'Fruchtmann SM', 'Silver RT', 'Hansmann E', 'Wehmeier A', 'Lengfelder E', 'Landolfi R', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Hasselbalch H', 'Cervantes F', 'Thiele J', 'et al.']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. postbus@goodheartcenter.demon.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis/etiology/therapy']",70,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0300297798001430 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-2977(98)00143-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Neth J Med. 1999 Feb;54(2):46-62. doi: 10.1016/s0300-2977(98)00143-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disorder results from a clonal expansion of transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells and includes myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and lymphoid lineages. At the molecular level, CML is characterized by the bcr-abl fusion gene, which results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), creating the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Chronic myelogenous leukemia was the first human disease for which a specific karyotype abnormality was demonstrated and could be linked to pathogenetic events of leukemogenesis. The outlook for patients with CML has changed dramatically over the last decade. The median survival time of patients has doubled to 5 to 7 years, with up to 50% of patients alive at 5 years. This development is due to refinements in allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and growing expertise in the use of interferon-alfa (Intron A, Roferon-A), a biological agent that has been shown to suppress the leukemic clone and to prolong survival in patients with CML. This review provides a concise update of the biology of CML, as well as current therapeutic options and management strategies.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Faderl S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",75,1999/03/18 00:00,1999/03/18 00:01,['1999/03/18 00:00'],"['1999/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['172959 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 1999 Feb;13(2):169-80; discussion 181, 184.",,,,,,,,172959 [pii],,,,,,,,,

We have also raised antibodies to HJ1, and used these antibodies in conjunction with in situ hybridization to examine the expression of these ligands in normal and cancerous cervical tissue. We find that, as reported previously for Notch, the ligands are up-regulated in certain neoplastic tissues.

The binding activity of this factor was decreased by TPA treatment in THP-1 cells, but not in HeLa cells. This binding activity was also detectable in nuclear extracts of bovine brains. Thus, we isolated the DHS-22 binding factor from bovine brain nuclear extracts and finally identified it as NF90 on the basis of molecular mass analysis of Lys-C-digested fragments and amino acid sequences of the two peptides of the trypsin-digested binding protein. The DHS-22 binding protein(s) in THP-1 cells is (are) further confirmed by reactivity to an antibody against NF90, and we have demonstrated that the GST fusion protein of NF90 interacts with DHS-22 by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-three consecutive patients with ALL receiving a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical allogeneic BMT between 1 August 1983 and 30 September 1995 were conditioned with the same protocol consisting of cyclophosphamide and fractionated TBI. The planned total dose of TBI was 12 Gy (2 Gy, twice a day for 3 days). Along the 12-year period, variations in delivering TBI schedule occurred with regard to used radiation source, instantaneous dose rate, technical setting, and actual total dose received by the patient. We tested these different TBI variables as well as factors related to patient, state of disease, and transplant-induced disease to investigate their influence on transplant-related mortality, leukemia relapse, and survival. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 7 years (range 3-15 years) the probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) for the 93 patients were 60% and 41%, respectively. At univariate analysis, chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHd) (p = 0.0005), age (p = 0.01), and state of disease (p = 0.03) were factors affecting LFS whereas chronic GvHd (p = 0.0005), acute GvHd (p = 0.03), age (p = 0.0001), and GvHd prophylaxis (p = 0.01) were factors affecting overall survival. The occurrence of chronic GvHd was correlated with actually delivered TBI dose (p = 0.04). Combined stratification of prognostic factors showed that patients who received the planned total dose of TBI (12 Gy) and were affected by chronic GvHd had higher probabilities of LFS (p = 0.01) and OS (p = n.s.) than patients receiving less than 12 Gy and/or without occurrence of chronic GvHd. Moreover, TBI dose had a significant impact on LFS in patients transplanted in first remission (p = 0.05). At multivariate analysis, TBI dose was an independent factor affecting overall survival (p = 0.05) as well as chronic GvHd (p = 0.001) and age (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis showed that different variables involved in TBI delivery may influence the occurrence of cGvHd and affect prognosis of patients with ALL receiving allogeneic BMT. The total dose of 12 Gy, administered in six fractions over 3 days, appears to be an effective and low toxic regimen for ALL patients transplanted in first remission.","['Corvo, R', 'Paoli, G', 'Barra, S', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Franzone, P', 'Frassoni, F', 'Scarpati, D', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Vitale, V']","['Corvo R', 'Paoli G', 'Barra S', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Van Lint MT', 'Franzone P', 'Frassoni F', 'Scarpati D', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Vitale V']","['Servizio di Oncologia Radioterapica, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro di Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Pneumonitis/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00441-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00441-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Feb 1;43(3):497-503. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00441-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma/prolymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large cell, and follicle center neoplasms were the most common B-cell subtypes. Large granular lymphocyte leukemia was the most common T-cell neoplasm. Nodular sclerosis was the most common Hodgkin disease variant. The relative frequencies in a US community hospital setting are similar to those reported in other studies. Differences are attributable to patient selection criteria, study group geographic location and racial composition, and/or referral patterns.

Patients with connective tissue disease sometimes develop hematological malignancies. Increased risk of lymphoma in Sjogren's syndrome has been known. The use of alkylating agents as immunosuppressive therapy is also associated with the risk of secondary or therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

H-, A- and B-active oligosaccharides were isolated from the globoside fractions from human erythrocytes by ozonolysis. One of the H-active oligosaccharide with short carbohydrate chain is a pentasaccharide: Fuc(alpha 1-->2)Gal(beta 1-->4)GlcNAc(beta 1-->3)Gal(beta 1-->4)Glc, and the other with long carbohydrate chain is a heptasaccharide: Fuc(alpha 1-->2)Gal(beta 1-->4)GlcNAc(beta 1-->3)Gal(beta 1-->4)GlcNAc(beta 1-->3)Gal(beta 1-->4)Glc. Hexa- or octasaccharides with blood group A- or B-activity have an additional alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyl residue or alpha-galactosyl residue, which joints with alpha 1-->3 linkage to subterminal beta-galactose of the both of H-active oligosaccharides, respectively. 2. A blood group A-gene specified alpha-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase (A-enzyme) catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine from the UDP-sugar to the subterminal beta-galactosyl residue of blood group H-active carbohydrate chain, and a blood group B-gene specified alpha-galactosyltransferase (B-enzyme) catalyzes the transfer of galactose from the UDP-sugar to the subterminal beta-galactosyl residue of blood group H-active carbohydrate chain, respectively. Either the A- or B-enzyme can not transfer the substrate sugar to the carbohydrate chain lacking alpha-fucosyl residue of H-determinant, and it is the reason why the synthesis of blood group A- or B-antigenic structure in inhibited in the tissues of Bombay phenotype and in the secretory glands of the nonsecretor. 3. Specific antibody either to the A- or B-enzyme can be introduced in the serum of the rabbit which was immunized with the A- or B-enzyme preparation, respectively. And immunological cross reaction is also present between the A- and B-enzyme, but the immunologically cross reactive material can not be found in the blood group O individual. The absence of immunologically cross reactive material in the blood group O individual is supported by a fact that the cross reactive antibody similar to the antibody in rabbit serum was present in the serum of the chronic myeloid leukemia patient, who was belonged to blood group B and treated with blood group incompatible bone marrow transplantation from blood group O donor, because it is acceptable to speculate that the grafted lymphocytes react to the B-enzyme in the recipient and produce the anti-enzyme antibody. 4. The immunological profiles described above are compatible with the cDNA structures of human blood group ABO alleles presented by Yamamoto F. et al. Their gene model is that the cDNAs of blood group ABO alleles are highly homologous, but the cDNA of common O allele is non-functional due to a single nucleotide deletion close to the 5'end of the coding sequence, which causes a frame shift of the codon, and results in truncated peptide. 5. Transcription of the human blood group ABO gene can be enhanced by a CBF/NF-Y which binds the minisatellite on the 5'-upstream sequence of the gene.","['Takizawa, H']",['Takizawa H'],"['Department of Legal Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Lecture', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Hoigaku Zasshi,Nihon hoigaku zasshi = The Japanese journal of legal medicine,0413715,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', 'EC 2.4.- (Glycosyltransferases)']",IM,"['*ABO Blood-Group System/chemistry/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cross Reactions', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycosyltransferases/immunology', 'Humans', 'Oligosaccharides/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Rabbits', 'Transcription, Genetic']",49,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Hoigaku Zasshi. 1998 Oct;52(5):265-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lentiviral vector, but not the MLV vector, expressed GFP in nondivided CD34(+) cells (45.5% GFP+) and in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in G0 (12.4% GFP+), 48 hr after transduction. However, GFP could also be detected short-term in CD34(+) cells transduced with a lentiviral vector that contained a mutated integrase gene. The level of stable transduction from integrated vector was determined after extended long-term bone marrow culture. Both MLV vectors and lentiviral vectors efficiently transduced cytokine-stimulated CD34(+) cells. The MLV vector did not transduce more primitive, quiescent CD34(+)CD38(-) cells (n = 8). In contrast, stable transduction of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells by the lentiviral vector was seen for over 15 weeks of extended long-term culture (9.2 +/- 5.2%, n = 7). GFP expression in clones from single CD34(+)CD38(-) cells confirmed efficient, stable lentiviral transduction in 29% of early and late-proliferating cells. In the absence of growth factors during transduction, only the lentiviral vector was able to transduce CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) cells (13.5 +/- 2.5%, n = 11 and 12.2 +/- 9.7%, n = 4, respectively).

The challenge now is to interpret such massive data sets. The first step is to extract the fundamental patterns of gene expression inherent in the data. This paper describes the application of self-organizing maps, a type of mathematical cluster analysis that is particularly well suited for recognizing and classifying features in complex, multidimensional data. The method has been implemented in a publicly available computer package, GENECLUSTER, that performs the analytical calculations and provides easy data visualization. To illustrate the value of such analysis, the approach is applied to hematopoietic differentiation in four well studied models (HL-60, U937, Jurkat, and NB4 cells). Expression patterns of some 6,000 human genes were assayed, and an online database was created. GENECLUSTER was used to organize the genes into biologically relevant clusters that suggest novel hypotheses about hematopoietic differentiation-for example, highlighting certain genes and pathways involved in ""differentiation therapy"" used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Tamayo, P', 'Slonim, D', 'Mesirov, J', 'Zhu, Q', 'Kitareewan, S', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Lander, E S', 'Golub, T R']","['Tamayo P', 'Slonim D', 'Mesirov J', 'Zhu Q', 'Kitareewan S', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Lander ES', 'Golub TR']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Software']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.6.2907 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 16;96(6):2907-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.6.2907.,,PMC15868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential downstream effectors of the LIF signal in ES cells include kinases of the Src, Jak, and mitogen-activated protein families and the signal transducer and transcriptional activator STAT3. Activation of nuclear STAT3 and the ability of ES cells to grow as undifferentiated clones were monitored during LIF withdrawal. A correlation was found between levels of STAT3 activity and maintenance of an undifferentiated phenotype at clonal density. In contrast, variation in STAT3 activity did not affect cell proliferation. The requirement for STAT3 was analyzed by targeted mutagenesis in ES cell lines exhibiting different degrees of LIF dependency. An insertional mutation was devised that abrogated Stat3 gene expression but could be reversed by Cre recombination-mediated excision. ES cells heterozygous for the Stat3 mutation could be isolated only from E14 cells, the line least dependent on LIF for self-renewal. Targeted clones isolated from other ES cell lines were invariably trisomic for chromosome 11, which carries the Stat3 locus, and retained normal levels of activated STAT3. Cre-regulated reduction of Stat3 gene copy number in targeted, euploid E14 clones resulted in dose-dependent losses of STAT3 activity and the efficiency of self-renewal without commensurate changes in cell cycle progression. These results demonstrate an essential role for a critical amount of STAT3 in the maintenance of an undifferentiated ES cell phenotype.","['Raz, R', 'Lee, C K', 'Cannizzaro, L A', ""d'Eustachio, P"", 'Levy, D E']","['Raz R', 'Lee CK', 'Cannizzaro LA', ""d'Eustachio P"", 'Levy DE']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Mice', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.6.2846 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 16;96(6):2846-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.6.2846.,"['R01 AI028900/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI28900/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC15857,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent patho-histological observations of remedial tests using rats found that the IS-741 administered group showed a low degree of tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). We therefore examined cell adhesion, which is the first step in tissue infiltration by activated neutrophils, and investigated the effect of IS-741 on cell adhesion between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human promyelo-leukemia cell line (HL-60) cells during lipopolysaccharide stimulation in vitro. IS-741 significantly inhibited the adhesion of HL-60 cells to HUVEC. Further investigation of IS-741 on individual cells revealed that IS-741 mainly affected HL-60 cells. Investigation of the inhibitory effect of IS-741 at the molecular level (targeting adhesion molecules) also revealed that IS-741 had no effect on the appearance of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on HUVEC, which supports the theory that IS-741 is mainly effective on HL-60 cells, even at the molecular level. However, the inhibition of adhesion was noticed in experiments in which an anti-ICAM-1 or anti-VCAM-1 antibody was added to the adhesion test system. Therefore, IS-741 is likely to affect adhesion molecules which belong to the beta1 or beta2 integrin family.","['Shikama, H', 'Yotsuya, S', 'Satake, S', 'Sugi, H', 'Kato, M']","['Shikama H', 'Yotsuya S', 'Satake S', 'Sugi H', 'Kato M']","['Central Research Institute, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Pyridines)', '03TE67E8IR (IS 741)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.22.127 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1999 Feb;22(2):127-31. doi: 10.1248/bpb.22.127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study used dissociated rat retinal ganglion cells purified by immunopanning to identify peripheral nervous system-derived factors that promote axonal outgrowth. Of the multiple growth factors investigated, only ciliary neurotrophic factor and the related cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, had striking neuritogenic activity, with half-maximal effects at 1-2 ng/ml. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulated retinal ganglion cell survival nearly as well as ciliary neurotrophic factor, but had only minor effects on outgrowth. Thus, the neuritogenic effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor are not a simple consequence of increased survival. Ciliary neurotrophic factor-stimulated outgrowth was correlated with increased expression of the growth-associated membrane phosphoprotein, GAP-43, a hallmark of optic nerve regeneration in vivo. A high molecular weight fraction from media conditioned by rat optic or sciatic nerve mimicked the effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor in inducing axonal outgrowth. Ciliary neurotrophic factor was detected in the conditioned media on western blots, and the biological activity of the conditioned media was neutralized with an anti-ciliary neurotrophic factor antibody. These results indicate that ciliary neurotrophic factor has specific effects on axon outgrowth in retinal ganglion cells that are dissociable from its effects on cell survival, and that ciliary neurotrophic factor accounts for most of the axon-promoting activity for retinal ganglion cells present in either the sciatic or optic nerve.","['Jo, S A', 'Wang, E', 'Benowitz, L I']","['Jo SA', 'Wang E', 'Benowitz LI']","[""Laboratory for Neuroscience Research in Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital, Boston, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'GAP-43 Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Optic Nerve/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Sciatic Nerve/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452298005466 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00546-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1999 Mar;89(2):579-91. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00546-6.,['R01 EY 05690/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have constructed a bicistronic retroviral vector, Ha-TM1-IRES-neo, that carries the mutant (Gly-533) TOP1 cDNA (TM1) and a neomycin-resistance gene to examine the effect of mutant DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) expression on CPT resistance of cells. HeLa S3 cells were transduced with Ha-TM1-IRES-neo, and the transduced cells were selected with G418. Two independently isolated populations of the G418-resistant cells and 2 clones showed 1.7- to 1.8-fold higher resistance to CPT than the control cells. Integration and expression of the exogenous TOP1 were confirmed by genomic and RT-PCR analyses. The topo I enzyme (mixture of mutant and wild-type) expressed in the transduced cells showed 3-fold resistance to CPT in cleavable-complex-formation assay and DNA-relaxation assay.

Many of these drugs are classified as weak bases whose binding to intracellular targets is pH-dependent. Slight alterations in intracellular pH gradients have been shown to affect accumulation, endocytosis and secretion of drugs. In this study, we developed a new method based on confocal spectral imaging analysis to determine intracellular pH gradients in sensitive and MDR tumor cells. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetramethylrhodamine conjugated to dextran (FRD) and SNAFL-calcein-AM were used to determine pH in acidic compartments. Carboxy-SNARF1-AM was used to examine cytosolic pH. We observed that sensitive (HL60, K562, CEM and MCF7) cells exhibit lower acidity of the subcellular organelles than that corresponding to drug-resistant derivatives. Moreover, results obtained with carboxy-SNARF1-AM show that resistant cells display a more alkaline cytosolic pH. This results in a considerably larger pH gradient between the vesicular compartments and the cytosol of resistant cells than of sensitive cells. The lower pH gradient observed in sensitive cells may be related to a disruption in the organization of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In drug-resistant cells, the organization of TGN appears compact. In addition, confocal microscopic analysis of cells labelled with FRD and SNAFL-calcein showed that sensitive cells contain a lower number of acidified vesicles. This suggest a diminished capacity of these cells to remove protonated drugs from the cytoplasm to secretory compartments followed by their secretion through the activity of the secretory and recycling pathways.","['Belhoussine, R', 'Morjani, H', 'Sharonov, S', 'Ploton, D', 'Manfait, M']","['Belhoussine R', 'Morjani H', 'Sharonov S', 'Ploton D', 'Manfait M']","['Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, UFR de Pharmacie, IFR53, Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Biomoleculaire, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Calibration', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorometry/methods', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microspectrophotometry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/17 03:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/17 03:04'],"['1999/03/17 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/17 03:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<81::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<81::aid-ijc15>3.0.co;2-p [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Mar 31;81(1):81-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<81::aid-ijc15>3.0.co;2-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of Dex was completely reversed by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU38486. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, we examined effects of Dex on the binding avidity of beta2 integrin on the neutrophil surface and how these might in turn affect neutrophil-to-tumor cell binding. Dex was found to inhibit these neutrophil properties, and RU38486 completely suppressed both forms of Dex inhibition. Taken together, our findings suggest that glucocorticoid hormone inhibition of neutrophil-mediated tumor cell cytostasis is at least partially due to a lowering of the ligand binding avidity of beta2 integrin on the neutrophil surface.","['Yazawa, H', 'Kato, T', 'Nakada, T', 'Sendo, F']","['Yazawa H', 'Kato T', 'Nakada T', 'Sendo F']","['Department of Immunology and Parasitology, Yamagata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1999/03/17 03:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/17 03:04'],"['1999/03/17 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/17 03:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<74::AID-IJC14>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<74::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-s [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Mar 31;81(1):74-80. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<74::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant MTG8 protein was first found to be associated with two serine/threonine protein kinases in cell extracts from both HEL cells and a leukemic cell line carrying t(8;21). A cytoplasmic protein kinase of 61 kDa (MTG8N-kinase) phosphorylated the amino-terminal of MTG8, and another of 52 kDa (MTG8C-kinase) phosphorylated the carboxyl-terminal domain. In addition, we demonstrated that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) specifically binds to the amino-terminal domain of MTG8 in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results shed new light on post-translational regulation of MTG8, perturbation of which, in AML1-MTG8 protein, probably contributes to leukemogenesis.","['Komori, A', 'Sueoka, E', 'Fujiki, H', 'Ishii, M', 'Kozu, T']","['Komori A', 'Sueoka E', 'Fujiki H', 'Ishii M', 'Kozu T']",['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505099800283 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1999.tb00666.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1999 Jan;90(1):60-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1999.tb00666.x.,,PMC5925983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, while methotrexate (MTX) influx in MTXrA cells at pH 6.0 was 15-fold higher than at pH 7.5, in L1210 cells it was decreased by half. Influx of MTX, folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in MTXrA cells was increased at pH < 7.0, but their pH optima and profile differed substantially. Influx of MTX and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate at pH 6.0 showed saturability, with a Kt of 2.65 and 0.56 microM, and a Vmax of 0.45 and 0.083 nmol/g dry wt/min, respectively. MTX influx mediated by the low pH transporter was insensitive to the anionic composition of the transport buffer and affected minimally (approximately 20%) by Na+ substitution. The anion transport inhibitors sulfobromophthalein, diisothiocyanatostilbene disulfonic acid, and acetamidoisothiocyanatostilbene disulfonic acid were not effective inhibitors of the low pH route. MTX transport at low pH did not increase in MTXrA-R16 cells, an MTXrA derivative with 10-fold overexpression of the reduced folate carrier (RFC) due to transfection with RFC1 cDNA. Inhibition of reduced folate carrier activity with acetamidoisothiocyanatostilbene disulfonic acid resulted in identical MTX influx in L1210, MTXrA, and MTXrA-R16 cells at pH 5.5. Finally, low pH-mediated MTX influx was reduced by energy inhibitors and partially inhibited by ionophores (nigericin > monensin >> valinomycin).

The antigen recognized by mAb R21 was found on the surface of all T-cell, fibroblastoid, and epithelial cells lines, and a part of B-cell and myelomonocytoid cell lines. MAb R21 reacted with an approximately 17-kDa protein from ILT8M2 and MOLT-4 cell lysates in both nonreducing and reducing conditions by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation experiments using surface-labeled cells revealed that a 17-kDa protein is present on the surface of both ILT8M2 and MOLT-4 cells. Since the enhancing activity by mAb R21 of syncytium formation was observed only in the presence of a factor contained in fetal calf serum (FCS) which seems to bind to mAb R21, we purified this serum factor from FCS using a mAb R21-coupled Sepharose 4B column. The purified protein, designated as R21 protein, was revealed to be O-glycosylated but not N-glycosylated protein of approximately 17 kDa. The partial amino acid sequence of this protein indicates that R21 protein is a novel bovine serum protein which has approximately 90% amino acid homology with bovine platelet factor 4, a member of CXC chemokine family. These results indicate that the R21 protein on the surface of cells and/or in FCS may play an important role in the process of HTLV-I-induced syncytium formation by as yet unknown mechanism.","['Okuma, K', 'Nakamura, M', 'Nakano, S', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Niho, Y']","['Okuma K', 'Nakamura M', 'Nakano S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Proteins/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Factor 4/genetics', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s007050050481 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1999;144(1):1-18. doi: 10.1007/s007050050481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human bone marrow stromal cells regulate marrow hematopoiesis by secreting cytokines. By using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrate that human bone marrow stromal cells constitutively express LIF, IL-6 and IL-8 transcripts. By using specific ELISAs, we found that their spontaneous productions of LIF, IL-6 and IL-8 are elevated in response to serum and after stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 reduces their serum- and cytokine-induced LIF secretion. By contrast, IL-4 stimulates their serum- and IL-1alpha-induced IL-6 synthesis. IL-4 has no effect on the serum-induced IL-8 synthesis by marrow stromal cells, but stimulates their cytokine-induced IL-8 production. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has no effect on the serum- and cytokine-induced LIF, IL-6 and IL-8 synthesis by bone marrow stromal cells. RT-PCR experiments reveal the presence of IL-4 receptor alpha-chain mRNA and IL-10 receptor mRNA in cultured bone marrow stromal cells. The differential regulation by IL-4 of two related cytokines, such as LIF and IL-6, and the enhanced effect of this 'anti-inflammatory' cytokine on IL-6 and IL-8 synthesis highlight the tightly controlled regulation and the complexity of the cytokine production within the human bone marrow.","['Denizot, Y', 'Besse, A', 'Raher, S', 'Nachat, R', 'Trimoreau, F', 'Praloran, V', 'Godard, A']","['Denizot Y', 'Besse A', 'Raher S', 'Nachat R', 'Trimoreau F', 'Praloran V', 'Godard A']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Experimentale, Faculte de Medecine, 2 rue Dr. Marcland, 87025, Limoges, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(98)00177-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(98)00177-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Feb 4;1449(1):83-92. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(98)00177-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RING finger domain of Vmw110 (but not the C-terminal region) was essential for its localization at centromeres, thus distinguishing the Vmw110 sequences required for centromere association from those required for its localization at other discrete nuclear structures known as ND10, promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies or PODs. We have shown recently that Vmw110 can induce the proteasome-dependent loss of several cellular proteins, including a number of probable SUMO-1-conjugated isoforms of PML, and this results in the disruption of ND10. In this study, we found some striking similarities between the interactions of Vmw110 with ND10 and centromeres. Specifically, centromeric protein CENP-C was lost from centromeres during virus infection in a Vmw110- and proteasome-dependent manner, causing substantial ultrastructural changes in the kinetochore. In consequence, dividing cells either became stalled in mitosis or underwent an unusual cytokinesis resulting in daughter cells with many micronuclei. These results emphasize the importance of CENP-C for mitotic progression and suggest that Vmw110 may be interfering with biochemical mechanisms which are relevant to both centromeres and ND10.","['Everett, R D', 'Earnshaw, W C', 'Findlay, J', 'Lomonte, P']","['Everett RD', 'Earnshaw WC', 'Findlay J', 'Lomonte P']","['MRC Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK. r.everett@vi.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (centromere protein C)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Centromere/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Interphase', 'Kinetochores/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mitosis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,1999/03/17 00:00,1999/03/17 00:01,['1999/03/17 00:00'],"['1999/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/18.6.1526 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1999 Mar 15;18(6):1526-38. doi: 10.1093/emboj/18.6.1526.,['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],PMC1171241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 concentrations were higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. The increase in pressure due to a cold pressor test caused a further increase in blood bcl-2 concentrations, in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Treatment of hypertensive patients with hypotensive drugs caused a reduction in bcl-2 concentrations, which was more marked after administration of lisinopril than of nifedipine. The results suggest that concentrations of bcl-2 are increased in patients with hypertension, which could be an important factor in cell proliferation underlying posthypertensive vascular remodeling. Moreover, lisinopril and nifedipine appear to be capable of reducing bcl-2 concentrations, with potentially beneficial effects on vascular modifications in patients with hypertension.","['Buemi, M', 'Allegra, A', 'Corica, F', 'Aloisi, C', 'Ruello, A', 'Giacobbe, M S', 'Di Pasquale, G', 'Senatore, M', 'Frisina, N']","['Buemi M', 'Allegra A', 'Corica F', 'Aloisi C', 'Ruello A', 'Giacobbe MS', 'Di Pasquale G', 'Senatore M', 'Frisina N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Am J Hypertens,American journal of hypertension,8803676,"['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', 'E7199S1YWR (Lisinopril)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arteries/drug effects/pathology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lisinopril/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nifedipine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*blood/drug effects', 'Vasodilator Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,1999/03/13 00:00,1999/03/13 00:01,['1999/03/13 00:00'],"['1999/03/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0895-7061(98)00217-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0895-7061(98)00217-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hypertens. 1999 Jan;12(1 Pt 1):73-5. doi: 10.1016/s0895-7061(98)00217-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of ascorbic acid loading on apoptosis induced by serum- and glucose-free culture and by oxidative stress induced by H2O2. Uptake accumulation studies indicated that incubation of HL-60 cells with DHA resulted in the accumulation of intracellular ascorbic acid which decreased with time when cells were incubated in DHA-free medium. Exposure of HL-60 cells to increasing concentrations of H2O2 resulted in dose-dependent intracellular accumulation of peroxides, as determined by the use of the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA), which was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular ascorbic acid and an increase in apoptosis. A dramatic decrease in intracellular ascorbic acid was noted when preloaded HL-60 cells were exposed to 150 microM H2O2 (the concentration dropped from 5.2 +/- 0.6 mM to 3.6 +/- 0.1 mM in cells preincubated with 150 microM DHA). A dose-dependent protective effect of DHA was observed. Ascorbic acid loading also provided strong protection from apoptosis associated with serum- and glucose-free culture. Flow cytometry studies showed that exposure of HL-60 cells to 150 microM H2O2 resulted in decreased Bcl-2 expression that was associated with enhanced apoptosis (up to 33.6 +/- 2.6%). No significant variation of Bcl-2 expression was measured following exposure of HL-60 cells, loaded with ascorbic acid, to 150 microM H2O2 and only a slight increase (up to 10.1 +/- 3.1%) in apoptosis. These findings indicate that ascorbic acid can inhibit apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in HL-60 cells.","['Witenberg, B', 'Kalir, H H', 'Raviv, Z', 'Kletter, Y', 'Kravtsov, V', 'Fabian, I']","['Witenberg B', 'Kalir HH', 'Raviv Z', 'Kletter Y', 'Kravtsov V', 'Fabian I']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Peroxides)', '2044-85-1 (diacetyldichlorofluorescein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'Y2Z3ZTP9UM (Dehydroascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dehydroascorbic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Peroxides/metabolism']",,1999/03/13 00:00,1999/03/13 00:01,['1999/03/13 00:00'],"['1999/03/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00351-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00351-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Apr 1;57(7):823-32. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00351-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because stress affects numerous physiological systems, the role of the immune system in mediating such effects is unclear. In the current study, we assessed the degree to which stress-induced alterations in natural killer (NK) cell activity underlie increased susceptibility to tumor development in F344 rats. Two stress paradigms were used: forced swim and abdominal surgery. Host resistance to tumor development was studied using 3 tumor models syngeneic to inbred F344 rats: CRNK-16 leukemia and the MADB106 mammary adenocarcinoma, both sensitive to NK activity, and the NK-insensitive C4047 colon cancer. Swim stress increased CRNK-16-associated mortality and metastatic development of MADB106 but not metastasis of C4047 cells. In both stress paradigms, stress suppressed NK activity (NKA) for a duration that paralleled its metastasis-enhancing effects on the MADB106 tumor. In vivo depletion of large granular lymphocyte/NK cells abolished the metastasis-enhancing effects of swim stress but not of surgical stress. Our findings indicate that stress-induced suppression of NKA is sufficient to cause enhanced tumor development. Under certain stressful conditions, suppression of NKA is the primary mediator of the tumor-enhancing effects of stress, while under other conditions, additional factors play a significant role. Clinical circumstances in which surgical stress may induce enhanced metastatic growth are discussed.","['Ben-Eliyahu, S', 'Page, G G', 'Yirmiya, R', 'Shakhar, G']","['Ben-Eliyahu S', 'Page GG', 'Yirmiya R', 'Shakhar G']","['Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv University, Israel. shamgar@ccsg.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Immunocompetence', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Laparotomy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Stress, Physiological/*complications/immunology', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative/*adverse effects', 'Swimming', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/13 03:10,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/13 03:10'],"['1999/03/13 03:10 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/13 03:10 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990315)80:6<880::AID-IJC14>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990315)80:6<880::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Mar 15;80(6):880-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990315)80:6<880::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-y.,"['CA73056-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NR03915/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gadd45, in particular, has been linked to a p53-dependent inducible network required for regulated transition from G1 to S phase of cell cycle following genotoxic insult and growth arrest treatments and has seemingly a pivotal role in DNA repair. DESIGN AND METHODS: Here we show that competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an adequate method to quantitate gadd45 expression levels in hematopoietic progenitor cell line 32D, whose constitutive gene expression is very low. RESULTS: The sensitivity and reproducibility of our strategy support its usefulness for clinical purposes, to assess the DNA repair capacity of highly purified early myeloid progenitors, whose failure may be responsible for either short-term chemotherapy side effects (bone marrow hypoplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia) or long-term consequences of antiblastic drugs (leukemia and myelodysplasia).","['Santucci, M A', 'Ripalti, A', 'di Paola, M C', 'Mianulli, A M', 'Iacurti, E', 'Campanini, F', 'Gamberi, B', 'Tura, S']","['Santucci MA', 'Ripalti A', 'di Paola MC', 'Mianulli AM', 'Iacurti E', 'Campanini F', 'Gamberi B', 'Tura S']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Institute of Hematology and Clinical Oncology L. e A.

This element, termed the R region stem-loop (RSL), has a small effect on transcriptional initiation and no effect on RNA polymerase processivity. Its major effect is on posttranscriptional processing of LTR-driven transcripts. Here we tested whether the RSL affected the production of RNAs from a full-length SL3 genome. Mutation of the RSL in the 5' LTR of SL3 reduced the cytoplasmic levels of full-length viral transcripts but not those of spliced, env mRNA transcripts. Thus, the RSL specifically affected the cytoplasmic levels of the unspliced viral RNA. To test further whether the effect was specific for unspliced transcripts, a system was devised in which the expression of a reporter gene under the control of the viral LTR was tested in the presence or absence of an intron. Mutation of the RSL resulted in only about a twofold decline in the level of reporter gene expression when the transcripts contained an intron. However, when the intron was removed, mutation of the RSL reduced expression of the reporter gene about 10- to 60-fold in various cell lines. The secondary structure of the RSL was essential for its activity on the intronless transcript. Thus, the RSL appears to be important for the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced viral RNA and unspliced RNA from chimeric transcription units under the control of the viral LTR.","['Trubetskoy, A M', 'Okenquist, S A', 'Lenz, J']","['Trubetskoy AM', 'Okenquist SA', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics']",,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.4.3477-3483.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Apr;73(4):3477-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.4.3477-3483.1999.,"['R01 CA044822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM7288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC104116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Either multiple copies of the 21-bp sequence or a combination of one copy each of TRE2S and 21-bp sequence is required for efficient trans activation by Tax. In the trans activation of multiple copies of 21-bp sequence, CREB/ATF protein plays an essential role in forming a complex with Tax. To understand the role of TRE2S in trans activation of one copy of 21-bp sequence, we examined protein binding to the DNA elements by DNA affinity precipitation assay including Gli2 protein binding to TRE2S and CREB protein binding to 21-bp sequence. Binding of CREB to a DNA probe containing both elements, TRE2S-21bp probe, was dependent on Gli2 protein under restricted conditions and was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by the binding of Gli2 protein to the same probe. Mutation in either element abolished the efficient binding of CREB. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of a fragment of Gli2 was able to bind to CREB. Therefore, Gli2-CREB interaction on the DNA probe is proposed to stabilize CREB binding to DNA. Tax can bind to CREB protein on the DNA; therefore, stabilization of DNA binding of CREB results in more recruitment of Tax onto DNA. Conversely, Tax increased the DNA binding of CREB, although it had almost no effect on the binding of Gli2. These results suggest that Gli2 binds to the DNA element and interacts with CREB, resulting in more recruitment of Tax, which in turn stabilizes DNA binding of CREB. Similar cooperation of the protein binding to TRE2S-21bp probe was also observed in nuclear extract of an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line. Consistent with the Gli2-CREB interaction on the DNA elements, Tax-mediated trans activation was dependent on the size of the spacer between TRE2S and 21-bp sequence. The effective sizes of the spacer suggest that TRE2S in the LTR would cooperate with the second and third copies of the 21-bp sequence and contribute to trans activation of the viral gene transcription.","['Dan, S', 'Tanimura, A', 'Yoshida, M']","['Dan S', 'Tanimura A', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (GLI2 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'DNA/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli2']",,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.4.3258-3263.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Apr;73(4):3258-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.4.3258-3263.1999.,,PMC104089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, chimeric proteins in which either the N-terminal or the C-terminal part of Pit2 was replaced by the Pit1 sequence all retained A-MuLV receptor function. A possible interpretation of these observations is that Pit1 harbors sequences which can specify A-MuLV receptor function when presented in a protein context other than Pit1, e.g., in Pit1-Pit2 hybrids. We reasoned that such Pit1 sequences might be identified if presented in the Neurospora crassa protein Pho-4. This protein is distantly related to Pit1 and Pit2, predicted to have a similar membrane topology with five extracellular loops, and does not support A-MuLV entry. We show here that introduction of the Pit1-specific loop 2 sequence conferred A-MuLV receptor function upon Pho-4. Therefore, we conclude that (i) a functional A-MuLV receptor can be constructed by combining sequences from two proteins each lacking A-MuLV receptor function and that (ii) a Pit1 sequence can specify A-MuLV receptor function when presented in another protein context than that provided by Pit1 itself. Previous results indicated a role of loop 4 residues in A-MuLV entry, and the presence of a Pit2-specific loop 4 sequence was found here to confer A-MuLV receptor function upon Pho-4. Moreover, the introduction of a Pit1-specific loop 4 sequence, but not of a Pit2-specific loop 4 sequence, abolished the A-MuLV receptor function of a Pho-4 chimera harboring the Pit1-specific loop 2 sequence. Together, these data suggest that residues in both loop 2 and loop 4 play a role in A-MuLV receptor function. A-MuLV is, however, not dependent on the specific Pit2 loop 2 and Pit2 loop 4 sequences for entry; rather, the role played by loops 2 and 4 in A-MuLV entry can be fulfilled by several different combinations of loop 2 and loop 4 sequences. We predict that the residues in loops 2 and 4, identified in this study as specifying A-MuLV receptor function, are to be found among those not conserved among Pho-4, Pit1, and Pit2.","['Lundorf, M D', 'Pedersen, F S', ""O'Hara, B"", 'Pedersen, L']","['Lundorf MD', 'Pedersen FS', ""O'Hara B"", 'Pedersen L']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis', '*Virus Replication']",,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.4.3169-3175.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Apr;73(4):3169-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.4.3169-3175.1999.,,PMC104079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that GALV can infect E36 cells by using both its own receptor, HaPit1, and the A-MuLV receptor, HaPit2. Given that the two cell lines are from the same species, the loss of function of both of these receptors in CHOK1 cells is surprising. Other studies have shown that CHOK1 cells secrete proteins that block A-MuLV entry into CHOK1 as well as E36, suggesting the two A-MuLV receptors are functionally identical. However, CHOK1 conditioned medium does not block GALV entry into E36, indicating the secreted inhibitors do not block HaPit1. HaPit1 and ChoPit1 therefore differ as receptors for GALV; ChoPit1 is either inactivated by secreted factors or intrinsically nonfunctional. To determine why GALV cannot infect CHOK1, we cloned and sequenced ChoPit1 and ChoPit2. ChoPit2 is almost identical to HaPit2, which explains why CHOK1 conditioned medium blocks A-MuLV entry via both receptors. Although ChoPit1 and HaPit1 are 91% identical, a notable difference is at position 550 in the fourth extracellular region, shown by several studies to be crucial for GALV infection. Pit1 and HaPit1 have aspartate at 550, whereas ChoPit1 has threonine at this position. We assessed the significance of this difference for GALV infection by replacing the aspartate 550 in Pit1 with threonine. This single substitution rendered Pit1 nonfunctional for GALV and suggests that threonine at 550 inactivates ChoPit1 as a GALV receptor. Whether native ChoPit1 functions for GALV was determined by interference assays using Lec8, a glycosylation-deficient derivative of CHOK1 that is susceptible to both viruses and that has the same receptors as CHOK1. Unlike with E36, GALV and A-MuLV exhibited reciprocal interference when infecting Lec8, suggesting that they use the same receptor. We conclude both viruses can use ChoPit2 in the absence of the inhibitors secreted by CHOK1 and ChoPit1 is nonfunctional.","['Chaudry, G J', 'Farrell, K B', 'Ting, Y T', 'Schmitz, C', 'Lie, S Y', 'Petropoulos, C J', 'Eiden, M V']","['Chaudry GJ', 'Farrell KB', 'Ting YT', 'Schmitz C', 'Lie SY', 'Petropoulos CJ', 'Eiden MV']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Virus Replication']",,1999/03/12 03:04,2000/04/15 09:00,['1999/03/12 03:04'],"['1999/03/12 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/12 03:04 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.4.2916-2920.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Apr;73(4):2916-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.4.2916-2920.1999.,,PMC104050,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explored the possibility that the posttranscriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE) might help resolve this problem. Insertion of the WPRE in the 3' untranslated region of coding sequences carried by either oncoretroviral or lentiviral vectors substantially increased their levels of expression in a transgene-, promoter- and vector-independent manner. The WPRE thus increased either luciferase or green fluorescent protein production five- to eightfold, and effects of a comparable magnitude were observed with either the immediate-early cytomegalovirus or the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter and with both human immunodeficiency virus- and murine leukemia virus-based vectors. The WPRE exerted this influence only when placed in the sense orientation, consistent with its predicted posttranscriptional mechanism of action. These results demonstrate that the WPRE significantly improves the performance of retroviral vectors and emphasize that posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression should be taken into account in the design of gene delivery systems.","['Zufferey, R', 'Donello, J E', 'Trono, D', 'Hope, T J']","['Zufferey R', 'Donello JE', 'Trono D', 'Hope TJ']","['Department of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Geneva Medical School, CH-120 Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hepatitis B Virus, Woodchuck/*genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Retroviridae']",,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.4.2886-2892.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Apr;73(4):2886-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.4.2886-2892.1999.,"['T32 CA064041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA64041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC104046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral vectors expressing the Gag/Pr or SU protein of the lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) were constructed and used to evaluate EIAV-specific CTL responses in horses. Three promoters, cytomegalovirus, simian virus SV40, and Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MoMSV) long terminal repeat (LTR), were used, and there was considerable variation in their ability to direct expression of Gag/Pr and SU. Vectors expressing EIAV proteins under the direction of MoMSV LTR and using the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) Env for internalization were efficient at transducing equine kidney (EK) target cells and were effective targets for EIAV-specific CTL lysis. CTL from EIAV-infected horses caused lysis of retroviral vector-transduced EK cells expressing either Gag/Pr or SU in an ELA-A-restricted manner. In contrast, lysis of recombinant vaccinia virus-infected EK cells expressing Gag/Pr and SU/TM was often non-LA-A restricted. Five horses were immunized by direct intramuscular injection with a mixture of retroviral vectors expressing Gag/Pr or SU, and one responded with EIAV-specific CTL. This result indicates that retroviral vector stimulation of CTL in horses needs to be optimized, perhaps by inclusion of appropriate cytokine genes in the constructs. However, the studies demonstrated that retroviral vector-transduced target cells were very effective for in vitro dissection of EIAV-specific CTL responses.","['Lonning, S M', 'Zhang, W', 'Leib, S R', 'McGuire, T C']","['Lonning SM', 'Zhang W', 'Leib SR', 'McGuire TC']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (SU protein, equine infectious anemia virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'DNA, Recombinant/immunology', 'Equine Infectious Anemia/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Horses/immunology/virology', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines']",,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.4.2762-2769.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Apr;73(4):2762-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.4.2762-2769.1999.,"['AI01260/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI24291/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC104033,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of the liver-enriched protein, hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), in mediating transcriptional regulation of the Factor VIII and IX genes. Using transient transfection assays in HepG2 hepatoma cells, we demonstrated the ability of HLF alone and in synergistic combination with the D-box binding protein (DBP), another proline and acidic-rich (PAR) protein family member, to transactivate these promoters. HLF is capable of binding to multiple sites in both the Factor VIII and Factor IX promoters. At least some of the synergistic activation of the Factor VIII promoter seen with HLF and DBP cotransfection can be attributed to increased binding of HLF-DBP heterodimers to two Factor VIII promoter sites. We have also demonstrated that an E2A-HLF chimera, derived from a t(17;19) translocation in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, is capable of mediating expression from the Factor VIII and Factor IX promoters in both hepatoma cells and pre-B ALL cells. These observations indicate that the PAR family of transcription factors plays an important and complex role in regulating expression of the Factor VIII and Factor IX genes, involving the binding of both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of HLF and DBP to several sites in the promoters. Finally, these studies reaffirm the potential role of dimeric transcription factor complexes in mediating interactions with specific promoter elements, which, in the case of the Factor VIII promoter, results in dramatically enhanced binding of HLF-DBP heterodimers to two cis-acting sequences. These observations further our understanding of the role played by members of the PAR family of transcription factors in regulating expression of the Factor VIII and Factor IX genes.","['Begbie, M', 'Mueller, C', 'Lillicrap, D']","['Begbie M', 'Mueller C', 'Lillicrap D']","[""Department of Pathology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DBP protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Factor IX/*genetics', 'Factor VIII/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104454999315556 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1999 Feb;18(2):165-73. doi: 10.1089/104454999315556.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacologic basis for this treatment includes a favorable tumor dose-response curve that abrogates intrinsic drug resistance associated with these diseases and facilitates cure or prolongation of survival even in the absence of a cure. The belief that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a palliative disease of the elderly has been perpetuated, limiting the application of more aggressive therapies. The introduction of fludarabine and its use in combination with other agents has increased the morphologic complete response rate observed in the initial treatment of CLL, providing the rationale to explore further disease-consolidative therapies. Concomitant with this, several phase II studies have demonstrated the feasibility of performing both allogeneic and autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with CLL. In this regard, allogeneic transplantation has produced prolonged remissions in young patients with relapsed and refractory CLL, but at the cost of high treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Application of ""minitransplantation"" regimens may temper the frequency of these complications and warrants further study. Autologous stem-cell transplantation has also been explored with promising disease-free survival outcomes in less heavily pretreated patients. However, relapses continue to be the most frequent source of late mortality, as has been observed previously with multiple myeloma. With scientific justification established in similar diseases and demonstrated feasibility with low morbidity, we believe the time for a randomized comparison of standard chemotherapy versus autologous stem-cell transplantation in CLL has arrived.

Despite high rates of complete remission (CR), many patients relapse after chemotherapy alone. Dose-intensive therapy and stem-cell transplantation (SCT) have been able to rescue some of these patients. However, many patients presently are being cured using intensive consolidation chemotherapy during first remission (CRI) and at a lower cost and toxicity than with SCT. The use of SCT in CRI should be governed by an assessment of known risk factors. Among younger adults in the prime transplant age group (< 50 years), there is no advantage to allogeneic (allo)-SCT across the board, but it is recommended for those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL or pro-B ALL with t(4;11) and possibly for those with B-lineage ALL and initial WBC counts > 100,000/microL. There is as yet no evidence that allo-SCT can improve the already high cure rate achieved with chemotherapy alone in favorable subsets such as T-cell ALL. There appears to be no advantage to autologous (auto)-SCT over chemotherapy for consolidation of either high-risk or standard-risk patients in CRI. The argument that early use of auto-SCT shortens the duration of treatment and thereby improves the quality of life is not persuasive, as there is little morbidity from maintenance chemotherapy. Patients who receive a modern, intensive multiagent chemotherapy program for CRI but later relapse are unlikely to be cured with additional chemotherapy alone. High-grade multidrug resistance develops rapidly. These patients should undergo allo-SCT if possible. Unfortunately, allo-SCT is available to only a minority of such patients because of the lack of a donor or insurance coverage, or the presence of comorbid conditions or older age. The use of alternative donors (either matched, unrelated donors or partially human leukocyte antigen [HLA] matched family members) is appropriate in this circumstance.

Cyclins, cdks, and cdk inhibitors are frequently deregulated in cancers. This chapter reviews the prognostic significance of alterations in cdk inhibitors. Loss of p27 protein provides independent prognostic information in breast, prostate, colon, and gastric carcinomas, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p27 may eventually become part of routine histopathologic processing of cancers. Loss of IHC staining for p21 may be prognostic in certain cancers but conflicting results are reported in breast cancer. Reports on homozygous deletion of p16 and p15 genes suggest the value of larger, prospective studies with standardized treatment protocols to definitively establish the prognostic utility of p15/p16 deletions in acute leukemias. Larger trials and the development of a consensus on methods for deletion analysis, IHC staining, and tumor scoring will be needed to move these molecular assays from bench to bedside.","['Tsihlias, J', 'Kapusta, L', 'Slingerland, J']","['Tsihlias J', 'Kapusta L', 'Slingerland J']","['Department of Urology, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Med,Annual review of medicine,2985151R,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Coloring Agents', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Genes, p16/genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",92,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.med.50.1.401 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Med. 1999;50:401-23. doi: 10.1146/annurev.med.50.1.401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, infusions of leukocytes collected from the original transplant donor have been used to induce a direct graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction in patients with relapsed disease. Adoptive immunotherapy with donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) results in complete remission for 60-80% of patients with relapsed chronic-phase CML; therapy is also effective for relapse of diseases other than CML, although response rates are lower. Adoptive immunotherapy induces remissions for the majority of patients with post-transplantation Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphomas and other viral-associated illnesses. The extraordinary success of DLI demonstrates that it is now possible to harness the GVL potential of the human immune system for clinical benefit. The necessary effector cells and target antigens required for GVL reactivity are poorly defined but are the subject of intensive investigation. Future trials will investigate strategies that retain and enhance the GVL effects while limiting toxicity from this therapy, and they may define methods of successful allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy outside the setting of allogeneic BMT.","['Porter, D L', 'Antin, J H']","['Porter DL', 'Antin JH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia 19104, USA. dlporter@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Med,Annual review of medicine,2985151R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*physiology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma/therapy/virology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Virus Infections/therapy']",80,1999/03/12 00:00,1999/03/12 00:01,['1999/03/12 00:00'],"['1999/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.med.50.1.369 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Med. 1999;50:369-86. doi: 10.1146/annurev.med.50.1.369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with TRL/t-MDS diagnosed at the National Cancer Center Hospital between January 1989 and September 1997. This report is concerned with those patients who initially had been treated with chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (median age, 55 years) developed TRL (n = 4) or t-MDS (n = 9). The median interval between the development of TRL/t-MDS and initial treatment was 94 months (range 23-190 months). For the primary therapy, all patients had received intense and prolonged treatment with cyclophosphamide (CPA) and/or anthracyclines including doxorubicin (DOX), with a median cumulative dose of 55 g/body (range 16.4-288.5 g) for CPA and 480 mg/m2 (range 395-625.5 mg/m2) for DOX. Seven patients were subsequently treated by chemotherapy and one received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must remain alert to the risks associated with unproven medical practices which include long-term administration of alkylating agents.

The t(15; 17) translocation leads to the production of the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein which plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of APL by arresting normal differentiation of myeloid precursors. However, in the presence of high concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein serves to stimulate cell differentiation. The diagnosis of APL and the detection of residual disease are based on the t(15; 17) translocation. Treatment with a combination of ATRA and anthracycline-AraC chemotherapy has shown a higher rate of complete remission in APL. We report the case of a 71-year-old male with the rare microgranular variant of APL to illustrate these findings. The patient was treated with a combination of ATRA and Daunorubicin-AraC chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. He developed retinoic acid syndrome as a complication of therapy with ATRA.

Transgenic mice were produced by constructing DNAs that express the tax gene alone under the control of either its own LTR or CD4 enhancer/promoter and by microinjecting them into C3H/HeN-fertilized ova. We produced seven transgenic mice carrying the LTR-tax gene and nine mice carrying the CD4-tax and found that one of the LTR-tax-Tg mice and five of CD4-tax-Tg mice developed RA-like inflammatory arthropathy similar to LTR-pX-Tg mice, indicating that the tax gene is arthritogenic. On the other hand, the other two LTR-tax-Tg mice had ankylotic changes caused by new bone formation without inflammation. In these ankylotic mice, tax mRNA, inflammatory cytokine mRNA, and autoantibody levels except for TGF-beta1 level were lower than those in LTR-pX- or CD4-tax-Tg mice.

The CML cells exhibit anchorage-independent cell growth and genetic instability. After the initial phase, the cells acquire the phenotype of growth factor-independent growth. After the chronic phase, the disease evolves into the accelerated and blastic phases through the process of sequential random mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To identify some of the genetic changes that contribute to the phenotype of blastic and accelerated phase cells, we used differential display PCR to compare levels of cDNA reverse transcripts of mRNA in 32Dc13 cells and 32Dc13 cells that were stably transfected with a bcrabl cDNA plasmid in a constitutively expressed transcription unit. These cells were designated 32Dc13P210bcrabl. For these studies, we used the 32D myeloid leukemia cell line, which depends on IL-3 for growth. RESULTS: Following introduction of the bcr-abl cDNA through transfection, the cell line became growth factor independent, mimicking the change in phenotype that occurs during the later phases of CML. These differential display screening assays detected altered levels of transcripts for 28 genes. Of interest to the biology of growth factor-independent growth in the bcrabl-positive 32D cells was the fact that the C10 beta chemokine gene was expressed at higher levels in the 32Dc13 cells than in the 32Dc13P210bcrabl cells. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that a C10 beta chemokine gene was expressed at different levels with or without P210bcrabl.","['Lane, C M', 'Guo, X Y', 'Macaluso, L H', 'Yung, K C', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Lane CM', 'Guo XY', 'Macaluso LH', 'Yung KC', 'Deisseroth AB']","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chemokines, CC/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/11 00:00,1999/03/11 00:01,['1999/03/11 00:00'],"['1999/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Med. 1999 Jan;5(1):55-61.,['P30 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2230372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present two lines of evidence implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in SCA3/MJD pathogenesis. First, studies of both human disease tissue and in vitro models showed redistribution of the 26S proteasome complex into polyglutamine aggregates. In neurons from SCA3/MJD brain, the proteasome localized to intranuclear inclusions containing the mutant protein, ataxin-3. In transfected cells, the proteasome redistributed into inclusions formed by three expanded polyglutamine proteins: a pathologic ataxin-3 fragment, full-length mutant ataxin-3 and an unrelated GFP-polyglutamine fusion protein. Inclusion formation by the full-length mutant ataxin-3 required nuclear localization of the protein and occurred within specific subnuclear structures recently implicated in the regulation of cell death, promyelocytic leukemia antigen oncogenic domains. In a second set of experiments, inhibitors of the proteasome caused a repeat length-dependent increase in aggregate formation, implying that the proteasome plays a direct role in suppressing polyglutamine aggregation in disease. These results support a central role for protein misfolding in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD and suggest that modulating proteasome activity is a potential approach to altering the progression of this and other polyglutamine diseases.","['Chai, Y', 'Koppenhafer, S L', 'Shoesmith, S J', 'Perez, M K', 'Paulson, H L']","['Chai Y', 'Koppenhafer SL', 'Shoesmith SJ', 'Perez MK', 'Paulson HL']","['Department of Neurology, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (ATXN3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ataxin-3)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Atxn3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Ataxin-3', 'Brain/enzymology/pathology', 'Brain Chemistry', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inclusion Bodies/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Machado-Joseph Disease/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Multienzyme Complexes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry', 'PC12 Cells', 'Peptides/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Repressor Proteins']",,1999/03/11 00:00,1999/03/11 00:01,['1999/03/11 00:00'],"['1999/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['ddc073 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/8.4.673 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1999 Apr;8(4):673-82. doi: 10.1093/hmg/8.4.673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In MOLT-4 cells treated with Trolox after X-irradiation, viability, DNA fragmentation, expression of p53, BCL-2, BAX, active SAPK/JNK, active caspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP were measured by the trypan blue exclusion test, agarose gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. RESULTS: Stained cells and ladder-like DNA cleavage were observed after X-irradiation. Cell death and DNA fragmentation were significantly inhibited by the post-irradiation treatment with Trolox. The expression of p53 and active SAPK/JNK was increased after X-irradiation, and fragments of PARP and the activated fragment of caspase-3 were produced. Post-irradiation treatment with Trolox attenuated the X-irradiation-induced expression, fragmentation or activation of these apoptosis-related biomolecules. The expression of BCL-2 and BAX, which would occur downstream from p53, was not changed by irradiation and Trolox treatment.

It is unknown how the ABO blood group is expressed in hemopoietic stem cells. In an attempt to verify the ABO mRNA expression in hemopoietic precursor cells, mRNAs were isolated from human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines which are believed to be at the most immature level of hemopoietic differentiation among hemopoietic malignancies. In particular, K-562 and KOPM-28 cells were used with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique for amplifying ABO gene transcripts. The amplified ABO cDNAs from two cell lines were characterized by the digestion of Kpn-I restriction enzyme. The blood types were determined by polymerase chain reaction of the specific allele (PASA) method. Both of the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines expressed ABO mRNA. The quantity of ABO mRNA in the K-562 cell line is significantly higher than that of the KOPM-28 cell line. The ABO blood type of these two cell lines was type O. Because the CML cell lines are presumed to be at the immature stem cell level of hematopoietic cell differentiation and because it is believed that the cultured cell lines from hematologic malignancy reflect the characteristics of normal corresponding hemopoietic cells, the hemopoietic stem cells should express mRNA of the ABO blood group.","['Hosoi, E', 'Hirose, M', 'Hamano, S', 'Kuroda, Y']","['Hosoi E', 'Hirose M', 'Hamano S', 'Kuroda Y']","['Department of Medical Technology, School of Medical Science, The University of Tokushima, Tokushima City, Japan. hosoi@medsci.tokushima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/11 00:00,1999/03/11 00:01,['1999/03/11 00:00'],"['1999/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(98)00225-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00225-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Nov 27;133(2):191-6. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00225-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the clinical features of patients with MDS accompanied by nephrotic syndrome. We enrolled 125 patients with MDS who were admitted between January 1979 and May 1996 in this study. The renal function was assessed based on the laboratory data and the findings at the physical examination. The diagnoses of nephrotic syndrome and glomerular disease were established when 24-hr urinary excretion was more than 3.5 g and serum total protein was less than 6.0 g/dl, and when the 24-hr protein excretion was more than 1.5 g. Five patients (4%) had glomerular disease, and three (2.4%) had nephrotic syndrome. Of the five patients with glomerular disease, two had refractory anemia (RA), and three had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMOL). Three of the total 11 patients with CMMOL were diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome. Among the CMMOL patients, those with nephrotic syndrome showed higher absolute monocyte numbers than did those without nephrotic syndrome (8830 +/- 4677/microl vs. 3061 +/- 2887/microl, P = 0.03). One CMMOL patient was treated with VP-16 and hydroxyurea. As the white blood cell count in this patient decreased, the 24-hr urine protein excretion and the serum tumor necrosis factor alpha level decreased. The relationship between nephrotic syndrome and CMMOL was not clear. High monocyte count and the serum cytokines in MDS patients may play a partial role in the evolution of glomerulonephritis, and CMMOL may be closely related to nephrotic syndrome.","['Saitoh, T', 'Murakami, H', 'Uchiumi, H', 'Moridaira, K', 'Maehara, T', 'Matsushima, T', 'Tsukamoto, N', 'Tamura, J', 'Karasawa, M', 'Naruse, T', 'Tsuchiya, J']","['Saitoh T', 'Murakami H', 'Uchiumi H', 'Moridaira K', 'Maehara T', 'Matsushima T', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Tamura J', 'Karasawa M', 'Naruse T', 'Tsuchiya J']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Autoimmunity', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/immunology', '*Nephrotic Syndrome/blood/immunology']",,1999/03/11 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/11 03:01'],"['1999/03/11 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/11 03:01 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199903)60:3<200::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199903)60:3<200::aid-ajh6>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Mar;60(3):200-4. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199903)60:3<200::aid-ajh6>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the expression of cytoplasmic bcl-2 by human Bone Marrow Mast Cells (BMMC) from both normal and pathological bone marrow samples was examined. A total of 35 subjects corresponding to 9 healthy volunteers, 8 cases of adult indolent systemic mast cell disease (SMCD), 4 cases of pediatric mastocytosis (PM), 11 cases of hematological malignancies (HM), 2 cases of reactive bone marrow, and 1 case of mast cell leukemia (MCL) were analyzed. The expression of bcl-2 was studied using quantitative three-color flow cytometry. We also studied the molecular configuration of the bcl-2 gene and other relatives by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the MCL case. Bcl-2 expression was detected in BMMC from all samples analyzed. No significant differences on the expression of bcl-2 were detected between BMMC from healthy subjects and patients with SMCD, PM, HM, and reactive bone marrow. By contrast, bcl-2 protein was overexpressed in BMMC from MCL patient without gene rearrangement. Our results show that bcl-2 protein was constitutively expressed by BMMC. BMMC from MCL display overexpression of bcl-2, which could not be related to molecular rearrangements involving the bcl-2 gene. The expression of this protein by mature MC may play a role in the prevention of MC apoptosis and thus help to explain the long survival of these cells.

The efficacy of the therapy against leukemia (defined as the increase in lifespan, ILS) was assessed as the percentage of the median survival time (MST) of the treated group (T) to that of the control group (C): ILS = [(MSTc/MSTT-1] x 100. The survival time of mice bearing L1210 or P388 leukemia treated with dFdC before 2-CdA was significantly prolonged as compared with the animals receiving these agents separately. The prolongation of the survival time of the treated mice (ILS) compared with the untreated was 300% in case of L1210 and 241% in case of P388 leukemia. The combinations 2-CdA before dFdC and simultaneous injections of both drugs were not more effective than the treatment with dFdC alone. In case of L1210 leukemia, mice treated with these regimens showed a survival time similar to those treated with dFdC alone, although the survival time of mice bearing P388 leukemia treated with these regimens was shorter than that of mice given dFdC singly. Our study revealed that the most effective treatment schedule in both leukemias was dFdC given before 2-CdA. The results confirm the additive action of dFdC and 2-CdA.","['Maranda, E', 'Szmigielska, A', 'Robak, T']","['Maranda E', 'Szmigielska A', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice']",,1999/03/11 00:00,1999/03/11 00:01,['1999/03/11 00:00'],"['1999/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07357909909011722 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1999;17(2):95-101. doi: 10.1080/07357909909011722.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with conventional bone marrow, faster engraftment is consistently observed with G-PBMC, with differences more pronounced in platelet than in neutrophil recovery. G-PBMC contain not only severalfold more CD34+ cells than bone marrow but also, on average, 50-fold more monocytes, which may stimulate stromal cell function and facilitate engraftment. Although G-PBMC also contain 10-fold more T cells, the incidence and severity of acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) is no higher than that observed in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Hypothetically, these clinical observations can be explained by the direct effect of G-CSF on T cell function as demonstrated by polarization of T cells expressing the T helper type 2 (Th 2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 in the murine model. Alternatively, G-PBMC may contain cells that actively suppress donor T cell responsiveness. Recent reports indicate that the large number of CD14+ monocytes in G-PBMC can suppress donor T cell proliferation in vitro. This effect may be attributable to both the increased ratio of CD14+:CD3+ cells in G-PBMC and the evidence that CD14+ cells in G-PBMC have decreased expression of both B7.2 and HLA-DR. There is some indication that natural killer (NK) cell number and function may be augmented in G-PBMC, which could have a favorable impact on the graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect. Therefore, both the CD34+ and accessory cell content of G-PBMC may be important in early engraftment by controlling acute GVHD and facilitating GVL.","['Tanaka, J', 'Imamura, M', 'Kasai, M', 'Asaka, M', 'Torok-Storb, B']","['Tanaka J', 'Imamura M', 'Kasai M', 'Asaka M', 'Torok-Storb B']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/classification/immunology/*transplantation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Count', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Monocytes/classification', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",50,1999/03/11 00:00,1999/03/11 00:01,['1999/03/11 00:00'],"['1999/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1999 Feb;69(2):70-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1976, however, phenomenal scientific advances have provided new insights into the biology and genetics of the acute leukemias and myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic diseases. Immunophenotyping approaches have begun to supplant more traditional cytochemical assays for lineage determination, and cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies led to the identification and cloning of the genes involved in a large number of the recurrent genetic abnormalities in these diseases. New automated molecular technologies, reviewed in this article, now allow rapid and sensitive detection of these genetic abnormalities in leukemic cells. Such immunophenotyping and molecular genetic information is now considered crucial for both diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. As our scientific knowledge and diagnostic sophistication increases, classification schemes for these disorders based solely on morphologic features are increasingly seen as unsatisfactory.

These neoplasms are recognized mostly on the basis of their histopathologic features, but ancillary studies are useful in confirming and sometimes making the diagnosis. Clinically, the small B-cell lymphomas of lymph nodes and spleen (but not those of MALT type) are usually disseminated at diagnosis and considered incurable. With the exception of mantle cell lymphoma, however, they are generally indolent. The small B-cell lymphomas are among the best examples of how malignant lymphomas can be related to the normal immune system. Although uncertainties exist, these lymphomas are generally considered the neoplastic equivalents of normal B-cell compartments. From a molecular perspective, mantle cell and follicular lymphomas are the best characterized. In both cases, there are characteristic chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain and the cyclin D1 or bcl-2 genes, respectively, that are probably followed by additional molecular events leading to overt neoplasia.

It also noted that the site(s) of presentation were often a signpost for important underlying biologic distinctions. The inclusion of clinical criteria for the definition of disease entities was one of the more novel aspects of the REAL classification. These principles of classification of lymphomas and leukemias also have an impact on diagnostic hematopathology. The REAL classification stresses that diagnoses are based on a multiparameter approach.

A search of MEDLINE from 1966 to October 1998 was performed. RESULTS: A wealth of data has been published on the role of Ras pathways in cancer. To be biologically active, Ras must move from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Importantly, a posttranslational modification--addition of a farnesyl group to the Ras C-terminal cysteine--is a requisite for membrane localization of Ras. Farnesylation of Ras is catalyzed by an enzyme that is designated farnesyltransferase. Recently, several compounds have been developed that can inhibit farnesylation. Preclinical studies indicate that these molecules can suppress transformation and tumor growth in vitro and in animal models, with little toxicity to normal cells. CONCLUSION: An increasing body of data suggests that disruption of Ras signaling pathways, either directly through mutations or indirectly through other genetic aberrations, is important in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of cancers. Molecules such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors that interfere with the function of Ras may be exploitable in leukemia (as well as in solid tumors) as novel antitumor agents.","['Beaupre, D M', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Beaupre DM', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', '*Genes, ras/drug effects', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",116,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.1071 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):1071-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.1071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter observational study was performed at five academic tertiary care hospitals. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained on consecutive cancer patients at initiation of mechanical ventilation, and information on vital status at hospital discharge was acquired. RESULTS: Our analysis was based on 782 adult cancer patients who met predetermined inclusion criteria. The overall observed hospital mortality was 76%, with no statistically significant differences among the five study centers. Seven variables (intubation after 24 hours, leukemia, progression or recurrence of cancer, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, cardiac arrhythmias, presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and need for vasopressor therapy) were associated with an increased risk of death, whereas prior surgery with curative intent was protective. The predictive model based on these variables had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.736, with Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics of 7.19; P = .52. CONCLUSION: This model can be used to estimate the probability of hospital survival for classes of adult cancer patients who require mechanical ventilation and can help to guide physicians, patients, and families in deciding goals and direction of treatment. Prospective independent validation in different medical settings is warranted.","['Groeger, J S', 'White, P Jr', 'Nierman, D M', 'Glassman, J', 'Shi, W', 'Horak, D', 'Price, K']","['Groeger JS', 'White P Jr', 'Nierman DM', 'Glassman J', 'Shi W', 'Horak D', 'Price K']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. groegerj@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Critical Care', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', '*Respiration, Artificial/mortality', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/03/10 03:01,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/03/10 03:01'],"['1999/03/10 03:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):991-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.991.,['R03 HD068173/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analyzed the survival experience and presenting clinical and laboratory features of boys and girls with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated at our institution over the past three decades. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand one hundred fifty-one boys and 904 girls were treated in 13 consecutive Total Therapy studies between 1962 and 1994. An overview analysis was used to investigate the impact of sex on overall and event-free survival, both for the entire cohort and for subgroups defined by treatment era and blast-cell immunophenotype. Stratified analyses were performed to adjust for treatment protocol and known risk factors, and in the modern treatment era, for protocol, immunophenotype, and the DNA content of leukemic cells (ie, DNA index). The pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, teniposide, and cytarabine, as well as the thiopurine methyltransferase activity of erythrocytes, were compared between boys and girls treated on a single protocol. RESULTS: Compared with girls, boys were more likely to have T-cell ALL (20.9% v 10.7%, P < .001) and seemed less likely to have a favorable DNA index (17.8% v 25.1%, P = .072). There were no other statistically significant differences between the two sexes with respect to presenting features, including leukemic-cell genetic abnormalities, nor were there significant sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, teniposide, or cytarabine or in erythrocyte thiopurine methyltransferase activity. Girls clearly fared better than boys (P < .001) on protocols used during the early era of treatment (10-year event-free survival +/- 1 SE, 43.1%+/-2.1% v 31.5%+/-1.7%). Although prognosis improved for both sexes in the modern era, the difference in outcome between girls and boys persisted (P = .025) (10-year event-free survival, 73.4%+/-3.7% v 63.5%+/-4.0%). However, stratification of modern-era patients by protocol, immunophenotype, and DNA index mitigated statistical evidence of a sex difference in overall survival (P = .263) and event-free survival (P = .124). CONCLUSION: Although boys and girls alike have benefited from improvements in ALL therapy, these gains have not completely eliminated the sex difference in prognosis that has persisted since the early 1960s. The apparent difference in outcome is partially explained by differences between boys and girls in the distributions of ALL immunophenotype and DNA index.","['Pui, C H', 'Boyett, J M', 'Relling, M V', 'Harrison, P L', 'Rivera, G K', 'Behm, F G', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Gajjar, A', 'Evans, W E']","['Pui CH', 'Boyett JM', 'Relling MV', 'Harrison PL', 'Rivera GK', 'Behm FG', 'Sandlund JT', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Gajjar A', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and University of Tennessee, College of Medicine and Pharmacy, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.818 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):818-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.818.,"['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1994 and July 1996, 50 consecutive patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies in first remission or relapse received high-dose therapy followed by transplantation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized, allogeneic PBSCs collected from HLA-identical siblings. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine and corticosteroids. RESULTS: As of April 1, 1998, 18 patients (36%+/-13%) survived with a median follow-up period of 767 days (range, 602 to 1,127 days). The actuarial probability of grades 2-4 acute GVHD was 0.37+/-0.14 (95% confidence interval). Of 36 assessable patients, 26 (72%+/-15%) developed chronic GVHD. The actuarial probability of chronic GVHD 2 years after transplantation was 0.87+/-0.15. Of 14 progression-free survivors, 11 (79%+/-22%) have active, chronic GVHD. All 11 patients require ongoing immunosuppression, and nearly two thirds have extensive disease. Thirteen patients died as a result of transplant-related mortality (26%+/-12%), six (12%) before and seven (14%) after day +100. CONCLUSION: We observed a high risk of chronic GVHD after allogeneic PBSC transplantation, which compromised the performance status of most long-term survivors and resulted in a relatively high risk of late transplant-related mortality. Approximately 75% of transplant-related deaths were associated with GVHD; thus, reduction in transplant-related mortality after allogeneic PBSC transplantation will require more effective strategies for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of GVHD.","['Brown, R A', 'Adkins, D', 'Khoury, H', 'Vij, R', 'Goodnough, L T', 'Shenoy, S', 'DiPersio, J F']","['Brown RA', 'Adkins D', 'Khoury H', 'Vij R', 'Goodnough LT', 'Shenoy S', 'DiPersio JF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA. rbrown@im.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.806 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):806-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.806.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-eight HRCT studies were performed prospectively in 112 neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin persisting for more than 48 hours despite empiric antibiotic treatment. Fifty-four of these studies were performed in transplant recipients. All patients had normal chest roentgenograms. If pneumonia was detected by HRCT, guided bronchoalveolar lavage was recommended. Evidence of pneumonia on chest roentgenograms during follow-up and micro-organisms detected during follow-up were regarded as documentation of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 188 HRCT studies, 112 (60%) showed pneumonia and 76 were normal. Documentation of pneumonia was possible in 61 cases by chest roentgenography or micro-organism detection (54%) (P < 10(-6)). Sensitivity of HRCT was 87% (88% in transplant recipients), specificity was 57% (67%), and the negative predictive value was 88% (97%). A time gain of 5 days was achieved by the additional use of HRCT compared to an exclusive use of chest roentgenography. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of inflammatory pulmonary disease after a suspicious HRCT scan (> 50%) proves that pneumonia is not excluded by a normal chest roentgenogram. Given the significantly longer duration of febrile episodes in transplant recipients, HRCT findings are particularly relevant in this subgroup. Patients with normal HRCT scans, particularly transplant recipients, have a low risk of pneumonia during follow-up. All neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin and normal chest roentgenograms should undergo HRCT.","['Heussel, C P', 'Kauczor, H U', 'Heussel, G E', 'Fischer, B', 'Begrich, M', 'Mildenberger, P', 'Thelen, M']","['Heussel CP', 'Kauczor HU', 'Heussel GE', 'Fischer B', 'Begrich M', 'Mildenberger P', 'Thelen M']","['Department of Radiology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany. heussel@mail.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging', 'Pneumonia/complications/*diagnostic imaging/microbiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",,1999/03/10 03:01,2000/04/25 09:00,['1999/03/10 03:01'],"['1999/03/10 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/10 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.796 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):796-805. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.796.,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1999 Dec;17(12):3856-60.

METHODS AND RESULTS: After the observation at our institution of a rapid reduction of peripheral-blood tumor cells with associated severe pulmonary infusion-related toxicity in two patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, data on three additional cases were collected from physician-submitted reports of adverse events related to rituximab treatment. Five patients with hematologic malignancies possessing a high number of blood tumor cells were treated with rituximab and developed rapid tumor clearance. The median age was 68 years (range, 26 to 78 years). Patients were diagnosed with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1). All of these patients had bulky adenopathy or organomegaly. All five patients developed a unique syndrome of severe infusion-related reactions, thrombocytopenia, rapid decrement in circulating tumor cell load, and mild electrolyte evidence of tumor lysis, and all required hospitalization. In addition, one patient developed ascites. These events resolved, and four patients were subsequently treated with rituximab without significant complications. CONCLUSION: Rituximab administration in patients who have a high number of tumor cells in the blood may have an increased likelihood of severe initial infusion-related reactions. These data also suggest that rituximab may have activity in a variety of other lymphoid neoplasms, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.","['Byrd, J C', 'Waselenko, J K', 'Maneatis, T J', 'Murphy, T', 'Ward, F T', 'Monahan, B P', 'Sipe, M A', 'Donegan, S', 'White, C A']","['Byrd JC', 'Waselenko JK', 'Maneatis TJ', 'Murphy T', 'Ward FT', 'Monahan BP', 'Sipe MA', 'Donegan S', 'White CA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA. john_c.byrd@wramaa.chcs.amedd.army.mil']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase IV', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Rituximab', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.791 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):791-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.3.791.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fas expression was flow cytometrically unimodal with heterogeneous density and showed quantitatively characteristic features among different diseases; weak in ALL, faint in CLL, moderate in HCL, and strong in ML, respectively. Not only full-length but also alternatively spliced truncated mRNAs were detected even in leukemic B-cells with qualitatively faint or negative Fas, and then band density of the former transcripts by RT-PCR was correlated to the Fas protein expression level. Short-term culture of freshly isolated cells gave rise to increases of Fas density and susceptibility for apoptosis, suggesting that the mRNA and inducible Fas are functional at least in vitro.

The L2C cells are natural killer-sensitive. The Kurloff cell (KC), a guinea pig NK cell, develops a 3-fold increase in lysosomal enzyme activity and the number of KC cells increases during leukemogenesis, leading to KC cell-mediated L2C cytolysis. This paper shows that conjugates are produced by incubating KC and L2C for 4 h, with 34% of L2C showing chromatin compaction and shrinkage of the cytoplasm. There was also a reorientation of the KC cytoplasmic organelles to face the target cell and an elongation of the KC to produce arms that engulfed the L2C. The L2C had either necrotic or apoptotic characteristics. L2C DNA fragmentation was demonstrated in situ with the comet and the TUNEL assays. 22.2% of the viable L2C lost their membrane asymmetry during KC-L2C conjugation as shown by incubation with Annexin V-FITC. These results provide new evidence that the death of L2C is due, at least partly, to apoptosis. The cytolytic effect of the NKKC might be a model of the cytological changes that occur in NK cell-leukemic cell conjugates.","['Debout, C', 'Quillec, M', 'Izard, J']","['Debout C', 'Quillec M', 'Izard J']","[""Laboratoire d'Histologie, equipe Hydrolases et Cytotoxicite, UFR de Medecine CHU cote de Nacre, Caen, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Necrosis', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001556 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00155-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Feb;23(2):137-47. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00155-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of the p53 gene were found in three of 57 (5%) patients at diagnosis, one of 14 (7%) patients at relapse and in 12 of 18 (67%) cell lines. In these 12 cell lines, four had more than two mutations of the p53 gene. The p53 mutations were found in four of five cell lines whose original fresh leukemic cells were simultaneously examined original fresh leukemic cells. However, only one of the four fresh leukemic cells had the same mutation. All patients with p53 mutations in the course of disease died. Mutations of the p21 gene were not identified in 71 fresh samples and in 18 cell lines. N-RAS mutations were found in two of 57 (4%) fresh T-ALL patients at diagnosis, and four of 18 cell lines (22%), whereas no mutations were detected in any samples at relapse. Alterations of the p16 gene were found in 18 of 47 (38%) patients at diagnosis and in seven of 14 (50%) at relapse. These differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in the frequency of alteration of the p16 and p15 genes between event-free patients and the remaining patients. Furthermore, we found the methylation of p16 gene in three of seven patients lacking homozygous deletions, suggesting higher frequency of p16 inactivation than previous reports in T-ALL. Interestingly, we found that one allele is inactivated by methylation and another allele had nonsense mutation in one cell line (KOPT-KI), resulting in loss of protein expression of p16. This type of p16 inactivation has not been so far reported in leukemia. We conclude that, (1) p53 mutations are infrequent at diagnosis but tend to be associated with poor clinical outcome; (2) RAS and p21 mutations may not be involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL; (3) not only frequent alterations of p16 and p15 genes but also methylation of p16 gene are involved in initiating the leukemogenesis of T-ALLs, and (4) these 5 genes are independently involved in T-ALL.","['Kawamura, M', 'Ohnishi, H', 'Guo, S X', 'Sheng, X M', 'Minegishi, M', 'Hanada, R', 'Horibe, K', 'Hongo, T', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Bessho, F', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Sekiya, T', 'Hayashi, Y']","['Kawamura M', 'Ohnishi H', 'Guo SX', 'Sheng XM', 'Minegishi M', 'Hanada R', 'Horibe K', 'Hongo T', 'Kaneko Y', 'Bessho F', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Sekiya T', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p16', '*Genes, p53', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001465 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00146-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Feb;23(2):115-26. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00146-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase activity, demonstrable in most human tumors, enables them to maintain telomere stability. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sampled from 57 patients seropositive for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), including 24 asymptomatic viral carriers, ten smoldering type, five chronic type, and 18 acute type adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Telomerase activity was determined in samples using a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol. We semiquantitatively determined telomerase activity by serial dilution of each sample. All of 23 samples from acute and chronic type ATL patients were positive, seven of ten (70%) smoldering type patients and seven of 24 (29.2%) asymptomatic viral carriers were positive. Disease progression from asymptomatic viral carrier to acute type correlated with telomerase activity. Two samples from chronic type ATL patients with relatively high telomerase activity progressed to the acute type within 1 month. Serum lactate dehydrogenase level also correlated with telomerase activity. These results indicate that reactivation of telomerase activity is a key event in development and progression of ATL, and telomerase could be a useful marker for predicting the course of disease.

At the molecular level, the t(9;22) leads to the fusion of the BCR gene (on chromosome 22) to the ABL gene (translocated from chromosome 9); this fusion gene BCR-ABL with its elevated tyrosine kinase activity must to be central to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Three different breakpoint cluster regions are discerned within the BCR gene on chromosome 22: M-bcr, m-bcr, and mu-bcr. Ph + leukemia cell lines are important tools in this research area. More than 20 ALL-and more than 40 CML-derived Ph + leukemia cell lines have been described. Furthermore, three Ph + B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, established from patients with Ph + ALL or CML, are available. Molecular analysis has documented BCR-ABL fusion genes in three apparently Ph chromosome-negative cell lines, all three derived from CML. Nearly all Ph + ALL cell lines have the m-bcr e1-a2 fusion gene (only two ALL cell lines have a b3-a2 fusion) whereas all CML cell lines, but one carry the M-bcr b2-a2, b3-a2 or both hybrids. The mu-bcr e19-a2 has been detected in one CML cell line. Four cell lines display a three-way translocation involving chromosomes 9, 22 and a third chromosome. Additional Ph chromosomes (up to five) have been found in four Ph + ALL cell lines and in 18 CML cell lines; though in some cell lines the extra Ph chromosome(s) might be caused by the polyploidy (tri- and tetraploidy) of the cells. Another modus to acquire additional copies of the BCR-ABL fusion gene is the formation of tandem repeats of the BCR-ABL hybrid as seen in CML cell line K-562. Both mechanisms, selective multiplication of the der(22) chromosome and tandem replication of the fusion gene BCR-ABL, presumably lead to enhanced levels of the fusion protein and its tyrosine kinase activity (genetic dosage effect). The availability of a panel of Ph + cell lines as highly informative leukemia models offers the unique opportunity to analyze the pathobiology of these malignancies and the role of the Ph chromosome in leukemogenesis.","['Drexler, H G', 'MacLeod, R A', 'Uphoff, C C']","['Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA', 'Uphoff CC']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",84,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001714 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00171-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Mar;23(3):207-15. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00171-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning regimen included six 2-Gy fractions of total body irradiation, succeeded by cyclophosphamide at 120 mg/kg (with mesna) followed by four fractions of 1.5 Gy to lymphoid areas. Bone marrow (n=38) or peripheral blood mobilized donor mononuclear cells (n=12) were exposed ex vivo to CAMPATH-1 (IgM and complement, or IgG; antiCD52) antibodies, without any further posttransplantation immunosuppression. RESULTS: Median patient age was 31 (range 14-51) years; 12 patients were 40 or older. Thirty-two patients were male. One patient died of pulmonary hemorrhage on day 10; another died on day 29 of interstitial pneumonitis. Except for one early death, all patients engrafted. Ten (21%) of the remaining 48 who were at risk, developed GVHD. In none was it greater than grade II. Eight patients developed serious viral infections. Four died of cytomegalovirus pneumonia, adenovirus hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency. Overall, 11 patients (22%) relapsed (4 of 33 acute myeloblastic leukemia in CR1) at a median of 235 (range 46-528) days. Mean posttransplantation follow-up was 1062 (median 560; range 10-4177) days. Thirty-three patients (66%) remained disease free at a mean of 1,118 (median 1439; range 159-4,177) days. For all patients, the performance status was between 82% and 100% (median 100). CONCLUSION: T-cell depletion with CAMPATH-1 effectively prevents GVHD, particularly the severe acute forms, without leading to excessive risk of relapse in acute leukemia.","['Novitzky, N', 'Thomas, V', 'Hale, G', 'Waldmann, H']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomas V', 'Hale G', 'Waldmann H']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. novitzky@samiot.uct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin M/*therapeutic use', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199902270-00022 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1999 Feb 27;67(4):620-6. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199902270-00022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been demonstrated to be an effective drug in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia by inducing programmed cell death in leukemic cells both in vitro and in vivo. This prompted us to study the in vitro effects of As2O3 and of another arsenical derivative, the organic compound melarsoprol, on human myeloma cells and on the plasma cell differentiation of normal B cells. At pharmacological concentrations (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L), As2O3 and melarsoprol caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of survival and growth in myeloma cell lines that was, in some, similar to that of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Both arsenical compounds induced plasma cell apoptosis, as assessed by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, detection of phosphatidylserine at the cell surface using annexin V, and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay. As2O3 and melarsoprol also inhibited viability and growth and induced apoptosis in plasma-cell enriched preparations from the bone marrow or blood of myeloma patients. In nonseparated bone marrow samples, both arsenical compounds triggered death in myeloma cells while sparing most myeloid cells, as demonstrated by double staining with annexin V and CD38 or CD15 antibodies. In primary myeloma cells as in cell lines, interleukin 6 did not prevent arsenic-induced cell death or growth inhibition, and no synergistic effect was observed with IFN-alpha. In contrast to As2O3, melarsoprol only slightly reduced the plasma cell differentiation of normal B cells induced by pokeweed mitogen. Both pokeweed mitogen-induced normal plasma cells and malignant plasma cells showed a normal nuclear distribution of PML protein, which was disrupted by As2O3 but not by melarsoprol, suggesting that the two arsenical derivatives acted by different mechanisms. These results point to the use of arsenical derivatives as investigational drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Rousselot, P', 'Labaume, S', 'Marolleau, J P', 'Larghero, J', 'Noguera, M H', 'Brouet, J C', 'Fermand, J P']","['Rousselot P', 'Labaume S', 'Marolleau JP', 'Larghero J', 'Noguera MH', 'Brouet JC', 'Fermand JP']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique EP-107, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZF3786Q2E8 (Melarsoprol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Arsenic Poisoning', 'Arsenic Trioxide', '*Arsenicals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Melarsoprol/*toxicity', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/*drug effects/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Mar 1;59(5):1041-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined 44 samples of normal, metaplastic and premalignant (i.e. mild, moderate and severe dysplasias and carcinoma in situ) bronchial epithelia to evaluate whether differences in the apoptotic activity could already be seen in the stages preceding squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SQCLC). Apoptotic cells and bodies were visualized by 3' end labelling. The expression of p53 and members of the bcl-2 gene family, such as bcl-2, bax and mcl-1, were determined immunohistochemically with specific antibodies. The relative number of apoptotic cells and bodies [apoptotic index (AI%)] was already increased threefold as the normal bronchial epithelium changed to squamous metaplasia, and the AIs of the dysplastic lesions were about four times higher than those of the normal epithelium. Apoptosis was significantly associated with cell proliferation, as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. However, the extent of apoptosis did not correlate with the expression of p53, bcl-2, bax and mcl-1. We conclude that, in the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in the lung, the elevation of the AI% is an early event associated with cell proliferation activity, but is independent of the expression of p53, bcl-2, mcl-1 and bax.","['Tormanen, U', 'Nuorva, K', 'Soini, Y', 'Paakko, P']","['Tormanen U', 'Nuorva K', 'Soini Y', 'Paakko P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bronchi/cytology/*pathology', 'Carcinoma in Situ/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Metaplasia', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Precancerous Conditions/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690159 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Feb;79(5-6):996-1002. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690159.,,PMC2362669,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in the expression of these proteins can contribute to the formation of cancer, as well as influence tumour response to chemo- and radiotherapy. We used antibodies specific for the human Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak and p53 proteins to examine the expression of these apoptosis-regulating genes in 49 archival specimens of patients with radically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumour cells containing immunostaining for the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were present in 31% and 58% of the cases evaluated, respectively, whereas immunopositivity for the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak was found in 47% and 58% of the samples. p53 immunopositivity was detected in 61% of the samples. The expression of Bcl-2 and p53 and the expression of Mcl-1 and Bax showed a positive association (P = 0.02 and P = 0.06 respectively), whereas the expression of Bax was inversely related to p53 (P = 0.008). The expression of Bcl-2 had a negative influence on relapse-free survival in this population of primary resected NSCLC patients (P = 0.02). The expression of p53 and Bcl-2 was significantly associated with metastasis-free survival (P < 0.01). Only patients with p53-positive tumours developed metastases during the follow-up period. Our results establish the frequent expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax and Bak in NSCLC.

The chemosensitivity of each drug was determined by a 3-day cell growth inhibition assay. Compared with epirubicin (EPI), IDA and MX2 were 17- and eightfold more effective in the CEM/A7R line respectively. No cross-resistance to 5-FU was seen in the CEM/A7R line. Verapamil (5 microM) and PSC 833 (1 microM), which dramatically reversed resistance to EPI in the CEM/A7R line, had no sensitizing effect on the resistance of this line to MX2, but slightly decreased resistance to IDA. The sensitivity to 5-FU was unchanged by these modulators. The induction of MDR1 mRNA expression by IDA, MX2 and 5-FU was analysed by Northern blotting and semiquantitatively assessed by scanning Northern blots on a phosphorimager. The relative level of MDR1 expression was expressed as a ratio of MDR1 mRNA to the internal RNA control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). IDA, MX2 and 5-FU differentially up-regulated MDR1 mRNA in the CEM/A7R line in a dose-dependent manner. Both IDA and MX2 induced MDR1 expression within 4 h. 5-FU up-regulated MDR1 expression only when drug exposure was prolonged to 24 h. Based on MRK 16 binding, flow cytometric analysis of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression paralleled the increase in MDR1 mRNA levels. For the three anthracyclines, the increase in MDR1 expression was stable in cells grown in the absence of drug for more than 3 weeks after drug treatment. The induction of MDR1 expression by 5-FU was transient, associated with a rapid decrease in the increased Pgp levels which returned to baseline 72 h after the removal of 5-FU. This study demonstrates that MDR1 expression can be induced by analogues of anthracyclines not pumped by Pgp, and that this induction appears to be stable despite a 3-week drug-free period.","['Hu, X F', 'Slater, A', 'Rischin, D', 'Kantharidis, P', 'Parkin, J D', 'Zalcberg, J']","['Hu XF', 'Slater A', 'Rischin D', 'Kantharidis P', 'Parkin JD', 'Zalcberg J']","['Trescowthick Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '105026-50-4 (morpholinoanthracycline MX2)', 'E7437K3983 (Carubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Carubicin/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690133 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Feb;79(5-6):831-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690133.,,PMC2362657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a tumour-selective reduction of the extracellular and intracellular pH and their effect on the tumour response of selected anti-cancer drugs. In an in vitro L1210 leukaemic cell model, we confirmed enhanced cytotoxicity of chlorambucil at low extracellular pH conditions. In contrast, the alkylating drugs melphalan and cisplatin, and bioreductive agents mitomycin C and its derivative EO9, required low intracellular pH conditions for enhanced activation. Furthermore, a strong and pH-independent synergism was observed between the pH-equilibrating drug nigericin and melphalan, of which the mechanism is unclear. In radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) tumour-bearing mice, the extracellular pH was reduced by the mitochondrial inhibitor m-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) or its analogue benzylguanidine (BG) plus glucose. To simultaneously reduce the intracellular pH, MIBG plus glucose were combined with the ionophore nigericin or the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor amiloride and the Na+-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchanger inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS). Biochemical studies confirmed an effective reduction of the extracellular pH to approximately 6.2, and anti-tumour responses to the interventions indicated a simultaneous reduction of the intracellular pH below 6.6 for at least 3 h. Combined reduction of extra- and intracellular tumour pH with melphalan increased the tumour regrowth time to 200% of the pretreatment volume from 5.7 +/- 0.6 days for melphalan alone to 8.1 +/- 0.7 days with pH manipulation (P < 0.05). Mitomycin C related tumour growth delay was enhanced by the combined interventions from 3.8 +/- 0.5 to 5.2 +/- 0.5 days (P < 0.05), but only in tumours of relatively large sizes. The interventions were non-toxic alone or in combination with the anti-cancer drugs and did not affect melphalan biodistribution. In conclusion, we have developed non-toxic interventions for sustained and selective reduction of extra- and intracellular tumour pH which potentiated the tumour responses to selected anti-cancer drugs.","['Kuin, A', 'Aalders, M', 'Lamfers, M', 'van Zuidam, D J', 'Essers, M', 'Beijnen, J H', 'Smets, L A']","['Kuin A', 'Aalders M', 'Lamfers M', 'van Zuidam DJ', 'Essers M', 'Beijnen JH', 'Smets LA']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Guanidines)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '2211-57-6 (benzylguanidine)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)"", 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', ""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Amiloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/toxicity', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacokinetics', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Guanidines/*toxicity', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kidney/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Melphalan/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/10 00:00,1999/03/10 00:01,['1999/03/10 00:00'],"['1999/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690127 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Feb;79(5-6):793-801. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690127.,,PMC2362690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor; camptothecin, a topoisomerase I blocking drug; and tiazofurin, an inhibitor of inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), were used. Ultrastructural analysis showed morphologic changes characteristic of apoptosis that were very similar for all three agents. Nevertheless, DNA oligonucleosomic fragmentation was not detectable by agarose gel electrophoresis. However, a genomic DNA cleavage appeared after pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in cells treated with these agents for 24 h. Furthermore, in situ nick translation (NT) showed a finely spotted nuclear labelling in staurosporine-treated cells and a compact fluorescence after camptothecin incubation. In tiazofurin-treated cells an intermediate pattern was found. Therefore, apoptotic agents with different mechanisms of action induced the formation of large genomic DNA fragments and very similar ultrastructural changes.

EUROCARE Working Group.,2253-63,"Data on 73,070 patients for seven major haematological malignancies diagnosed in Europe between 1985 and 1989 from 39 population-based cancer registries in 17 countries are included in the EUROCARE database. Relative survival was analysed by country and age between 1985 and 1989 and time trends were analysed from 1978-1989 for 13 countries which collaborated in EUROCARE for this entire period. The European weighted age-standardised 5-year relative survival rate was 72% for patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD, ranging from 45 to 76% in 13 countries), 63% for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, range 51-79%, 14 countries), 46% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, range 25-63%, 17 countries), 31% for patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML, range 8-40%, 13 countries), 28% for patients with multiple myeloma (MM, range 18-36%, 14 countries), 25% for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, range 19-33%, 7 countries) and 10% for patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML, range 4-15%, 11 countries). In all countries, relative survival declined with age, most markedly for patients with acute leukaemias. Patients in Northern and Western Europe had better survival rates, particularly in younger patients (15-45 years of age), whilst those in Eastern European countries tended to have poorer rates. Compared with 1978-1979, relative 5-year survival improved in 1987-1989 for most haematological malignancies (relative risk (RR) of death for CLL 0.65, AML 0.75, HD 0.76, ALL 0.79, NHL 0.82), with only CML (RR 0.95) and MM (RR 1.00) showing little or no change. These results suggest that generally and particularly in Eastern Europe there is room for improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of haematological malignancies.

LIF and OSM increased collagenase-3 (MMP-13) mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. LIF and OSM enhanced the rate of transcription of the collagenase gene and stabilized collagenase mRNA in transcriptionally arrested cells.

Briefly, bone marrow is aspirated through a medium containing theophyllin, prostaglandin-E1 and other antiaggregant agents. Megakaryocytes-enriched buffy coats are recovered. Megakaryocytes are then stained for GP IIIa coupled with FITC and for DNA (propidium iodide). A Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer is used for measuring the ploidy distribution of GP IIIa positive cells. The method we developed presents several advantages. Firstly, the time required is greatly decreased in comparison with other studies. Secondly, the washing steps are limited in number allowing a diminution of the cell loss. Thirdly, the method ensures a better megakaryocyte preservation. Finally, selection of megakaryocytes by ploidy and expression of GP IIIa can be made easily because of the simultaneity of the two stainings as well as by the use of a precise gating on the flow cytometer. Based on these results, we conclude that the present method provides a better means for the isolation and analysis of human normal megakaryocytes. This technique has been applied to the analysis of megakaryocyte populations from patients with abnormal platelet counts. In chronic myeloid leukemia patients, analysis of ploidy distribution shows a shift toward the low ploidy while in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia the ploidy distributions are shifted toward the high ploidy.","['Baatout, S', 'Chatelain, B', 'Staquet, P', 'Symann, M', 'Chatelain, C']","['Baatout S', 'Chatelain B', 'Staquet P', 'Symann M', 'Chatelain C']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, Oncology Unit, UCL, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3', 'Male', '*Megakaryocytes', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', '*Ploidies']",,1999/03/09 00:00,1999/03/09 00:01,['1999/03/09 00:00'],"['1999/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1998;29(3):213-28.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied surface marker profiles and cloning capability of bone marrow (BM) cells from 22 adult ALL-patients at diagnosis (n = 15) or relapse (n = 7) in agar cultures under different culture conditions in order to develop a screening system for the classification of ALL and the detection of residual leukemia. Immunophenotyping of those 22 BM-samples enabled a classification in B- or T-linear ALL. Colony growth of BM-cells could be obtained in four out of 20 cases of ALL at diagnosis and in one case at relapse. Different stimulating factors and their combinations (GM-CSF; IL-1; IL-2; IL-3; IL-4; IL-6; placenta conditioned media (PCM); Phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 40%) and lipopolisaccaride (LPS, 1.25%)--containing conditioned media ('B-ly'); IL-1+IL-3; IL-1+IL-4; IL-1+IL-6; IL-1+B-ly) did not show an overall significant difference in stimulating ALL-clones. Immunological phenotyping of ALL-clones in these 5 cases could prove the lymphoid leukemic character of the clones obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that colony growth of ALL-BM-cells is difficult.

In this disease p53, p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p57KIP2 mutations and p15INK4B/p16INK4A homo/hemizygous deletions were analyzed in the initial diagnosis phase and during the treatment phase of twelve CML cases, in order to establish whether there was a consistent molecular genetic alteration in its progression. During the treatment period, four of twelve cases had blastic crisis. All the mutations observed in p53, p16INK4A and p15INK4B cumulated in three out of four CML cases who had blastic crises. In one case, p53 codon 282 mutation (CGG-->TGG; arg-->trp) were observed in initial diagnosis. Seven months later, G-->C transition in the 3' side of p15 cDNA (778. nucleotide) was observed in the accelerated phase with the same p53 codon 282 mutation. Thirteen months later, this patient died as a result of blastic crisis. The patient in blastic crises in the initial diagnosis phase had a mis-sense point mutation in p16 codon 69 (ACT-->AGT; thr-->ser) and a polymorphism in codon 68 (GCC-->GCG). Six months later, this patient also died. In one case, p53 codon 237 mutation (ATG-->ATA; met-->ile) were observed in the initial diagnosis phase.

These results indicate that p15INK4B and p16INK4A gene alterations may have an affect on the progression of CML-like p53 mutation. A correlation was found with the progression of CML and p53, p15INK4B and p16INK4A somatic mutations.

In contrast to DNA replication, RNA synthesis (transcription) and protein synthesis (mRNA translation) were not affected by 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-adenine. The ribonucleoside triphosphate pools were slightly elevated, while the intracellular levels of all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were 1.5-4-fold increased in 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine-treated K562, CEM and L1210 cells. The effect of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine on de novo (thymidylate synthase-mediated) and salvage (thymidine kinase-mediated) dTTP synthesis was investigated using radio-labelled nucleoside precursors. The amount of thymidylate synthase-derived dTTP in the acid soluble pool was 2-4-fold higher in PMEA-treated than in untreated K562 cells, which is in accord with the 3-4-fold expansion of the global dTTP level in the presence of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine. Strikingly, 2-derived dTTP accumulated to a much higher extent (i.e. 16-40-fold) in the soluble dTTP pool upon 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine treatment. In keeping with this finding, a markedly increased thymidine kinase activity could be demonstrated in extracts of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine-treated K562 cell cultures. Also, in the presence of 200 microM 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, 14-fold less thymidylate synthase-derived but only 3-fold less thymidine kinase-derived dTTP was incorporated into the DNA of the K562 cells. These data show that thymidine incorporation may be inappropriate as a cell proliferation marker in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors such as 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine. Our findings indicate that 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine causes a peculiar pattern of (deoxy)ribonucleotide metabolism deregulation in drug-treated tumor cells, as a result of the metabolic block imposed by the drug on the S phase of the cell cycle.","['Hatse, S', 'De Clercq, E', 'Balzarini, J']","['Hatse S', 'De Clercq E', 'Balzarini J']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '6GQP90I798 (adefovir)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', '*Organophosphonates', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotides/biosynthesis', 'S Phase', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/09 00:00,1999/03/09 00:01,['1999/03/09 00:00'],"['1999/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(99)00104-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00104-0 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Feb 19;445(1):92-7. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00104-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These conditions may be suggested by the clinical presentation, laboratory test values and peripheral blood smear, or by failure of the anemia to respond to iron supplements or nutrient replacement. The principal cause of the anemia of renal disease is a decreased production of red blood cells related to a relative deficiency of erythropoietin. When treatment is required, erythropoietin is administered, often with iron supplementation. In the anemia of chronic disease, impaired iron transport decreases red blood cell production. Treatment is predominantly directed at the underlying condition. Since iron stores are usually normal, iron administration is not beneficial. Thalassemia minor results from a congenital abnormality of hemoglobin synthesis. The disorder may masquerade as mild iron deficiency anemia, but iron therapy and transfusions are often not indicated. In the myelodysplastic syndrome, blood cell components fail to mature, and the condition may progress to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The rate of progression depends on the subtype of myelodysplasia, but the leukemia is usually resistant to therapy.","['Abramson, S D', 'Abramson, N']","['Abramson SD', 'Abramson N']","['University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am Fam Physician,American family physician,1272646,,IM,"['Anemia/blood/*etiology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/complications', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Thalassemia/complications']",16,1999/03/09 00:00,1999/03/09 00:01,['1999/03/09 00:00'],"['1999/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Fam Physician. 1999 Feb 15;59(4):851-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the ABL1 promoters (Pa) and the coding region of the gene are usually translocated intact to the BCR locus, but the translocated promoter appears to be silent in most cases. Recently, hypermethylation of Pa was demonstrated in CML and was proposed to mark advanced stages of the disease. To study this issue, we measured Pa methylation in CML using Southern blot analysis. Of 110 evaluable samples, 23 (21%) had no methylation, 17 (15%) had minimal (<15%) methylation, 12 (11%) had moderate methylation (15% to 25%), and 58 (53%) had high levels of methylation (>25%) at the ABL1 locus. High methylation was more frequent in advanced cases of CML. Among the 76 evaluable patients in early chronic phase (ECP), a major cytogenetic response with interferon-based therapy was observed in 14 of 34 patients with high methylation compared with 19 of 42 among the others (41% v 45%; P value not significant). At a median follow-up of 7 years, there was no significant difference in survival by ABL1 methylation category. Among patients who achieved a major cytogenetic response, low levels of methylation were associated with a trend towards improved survival, but this trend did not reach statistical significance. Thus, Pa methylation in CML is associated with disease progression but does not appear to predict for survival or response to interferon-based therapy.","['Issa, J P', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Mohan, A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Cortes, J', 'Pierce, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Issa JP', 'Kantarjian H', 'Mohan A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Pierce S', 'Talpaz M']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, USA. jpissa@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/03/09 00:00,1999/03/09 00:01,['1999/03/09 00:00'],"['1999/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48683-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 15;93(6):2075-80.,,,,,,['Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1141.

They exert their effects by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and/or retinoid X receptors (RXRs). We studied the effects of novel retinoids on proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 myeloid leukemic cells, as well as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells from patients. RXR-selective SR11345 (Retinoid C) had little ability to inhibit the clonal growth and to induce the differentiation of either HL-60 or NB4 cells. However, SR11276 (Retinoid E), which activated both the RAR and RXR classes, and SR11278 (Retinoid D), which activated the RAR subtypes alpha, beta, and gamma, could inhibit clonal growth of both cell types, as well as leukemic cells from APL patients. The combination of ATRA and either SR11276 or SR11278 additively inhibited APL cell proliferation. SR11302 (Retinoid A), with reported anti-AP-1 activity and no activation of RARs and RXR and SR11363 (Retinoid B), which selectively activated RARbeta and gamma, were inactive. The clonal proliferation of both HL-60 and NB4 cells that were pulse-exposed to 10(-9) mol/L ATRA, SR11276, SR11278, or SR11345 for 3 days, washed, and plated in methylcellulose culture were inhibited by 0%, 51%, 21%, and 1% for HL-60 cells and 43%, 41%, 35%, and 1% for NB4, respectively, compared with nontreated control cells. When the HL-60 cells were pulse-exposed to 10(-9) mol/L of either SR11278 or SR11276, plus 10(-9) mol/L ATRA for 3 days, colony numbers were reduced by 46% and 64%, respectively. Induction of leukemic cell differentiation as determined by the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay showed that the combination of 10(-7) mol/L of either SR11278 or SR11276 with 10(-7) mol/L ATRA had additive effects on HL-60 cells, NB4 cells, and fresh APL cells. Induction of CD11b expression on both HL-60 and NB4 cells occurs during their differentiation. Expression of this antigen was synergistically augmented by the combination of either 10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/L SR11278 or 10(-7) to 10(-9) mol/L SR11276 with 10(-9) mol/L ATRA compared with either analog alone in HL-60 cells. Expression of the novel myeloid specific transcription factor C/EBPepsilon was increased by SR11278 and SR11276 in both the HL-60 and NB4 cell lines. We conclude that retinoids or combination of retinoids with specificities for both RAR and RXR may markedly enhance the ability of ATRA to inhibit clonal growth and induce differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 leukemic cells.

However, because N-ras has not been shown to induce these disorders in an in vivo model, the role of N-ras in the evolution of myeloid leukemia is unclear. To investigate the potential of N-ras to induce myeloid leukemia, lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) cells infected with a retroviral vector carrying activated N-ras. Approximately 60% of these mice developed hematopoietic disorders, including severe MPDs resembling human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or AML with differentiation (French-American-British [FAB] classification M2). Other reconstituted mice succumbed to hematopoietic defects that were pathologically similar to human MDSs. The latter disorders appeared to be due to a myeloid impairment that was demonstrated by enumeration of day-12 colony-forming units-spleen (CFU-S) and by in vitro colony assays. A high level of apoptosis associated with thymic atrophy and peripheral blood (PB) lymphopenia was also evident in N-ras reconstituted mice. Our results are consistent with a model in which antiproliferative effects are a primary consequence of N-ras mutations and secondary transforming events are necessary for the development of myeloid leukemia. This is the first report of an in vivo model for N-ras induced MPD and leukemia.","['MacKenzie, K L', 'Dolnikov, A', 'Millington, M', 'Shounan, Y', 'Symonds, G']","['MacKenzie KL', 'Dolnikov A', 'Millington M', 'Shounan Y', 'Symonds G']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacology St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, ras', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', '*Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', '*Transfection', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1999/03/09 00:00,1999/03/09 00:01,['1999/03/09 00:00'],"['1999/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48680-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 15;93(6):2043-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because this T-cell anergy against B-CLL cells may be caused by the inability of B-CLL cells to present tumor-antigens efficiently, we examined the possibility of upregulating critical costimulatory (B7-1 and B7-2) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and LFA-3) on B-CLL cells to improve antigen presentation. The stimulation of B-CLL cells via CD40 by culture on CD40L expressing feeder cells induced a strong upregulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecules and turned the B-CLL cells into efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD40-activated B-CLL (CD40-CLL) cells stimulated the proliferation of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, stimulation of allogeneic versus autologous T cells resulted in the expansion of different effector populations. Allogeneic CD40-CLL cells allowed for the expansion of specific CD8(+) cytolytic T cells (CTL). In marked contrast, autologous CD40-CLL cells did not induce a relevant CTL response, but rather stimulated a CD4(+), Th1-like T-cell population that expressed high levels of CD40L and released interferon-gamma in response to stimulation by CD40-CLL cells. Together, these results support the view that CD40 activation of B-CLL cells might reverse T-cell anergy against the neoplastic cell clone, although the character of the immune response depends on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) background on which the CLL or tumor antigens are presented. These findings may have important implications for the design of cellular immunotherapies for B-CLL.","['Buhmann, R', 'Nolte, A', 'Westhaus, D', 'Emmerich, B', 'Hallek, M']","['Buhmann R', 'Nolte A', 'Westhaus D', 'Emmerich B', 'Hallek M']","['Laboratorium fur Molekulare Biologie, Genzentrum, Medizinische Klinik, Grobetahadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (CD40 Antigens)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/09 00:00,1999/03/09 00:01,['1999/03/09 00:00'],"['1999/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48674-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 15;93(6):1992-2002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the regions within the cytoplasmic domain of LIFR that generate the signals for growth arrest, macrophage differentiation, and STAT3 activation independently of gp130, we constructed chimeric receptors by linking the transmembrane and intracellular regions of mouse LIFR to the extracellular domains of the human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (hGM-CSFR) alpha and betac chains. Using the full-length cytoplasmic domain and mutants with progressive C-terminal truncations or point mutations, we show that the two membrane-distal tyrosines with the YXXQ motif of LIFR are critical not only for STAT3 activation, but also for growth arrest and differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells. A truncated STAT3, which acts in a dominant negative manner was introduced into WEHI-3B D+ cells expressing GM-CSFRalpha-LIFR and GM-CSFRbetac-LIFR.

SHIP is phosphorylated on tyrosine after receptor binding by several cytokines and has a negative role in hematopoiesis. We cloned a murine complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence for an isoform of SHIP with an internal 183 nucleotide deletion, encoding a protein 61 amino acids shorter than 145 kD SHIP. This deletion eliminates potential SH3-domain binding regions and a potential binding site for the p85 subunit of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase. Using polyclonal anti-SHIP antibodies, we and others have previously observed a 135 kD SHIP isoform that is coexpressed with 145 kD SHIP. Here, we used monoclonal antibodies raised against the region deleted in the spliced form to show that the product of the novel spliced SHIP cDNA is antigenically identical to the 135 kD SHIP isoform. Like 145 kD SHIP, 135 kD SHIP expression was induced on differentiation of bone marrow cells. After macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) stimulation of FDC-P1(Fms) myeloid cells, both 145 and 135 kD SHIP forms were tyrosine phosphorylated and could be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies to Shc and Grb2.

In the present study, we investigated the expression of members of the IL-6 supergene family and related cytokines and the potential role of IL-6 in prostate cancer growth regulation. METHODS: Five established human prostate cancer cell lines were screened by ELISA for production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M (OSM), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Expression of the ligand-binding component of the IL-6 receptor, IL-6Rp80, was evaluated by ELISA and RT-PCR. Sequential immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to assay for expression of the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor, gp130. The effects of IL-6 on cell growth were assessed by MTT assays. RESULTS: The three hormone-refractory cell lines, DU-145, TSU, and PC-3, secreted distinct combinations of cytokines (DU-145: IL-6, GM-CSF; TSU: IL-6, LIF; PC-3: IL-6, G-CSF, LIF, IL-1, GM-CSF), each uniformly expressing IL-6. In contrast, neither of the two hormone-dependent cell lines, LNCaP-ATCC and LNCaP-GW, secreted significant quantities of any of the cytokines analyzed. None of the cell lines secreted detectable quantities of OSM, CNTF, or TNF. All cell lines, irrespective of hormone status, expressed both Il-6Rp80 and gp130.

This essay in his honor suggests that the cell kill concept of chemotherapy of acute myeloblastic leukemia be extended to include two additional ideas. The first concept is that leukemic blasts, like normal hemopoietic cells, are organized in hierarchies, headed by stem cells. In both normal and leukemic hemopoiesis, killing stem cells will destroy the system; furthermore, both normal and leukemic cells respond to regulators. It follows that acute myelogenous leukemia should be considered as a dependent neoplasm. The second concept is that cell/drug interaction should be considered as two phases. The first, or proximal phase, consists of the events that lead up to injury; the second, or distal phase, comprises the responses of the cell that contribute to either progression to apoptosis or recovery. Distal responses are described briefly. Regulated drug sensitivity is presented as an example of how distal responses might be used to improve treatment.","['McCulloch, E A']",['McCulloch EA'],"['The Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, M5G 2M9 Canada.']",['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Death', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Oncogenes', 'Probability', 'Stem Cells/*pathology']",81,1999/03/06 00:00,1999/03/06 00:01,['1999/03/06 00:00'],"['1999/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Dec;3(12 Pt 2):2676-81.,,,,,,,,,,['Freireich EJ'],"['Freireich, E J']",,,,,,

With a median follow-up of 30.5 months (range, 5-60 months), 25 patients are alive in continuous complete remission. Estimated disease-free survival at 5 years is 80.5%. Death was due to transplant-related toxicity (graft-versus-host disease and cytomegalovirus infection, graft-versus-host disease and pneumonia, sepsis and mucositis, respectively). None of the patients have relapsed. As demonstrated by the results of this analysis, the conditioning regimen busulfan/cyclophosphamide/etoposide is effective and well tolerated in patients with AML in first complete remission. Main nonhematological toxicities were mucositis and hepatotoxicity. The low mortality and relapse rate appears to justify allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for patients with AML in first complete remission who have an HLA-identical donor.

Only in the mid-1980s did investigation begin to consider complete remission (CR) a research objective, representing a necessary first step toward cure. The experience with autologous and allogeneic stem cell-supported high-dose therapy is reviewed, demonstrating, in both historically controlled and randomized studies, the validity of the dose-response concept in MM in terms of increased CR rates as well as extended event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Avoidance of hematopoietic stem cell-damaging agents, especially melphalan, nitrosoureas, and ionizing radiation to marrow-containing sites, assures the ability of peripheral stem cell collection of high quality and quantity, providing rapid engraftment so that mortality is well under 5% following high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m2). This treatment can be applied safely to patients even >70 years of age and in the presence of renal failure. Tandem autotransplants after multiregimen induction have yielded CR rates in the 40% range with median durations of EFS and OS of 43 and 62 months, respectively. Certain chromosomal abnormalities (11 and 13; and translocations) represent the dominant adverse prognosticator for EFS and OS, confirmed in over 500 patients including those with prior therapy. Allogeneic transplants, possible in less than 10% of MM patients, are associated with a 50% mortality during the first year and, unfortunately, late relapses; thus, this approach should be reserved for patients with high-risk disease early in their management. A risk-based treatment algorithm that matches a patient's disease risk with the risk of intervention is presently used, followed by bisphosphonate therapy, not only to delay the onset of MM-related bone disease but also to induce tumor cell apoptosis, indirectly or directly, by down-regulation of cytokines with antiapoptotic activities.

In this study, we used decision tree induction as an information processing system for the analysis of flow cytometry immunophenotype results of bone marrow specimens obtained for the diagnosis of acute leukemia. By using decision tree analysis, we queried which antibodies and at what percentage cut-offs led to particular diagnoses. Flow cytometry results of up to 27 monoclonal antibodies from bone marrow specimens of 175 adult and pediatric cases were used: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 80), myeloid leukemia (n = 44), mixed lineage (n = 16), and reactive marrow (n = 35). The percentage of positive cells was used as input data, and the diagnoses were used as output of the information processing system. Results of the decision tree showed an easy, accurate, and intuitive algorithm that can delineate a hierarchy of antibodies relevant to diagnosis. A correct discrimination of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia from benign bone marrow can be inferred by using the results of four to eight from a panel of up to 27 antibodies with an accuracy of 95%. Here, we describe a computer-aided model that uses decision tree induction applied to flow cytometry immunophenotype data.

Our earlier studies established that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) uptake. Studies now have been carried out to determine which type of Na/Pi transporter (Pit-1 or Pit-2) is regulated by PKC and which PKC isotypes are involved in the up-regulation of Na/Pi uptake by the Na/Pi transporter/viral receptor. It was found that the activation of short term (2-min) Na/Pi uptake by PMA is abolished when cells are infected with amphotropic murine retrovirus (binds Pit-2 receptor) but not with gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus (binds Pit-1 receptor), indicating that Pit-2 is the form of Na/Pi transporter/viral receptor regulated by PKC. The PKC-mediated activation of Pit-2 was blocked by pretreating cells with the pan-PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide but not with the conventional PKC isotype inhibitor Go 6976, suggesting that a novel PKC isotype is required to regulate Pit-2. Overexpression of PKCepsilon, but not of PKCalpha, -delta, or -zeta, was found to mimic the activation of Na/Pi uptake. To further establish that PKCepsilon is involved in the regulation of Pit-2, cells were treated with PKCepsilon-selective antisense oligonucleotides. Treatment with PKCepsilon antisense oligonucleotides decreased the PMA-induced activation of Na/Pi uptake. These results indicate that PMA-induced stimulation of Na/Pi uptake by Pit-2 is specifically mediated through activation of PKCepsilon.","['Jobbagy, Z', 'Olah, Z', 'Petrovics, G', 'Eiden, M V', 'Leverett, B D', 'Dean, N M', 'Anderson, W B']","['Jobbagy Z', 'Olah Z', 'Petrovics G', 'Eiden MV', 'Leverett BD', 'Dean NM', 'Anderson WB']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Prkce protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Up-Regulation']",,1999/03/06 00:00,1999/03/06 00:01,['1999/03/06 00:00'],"['1999/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.11.7067 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36974-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Mar 12;274(11):7067-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.11.7067.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a 100% concordance when the p26 fusion protein was used in the Western blot. However, the Western blot using the tTM fusion protein as its test antigen identified four BIV-positive bovine sera which had tested negative in both the p26 recombinant-protein-based and the reference Western blot assays. This resulted in the lower concordance of 96.2% between the tTM-protein-based and reference Western blot assays.

Hemic neoplasia (HN) is endemic to mussel populations in Puget Sound. The prevalence of hemic neoplasia ranged from 0 to 30% in mussels from nine sites in Puget Sound, Washington. Organic chemical contamination in sediment from these sites range from 0.1 to 64.0 ppm of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 0.07 to 0.50 ppm chlorinated hydrocarbons. No relationship between the body burden of environmental contaminants and the prevalence of HN in mussels was identified. To evaluate the short-term ability of chemical contaminants to induce HN in mussels, mussels, from a site where mussels were previously determined to be HN free, were fed microencapsulated PAHs (composed of a mixture of phenanthrene, flouranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene) or PCBs (Aroclor 1254) and the prevalence of HN was assessed after 30 days of exposure. Although an apparent increase in HN prevalence (20 to 30%) was observed in all treatments groups except the untreated controls, no significant difference in the prevalence of HN was observed between the control group of mussels fed corn oil (vehicle) and mussels fed either PAHs or PCBs in corn oil. A long-term (180-day) exposure study was conducted to evaluate the influence of PAHs or PCBs in modulating the prevalence of HN in a mussel population already exhibiting a moderate HN prevalence. Mussels, from a site where mussels were previously determined to exhibit a background prevalence of HN, fed microencapsulated PAHs, PCBs, and corn oil (vehicle) over a long time period (180 days), revealed an apparent increased prevalence of HN (30 to 40%) above the low levels (20%) initially present. However, no significant difference in the prevalence of HN was observed between the control group of mussels fed corn oil (vehicle) and mussels fed either PAHs or PCBs in corn oil.

Incubation of U937 cells with 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine or the etoposide VP-16 was accompanied by growth arrest in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and an accumulation of a population in the sub-G1 phase which exhibited characteristics typical for the apoptotic pathway. In contrast, human TUR leukemia cells demonstrated no significant effects after a similar treatment with Ara-C and VP-16. Thus, TUR cells continued to proliferate in the presence of these anti-cancer drugs and the number of apoptotic cells as evaluated by propidium iodide staining and the detection of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was significantly reduced when compared to the parental U937 cells. Similar effects were observed upon serum-starvation demonstrating resistance to apoptosis in TUR cells. Whereas induction of apoptosis is regulated by a network of distinct factors including the activation of proteolytically active caspases, we investigated these pathways in both cell lines. U937 cells demonstrated activation of the 32-kDa caspase-3 upon drug treatment by cleavage into the 20-kDa activated form. However, there was no 20-kDa caspase-3 fragment detectable in TUR cells. Simultaneously, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was significantly increased in drug-treated U937 cells as measured in vitro by enhanced metabolization of a fluorescence substrate and in vivo by cleavage of an appropriate substrate for caspase-3, namely, protein kinase Cdelta. In contrast, there was little if any caspase-3 activation detectable in drug-treated TUR cells. Taken together, these data suggest a signaling defect in the activation of the caspase-3 proteolytic system in TUR cells upon treatment with chemotherapeutic compounds which is associated with resistance to apoptosis in these human leukemia cells.","['Meinhardt, G', 'Roth, J', 'Totok, G', 'Auner, H', 'Emmerich, B', 'Hass, R']","['Meinhardt G', 'Roth J', 'Totok G', 'Auner H', 'Emmerich B', 'Hass R']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.

However, a control cell line derived from a nontransgenic C57BL/6 mouse did not form foci in vitro or tumors in vivo, indicating that Tax was required for the transformation process. Results of Northern analyses showed that the T9 cells and the highly malignant derivatives of T6 cells expressed elevated levels of c-myc mRNA. These findings suggest that progression of the tax-transgenic cells toward a more malignant phenotype might involve c-myc deregulation.","['Saggioro, D', ""D'agostino, D M"", 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Saggioro D', ""D'agostino DM"", 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences-Oncology Section, Interuniversity Center for Cancer Research, University of Padova, Padova, 35128, Italy. saggioro@ux1.unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,1999/03/06 00:00,1999/03/06 00:01,['1999/03/06 00:00'],"['1999/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94381-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4381 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Mar 15;247(2):525-33. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4381.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecules that regulate this important regressive process remain largely unknown. Our data indicate that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) cause sympathetic neurons to retract their dendrites in vitro, ultimately leading to an approximately 80% reduction in the size of the arbor. The dendritic retraction induced by LIF exhibited substantial specificity because it was not accompanied by changes in cell number, in the rate of axonal growth, or in the expression of axonal cytoskeletal elements. An antibody to gp130 blocked the effects of LIF and CNTF, and both cytokines induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of stat3. Moreover, addition of soluble interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor to the medium endowed IL-6 with the ability to cause dendritic regression. These data indicate that ligands activating the gp130 pathway have the ability to profoundly alter neuronal cell shape and polarity by selectively causing the retraction of dendrites.","['Guo, X', 'Chandrasekaran, V', 'Lein, P', 'Kaplan, P L', 'Higgins, D']","['Guo X', 'Chandrasekaran V', 'Lein P', 'Kaplan PL', 'Higgins D']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dendrites/*drug effects/physiology', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/cytology/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/*drug effects/physiology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,1999/03/05 00:00,1999/03/05 00:01,['1999/03/05 00:00'],"['1999/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1999 Mar 15;19(6):2113-21.,,PMC6782564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are, however, abused in some circumstances and are not without risk. The use of platelet transfusions to prevent rather than to treat bleeding in children with malignant disease has increased several times over the last two decades. When joining in this widespread practice, physicians should be aware that there is a relatively unimpressive evidence base supporting it and also that for patients with uncomplicated myelo-suppression the most persuasive studies suggest that a threshold platelet count of 10 x 10(9)/L is no less effective than the more customary 20 x 10(9)/L is. Still lower thresholds await evaluation. For children with nonmalignant conditions the use of platelet transfusions should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but they should normally be avoided in the absence of clinically important bleeding. Neonates with thrombocytopenia, particularly those with immune disease due to a maternal alloantibody, are considered an exception to this generalization. The serious hazards of platelet transfusions include alloimmunization and the induction of refractoriness, graft-versus-host (GVH) disease, and the transmission of infection, all of which can be life threatening. Less risky alternative therapeutic approaches may become more widely available in the future, including recombinant thrombopoietin and lyophilized heat-treated platelet membrane preparations.","['Cahill, M R', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Cahill MR', 'Lilleyman JS']","['Regional General Hospital, Dooradoyle, Limerick, Republic of Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",95,1999/03/05 00:00,1999/03/05 00:01,['1999/03/05 00:00'],"['1999/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-996056 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 1998;24(6):567-75. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-996056.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a high rate of spontaneous remission. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is extremely rare; the risk is higher during the chronic phase and in children with additional risk factors. The threshold platelet count in ITP is not known because of problems with platelet counting in thrombocytopenia and the lack of clinical data. The threshold is probably lower than in leukemia, because primary hemostasis is better in ITP.

Here we report that only the combination of v-abl and bcl2 was successful. Splenic B cells from beta galactosidase-immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide and dextran sulphate for 48 h and co-infected with ecotropic A-MuLV (v-abl) and amphotropic pZip-bcl2 (human bcl2) viruses. When inoculated i.p. into naive pristane-primed mice, these B cells generated mesenteric lymphadenopathy, intraperitoneal lymph nodules and ascites in 100% (8/8) of the mice within 36-53 days. The ascites fluid contained 69.5-122 microg/ml IgG and 2.5-13 microg/ml IgM against the immunogen. The ascites cells were passed intraperitoneally up to three times. In all passages, ascites tumors were generated, and the ascites fluid contained beta galactosidase-specific IgG and IgM, indicating that some immunoglobulin secreting B cells had been immortalized. Neither ascites nor tumors were produced when B cells infected with only one of the viruses was injected into the mice. The presence of each oncogene in ascites cells was verified by immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR. This study provides evidence for the cooperativity of an unexpected pair of oncogenes in B cell immortalization.","['Kumar, A', 'Ta, D', 'Henderson, D', 'Mushinski, J F', 'Reed, J C', 'Kuus-Reichel, K', 'Saedi, M S']","['Kumar A', 'Ta D', 'Henderson D', 'Mushinski JF', 'Reed JC', 'Kuus-Reichel K', 'Saedi MS']","['Hybritech Incorporated, San Diego, CA 92196, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/*genetics', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Genes, abl/*immunology', 'Genes, bcl-2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/immunology']",,1999/03/05 00:00,1999/03/05 00:01,['1999/03/05 00:00'],"['1999/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(98)00085-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(98)00085-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1999 Feb;65(3):153-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(98)00085-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of mice with IL-12 around the time of infection results in DC with normal stimulatory function (N.J. Williams, J.J. Harvey, I. Duncan, R.F.G. Booth, S.C. Knight, Cell Immunol. 183 (1988) 121-130). Here we derived DC from mouse bone marrow by culture with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) for 10-12 days; DC were generated from bone marrow cells taken from normal mice, from mice injected 15 days earlier with RLV or from those receiving RLV plus five daily doses of 100 ng of IL-12 starting 2 days before infection. Infection of the DC with RLV was assessed from nested PCR with doubling dilutions of DNA and the capacity of DC to stimulate a MLR was tested. DC derived from bone marrow of IL-12 treated animals showed at least twice the level of infection with RLV as those from non-treated animals although infection never exceeded 20% of the cells. DC derived from bone marrow of mice given RLV caused negligible stimulation of the MLR but those from mice additionally treated with IL-12 functioned normally. Thus, treatment of mice with IL-12 promoted the potential of stem cells taken 12 days after the last IL-12 injection to develop into functional DC despite increased infection with virus. Treatment of mice with IL-12 may have a long term effect on the potential growth of DC from stem cells which may contribute to the potency of this cytokine in promoting cell mediated immune responses.","['Kelleher, P', 'Williams, N J', 'Knight, S C']","['Kelleher P', 'Williams NJ', 'Knight SC']","['Imperial College School of Medicine, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, Harrow, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-12/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Rauscher Virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy/immunology']",,1999/03/05 00:00,1999/03/05 00:01,['1999/03/05 00:00'],"['1999/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(98)00124-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(98)00124-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1999 Jan;65(1-2):51-4. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(98)00124-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The JALSG AML 92 study for APL with all-trans retinoic acid resulted in a 89% CR rate in 196 and 64% 4-year DFS in CR cases. Hydroxycarbamide is can control the WBC in CML. This agent is also effective for other myeloproliferative disorders, such as acute leukemia and MDS. Oral administration of 50 mg etoposide daily showed a good outcome in old patients with malignant lymphoma. For old patients and those with refractory hematological malignancies, oral administration of these agents can offer a new form of palliative therapy to allow them to remain at home while maintaining a high quality of life.","['Ohnishi, K']",['Ohnishi K'],"['Dept. of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In CD14 transfected 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocyte tumor cells, these responses include activation of the MAP kinase homolog, p38, activation of NF-kappaB, and transcription of kappa light chains, leading to the assembly of surface IgM. In this work, we explored the specificity of the response with regard to lipid structure, and the requirement for p38 kinase activity prior to NF-kappaB activation in control and CD14 transfected 70Z/3 (CD14-70Z/3) cells. A p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, was used to block p38 kinase activity in cells. CD14-70Z/3 cells were incubated with 1-50 microM SB203580, and then stimulated with LPS. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and NF-kappaB activation was measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. SB203580 did not inhibit LPS induced NF-kappaB activation. In addition, LPS failed to activate p38 tyrosine phosphorylation in 70Z/3 cells lacking CD14, in spite of rapid NF-kappaB activation and robust surface IgM production with appropriate higher doses of LPS. LPS stimulation of p38 phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and surface IgM expression were all blocked completely by lipid A-like endotoxin antagonists whether or not CD14 was present. Acidic glycerophospholipids and ceramides did not mimic lipid A-like molecules either as agonists or antagonists in this system. Our data support the hypothesis that lipid A-mediated activation of cells requires stimulation of a putative lipid A sensor that is downstream of CD14, but upstream of p38 and NF-kappaB.","['Garrett, T A', 'Rosser, M F', 'Raetz, C R']","['Garrett TA', 'Rosser MF', 'Raetz CR']","['Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycerophospholipids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycerophospholipids/pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lipid A/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,1999/03/05 00:00,1999/03/05 00:01,['1999/03/05 00:00'],"['1999/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1388-1981(99)00014-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s1388-1981(99)00014-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Feb 25;1437(2):246-56. doi: 10.1016/s1388-1981(99)00014-1.,"['GM-51796/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07184-23/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects of coagulation may be important in the pathogenesis of ON. This study evaluated the prevalence of factor V Leiden (FVL, 1691G-->A), the most common inherited thrombophilic state, the prothrombin 20210G-->A polymorphism, and the thermolabile methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, 677C-->T) variant in a group of children in whom ON developed during or after treatment for cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Children in whom ON developed during cancer treatment at St Jude Children's Research Hospital were studied (n = 24). Genomic DNA was isolated, and polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the FVL, prothrombin 20210, and thermolabile MTHFR mutations. RESULTS: Sixteen of 24 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The mean age at ON diagnosis was 14.4 +/- 3. 7 years. The mean interval between cancer diagnosis and ON diagnosis was 27 +/- 21 months. Twenty-two patients had received steroids for a mean duration of 24 +/- 15 weeks before having development of ON. No patient had a history of thrombosis. Five (21%) patients had a family history of thrombosis. Genetic analysis revealed 0 (0%) of 24 FVL, 1 (4.5%) of 22 prothrombin 20210, and 3 (13.6%) of 22 thermolabile MTHFR. None of these mutation frequencies was significantly different from our control frequencies or published values. CONCLUSIONS: Although procoagulant abnormalities in general and FVL in particular have been detected in a significant number of patients with ON of the jaw and Legg-Perthes disease, we did not identify an increased prevalence of FVL or other hypercoagulable state mutations in a cohort of children with ON that developed during or after treatment for a variety of cancers.","['Kechli, A M', 'Wilimas, J A', 'Pui, C H', 'Park, V M', 'Tonkel, S', 'Deitcher, S R']","['Kechli AM', 'Wilimas JA', 'Pui CH', 'Park VM', 'Tonkel S', 'Deitcher SR']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, The University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (factor V Leiden)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'DNA/blood/genetics', 'Factor V/*analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood/complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteonecrosis/*blood/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Thrombophilia/*blood/epidemiology/etiology/genetics']",,1999/03/04 00:00,1999/03/04 00:01,['1999/03/04 00:00'],"['1999/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(99)70455-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(99)70455-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1999 Mar;134(3):310-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(99)70455-5.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients benefiting the most from fluconazole prophylaxis included those with acute myeloid leukemia who were undergoing induction therapy with cytarabine plus anthracycline-based regimens and those receiving marrow autografts not supported with hematopoietic growth factors.

This study of survivors of AML is the largest to date comparing the late effects of patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) with or without irradiation (RT) or CT followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PROCEDURE: In a retrospective review of 228 patients with AML or MDS from 1970 to 1995, 62 survived and had follow-up data available more than 1 year following completion of therapy. Ten patients with Down syndrome were excluded. Twenty-six received CT and 26 underwent BMT. Weight and height Z scores, endocrine, ophthalmologic, renal, and cardiac function following CT +/- RT or BMT +/- total body irradiation (TBI) were compared at a mean follow-up of 7.4 and 5.6 years, respectively. RESULTS: Both groups experienced a decrement in height and increase in weight. The mean height Z score in the CT group fell from -0.29 to -0.72 (P = 0.02) and mean weight Z score rose from -0.06 at diagnosis (T0) to 0.51 at last follow-up (T2) (P = 0.02), a finding no longer significant when patients who received RT were excluded. The mean height Z score in the BMT group fell from -0.17 at TO to -0.65 at T2 (P = 0.02), while the mean weight rose from 0.29 at T0 to 0.84 at T2, (P = 0.07). Six of 9 BMT adolescent girls experienced ovarian failure versus 0 of 11 girls treated with CT (P = 0.002). Seven adolescent CT males and seven BMT males showed normal pubertal progression. Two BMT patients require thyroid hormone supplementation, and one receives growth hormone. Six BMT patients and one CT patient developed cataracts, all of whom received irradiation (P = 0.10). Serum creatinine level, hypertension, or left ventricular shortening fraction were not different in the two groups. One BMT patient has chronic graft versus host disease. CONCLUSIONS: Growth, renal, and cardiac functions were similar in the two groups. The need for estrogen supplementation was more frequent following BMT. Recommendations concerning therapy for AML should depend on the probability of cure.","['Leahey, A M', 'Teunissen, H', 'Friedman, D L', 'Moshang, T', 'Lange, B J', 'Meadows, A T']","['Leahey AM', 'Teunissen H', 'Friedman DL', 'Moshang T', 'Lange BJ', 'Meadows AT']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, 19104, USA. leahey@kermit.oncol.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cataract/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Heart/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/03/04 03:39,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/04 03:39'],"['1999/03/04 03:39 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/04 03:39 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199903)32:3<163::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199903)32:3<163::aid-mpo1>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Mar;32(3):163-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199903)32:3<163::aid-mpo1>3.0.co;2-#.,['3 MO1 RR00240-32S9/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, unlike the wild-type mice, CD40-deficient mice do not develop symptoms of immunodeficiency, lymphoproliferative disease and the typical histological changes in the lymphoid tissue. These results show that the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction in vivo is essential for anergy induction and the subsequent development of immunodeficiency and pathologic expansion of lymphocytes. Infected CD40-deficient mice and their littermates express a similar pattern of cytokine mRNA, which is not biased towards a Th2 phenotype.

These studies were designed to test if leukotoxin causes release of the cytoskeletal protein, actin, from bovine leukemia cells and if purified actin-influenced bacterial growth or leukotoxin production. Culture supernatants caused a 7-fold decrease in viability of bovine leukemia cells and increased cell permeability that was accompanied by release of beta-actin into the cell culture supernatant. Exposing P. haemolytica to purified actin solutions induced the conversion of monomeric G-actin to polymerized F-actin. This conversion was partially inhibited by bovine P. haemolytica immune, but not pre-immune, serum. Loss of streptomycin resistance following treatment of the organism with acridine orange ablated the polymerizing activity. Incubation of P. haemolytica in the presence of purified F-actin did not affect growth but resulted in culture supernatant that had 3.0-3.9-fold greater leukotoxicity compared to medium alone or medium containing G-actin, heat-denatured actin or albumin. The effect of actin on leukotoxicity was concentration-dependent and directly associated with increases in secreted leukotoxin.

The most common site of ulcers is the leg, where the ulcers are often extremely painful, with violaceous macules surrounding them, and are associated with extensive edema. On biopsy, histological vascular changes include leukocytoclastic vasculitis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, formation of thrombus, swelling of the endothelial cells, and thickening of the vascular walls.

Introduction of a halogenoacetyl substituent.,584-92,"In the course of structure-activity relationships on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing a halogenoacetyl substituent were synthesized with the expectation of increasing the interaction with DNA, possibly via covalent reaction with the double helix. Two rebeccamycin analogues bearing an acetyl instead of a bromoacetyl substituent were prepared to gain an insight into the role of the halogen atom. The new compounds show very little effect on protein kinase C and no covalent reaction with DNA was detected. However, the drugs behave as typical topoisomerase I poisons, and they are significantly more toxic toward P388 leukemia cells than to P388/CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. The introduction of a bromo- or chloro-acetyl substituent does not affect the capacity of the drug to interfere with topoisomerase I either in vitro or in cells. One of the bromoacetyl derivatives, compound 8, is the most cytotoxic rebeccamycin derivative among the hundred of derivatives we have synthesized to date. In addition, we determined the antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, and against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli.

The residue X is Met 184 in HIV-1 RT and Val 223 in MuLV RT. This residue has been implicated in the fidelity of DNA synthesis, whereas the role of the preceding tyrosine in this aspect, as well as in the catalytic mechanism of MuLV RT, remains to be elucidated. We have substituted Tyr 222 with Phe, Ser, and Ala by site-directed mutagenesis and have characterized the properties of the individual mutant enzymes. The results show that Tyr-->Phe substitution did not affect the polymerase activity of the enzyme, while Tyr-->Ser and Tyr-->Ala substitutions significantly reduced the polymerase activity. The pyrophosphorolysis activities of these mutants showed the same trend as the polymerase activities, suggesting an essential role for Y222 in the catalytic mechanism of MuLV RT. One of the most interesting observations of Y-->F substitution was the significantly increased fidelity of DNA synthesis on RNA templates. In addition, a limited extent of ribonucleotide incorporation on RNA template that was consistently noted with the wild-type enzyme was reduced with the Y222F mutant. The resistance to all four ddNTPs, however, persisted in the wild type and Y222 mutants on the RNA template. A ternary complex model of MuLV RT shows that (a) the aromatic ring of Tyr/Phe is positioned between the terminal and penultimate primer bases and (b) the phenolic OH group is seen within hydrogen bonding distance with the base moieties of two template and penultimate primer nucleotides. We propose that the base stacking interaction of Tyr 222 stabilizes the primer terminus position which is essential for the catalytic reaction. However, the weaker stacking interaction of Y compared to F, due to polarization of the pi-charge toward the phenoxyl-OH as well as the resonating character of its H-bond center, may provide slight flexibility to the position of the template base which may be responsible for the error-proneness of MuLV RT.","['Kaushik, N', 'Singh, K', 'Alluru, I', 'Modak, M J']","['Kaushik N', 'Singh K', 'Alluru I', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA. modak@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoric Acids)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.7.48 (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Pair Mismatch/genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/genetics', 'Dideoxynucleosides/pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Acids/metabolism', 'Plasmids/chemical synthesis', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi9824285 [doi]', 'bi9824285 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1999 Mar 2;38(9):2617-27. doi: 10.1021/bi9824285.,['GM36307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, information dealing with the impact on overall survival of the simultaneous increase of either beta2-m or sCD23 are lacking. In this prospective study based on 106 B-cell CLL patients, we propose a combination of beta2-m and sCD23 as a strong prognostic system whose statistical significance was mainly due to an excess of deaths in the subgroup displaying increased serum levels of either beta2-m or sCD23. Multivariate survival analysis confirmed the important dominant role of such a finding, thus excluding features with a high degree of codependence (i.e. clinical stages, LDT) and including variables with low association (i.e. BM histology) in the final regression model. The presence of increased serum levels of beta2-m/sCD23 and diffuse BM histology signified high-risk disease, whereas the absence of any adverse variable was associated with prolonged survival; in between there was a subgroup with only 1 characteristic which displayed an intermediate pattern of survival. Finally, on the basis combined increased serum levels of beta2-m and sCD23, a better stratification of low- and intermediate-risk patients could be obtained, thus allowing the formulation of a clinico-biological staging for CLL.","['Molica, S', 'Levato, D', 'Cascavilla, N', 'Levato, L', 'Musto, P']","['Molica S', 'Levato D', 'Cascavilla N', 'Levato L', 'Musto P']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, IgE/*blood', 'Survival Analysis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01731.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Feb;62(2):117-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01731.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 324 patients aged up to 70 yr and the 10(8) older patients were dealt with as separate groups. Irrespective of the primary chemotherapy regimen, the level of response was not significantly influencing in the OS time, and this was true in both age categories. The median OS of the patients up to 70 yr of age who had any response was 57 months, compared to the 10 months of those with PD (p < 0.001). The corresponding figures for the older patients were 40 and 4 months (p <0.001), respectively. The pretreatment prognosticators for the patients with minimal responses were not more favourable than for patients with responses at higher levels.

It was shown that FL as a single factor had no stimulatory effect on GM colony formation either in the whole MPD group or in the MPD subgroups, which comprised 9 patients with essential thrombocythaemia, 7 with polycythaemia vera and 8 with chronic myelogenous leukaemia. No increase in GM colony formation was observed, either, when FL was used in combination with other GFs, such as mast cell growth factor (MGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), GM-CSF or interleukin-3 (IL-3).

From each group, fibroblastic (F) colony-forming units (CFU) and SL were established and their growth quantitated. Upon confluence of SL, 1 x 10(4)selected CD34+ cells from patient or control samples (of group A and B) were seeded on pre-formed SL from AML or control group A and B layers and adhesive precursors were scored for the formation of blastic (-b1) CFU (>20 cells). Lastly, CD34+ cells from the 4 progenitor sources were cultured in the presence of growth factors and scored for the production of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CFU, erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) and mixed colonies (CFU-MIX). In the patients, CFU-F numbers were decreased and by 5 wk SL failed to reach confluence. Group A AML CD34+ progenitors gave a mean of 119.2 (SD 80.4) CFU-bl/10(4) CD34+ cells, but following cryopreservation these numbers declined (83.2, SD 72.71; p = 0.009). Although AML SL prior to cryopreservation supported control CFU-bl adequately, contrary to the norm, this property decreased in group B stroma (mean 50.9/10(4)CD34+ cells, SD 49.33; p =(0.02). Group B AML samples gave significantly fewer CFU-MIX and BFU-E than pre-freezing cultures and than control samples at the first 2-growth factor combination but numbers improved following further addition of cytokines. We conclude that cryopreservation of the bone marrow of patients in CR of AML results in an inhibition of the proliferation of the CD34+ precursors. It also modifies the stroma, leading to reductions in the support of normal clones.","['Novitzky, N', 'Kruger, W', 'Mohamed, R']","['Novitzky N', 'Kruger W', 'Mohamed R']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, the Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, South Africa. novitzky@samiotuct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01726.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Feb;62(2):83-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01726.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCL cell proliferation is regulated by growth factors and cytokines, of which tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may be one of the most important. The mechanism of TNF-alpha-induced HCL cell growth is mediated via 2 receptors, which are present in both cellular and soluble forms. In this study we determined the serum levels of TNF-alpha and their soluble receptors - sTNF-R60 and sTNF-R80 - in 23 HCL patients and correlated them with clinical parameters before and after therapy. Patients were classified according to their clinical status as either ""active"" at diagnosis or during relapse and ""non-active"" (responding to therapy with partial and complete remission). Most patients were treated with 2-CDA, following which serum levels of TNF-alpha, sTNF-R60 and sTNF-R80 were significantly decreased, particularly in CR. Significant differences in paired observation values were noted for TNF-alpha and sTNF-R80, indicating a good correlation with the clinical status of disease, but this was not the case for sTNF-R60 (coefficients of correlation between levels of TNF-alpha and sTNF-R80 and of TNF-alpha and sTNF-R60 were r = 0.85 and r= 0.64, respectively). These results suggest that decreases in both TNF-alpha and sTNF-R80 are indicative of response to treatment, while increased levels accompany active disease. Accordingly, we conclude that serum levels of the TNF family, as for the sIL-2R and IL-1 family, may also be used as sensitive markers for monitoring HCL status. Levels may be indicative of the clinical efficacy of therapy and can be used as an indicator of the presence of residual disease.","['Barak, V', 'Nisman, B', 'Polliack, A']","['Barak V', 'Nisman B', 'Polliack A']","['Department of Oncology, Hadassah Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Deoxyadenosines/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01724.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Feb;62(2):71-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01724.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the 2.35 A structure of a ternary complex containing a human HoxB1-Pbx1 heterodimer bound to DNA. Heterodimer contacts are mediated by the hexapeptide of HoxB1, which binds in a pocket in the Pbx1 protein formed in part by a three-amino acid insertion in the Pbx1 homeodomain. The Pbx1 DNA-binding domain is larger than the canonical homeodomain, containing an additional alpha helix that appears to contribute to binding of the HoxB1 hexapeptide and to stable binding of Pbx1 to DNA. The structure suggests a model for modulation of Hox DNA binding activity by Pbx1 and related proteins.","['Piper, D E', 'Batchelor, A H', 'Chang, C P', 'Cleary, M L', 'Wolberger, C']","['Piper DE', 'Batchelor AH', 'Chang CP', 'Cleary ML', 'Wolberger C']","['Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB1 homeodomain protein)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Dimerization', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(00)80662-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80662-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1999 Feb 19;96(4):587-97. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80662-5.,['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['PDB/1B72'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Nine isolates of Aspergillus species were obtained from invasive oral infections in 9 patients with hematologic malignancies and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole, miconazole, 5-fluorocytosine, and itraconazole. Minimal inhibitory concentration values of the 5 drugs were obtained for each fungus through use of a microdilution broth method. The patients were treated with intravenous amphotericin B (30-50 mg/day) in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (3000-6000 mg/day) and/or oral itraconazole (200 mg/day). RESULTS: Amphotericin B and itraconazole were found to be very active, with minimal inhibitory concentration values of 0.861 and 0.194 microg/mL, respectively. Miconazole and 5-fluorocytosine showed minimal inhibitory concentration values of 1.72 and 3.56 microg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, fluconazole FCZ showed low activity, with a minimal inhibitory concentration value in excess of 64.0 microg/mL. During neutropenia, combined antifungal chemotherapy stabilized oral aspergillosis and prevented the spread of oral lesions in 8 patients in whom neutrophil counts eventually recovered. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that in vitro susceptibility testing may serve as an informative parameter with respect to the efficacy of these antifungals in the treatment of invasive oral aspergillosis, inducing fungal stasis until the neutrophils recover.","['Myoken, Y', 'Sugata, T', 'Myoken, Y', 'Kyo, T', 'Fujihara, M', 'Mikami, Y']","['Myoken Y', 'Sugata T', 'Myoken Y', 'Kyo T', 'Fujihara M', 'Mikami Y']","['Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross-Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics",9508562,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7NNO0D7S5M (Miconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*drug therapy', 'Aspergillus/*drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flucytosine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Itraconazole/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Miconazole/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-2104(99)70269-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70269-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod. 1999 Feb;87(2):174-9. doi: 10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70269-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Application of hyperpolarizing voltage steps from the holding potential of 0 mV revealed that ICRAC declined in amplitude over tens of milliseconds during steps more negative than -40 mV. This fast inactivation was predominantly Ca2+-dependent because first, it could be more effectively suppressed when BAPTA was included in the recording pipette instead of EGTA and second, replacing external Ca2+ with Sr2+ resulted in less inactivation. Recovery from inactivation was faster in the presence of BAPTA than EGTA. The extent of fast inactivation was independent of the whole cell ICRAC amplitude, compatible with the notion that the inactivation arose from a local feedback inhibition by permeating Ca2+ ions only on the channel it permeated. Ca2+ release from stores did not affect fast inactivation, nor did FCepsilonRI receptor stimulation. Current clamp recordings showed that the majority of RBL cells had a membrane potential close to -90 mV following stimulation of FCepsilonRI receptors. Hence fast inactivation is likely to impact on the extent of Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels under physiological conditions and appears to be an important negative feedback process that limits Ca2+ increases.","['Fierro, L', 'Parekh, A B']","['Fierro L', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cysteine/physiology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/drug effects/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/03 00:00,1999/03/03 00:01,['1999/03/03 00:00'],"['1999/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002329900493 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1999 Mar 1;168(1):9-17. doi: 10.1007/s002329900493.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, for hematopoietic cells, both stimulation and inhibition of proliferation by adhesion to extracellular matrix components have been described. Furthermore, it has been suggested that progenitor cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia show decreased beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin, resulting in increased proliferation and abnormal trafficking. However, we show here that the chronic myelogenous leukemia-specific fusion protein p210bcr/abl stimulates the expression of alpha5beta1 integrins and induces adhesion to fibronectin when expressed in the myeloid cell line 32D. Moreover, proliferation of both p210bcr/abl-transfected 32D (32Dp210) cells and untransfected 32D cells is stimulated by immobilized fibronectin. Cell cycle analysis revealed that nonadherent 32D and 32Dp210 cells are arrested in late G1 or early S phase, whereas the adherent fractions continue cycling. Although both adherent and nonadherent p210bcr/abl-transfected and parental 32D cells express equal amounts of cyclin A, a protein necessary for cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary, cyclin A complexes immunoprecipitated from 32D cells cultured on immobilized fibronectin were found to be catalytically inactive in nonadherent but not in adherent cells. In addition, as compared with untransfected 32D cells, cyclin A immunoprecipitates from 32Dp210 cells exhibited a greatly elevated kinase activity and remained partially active irrespective of the adhesion status. The lack of cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 activity in nonadherent 32D cells appeared to result from increased expression and cyclin A complex formation of the CDK inhibitor p27(Kip1). Taken together, our results indicate that adhesion stimulates cell cycle progression of hematopoietic cells by down-regulation of p27(Kip1), resulting in activation of cyclin A/CDK2 complexes and subsequent transition through the G1/S adhesion checkpoint.","['Kramer, A', 'Horner, S', 'Willer, A', 'Fruehauf, S', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Hallek, M', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Kramer A', 'Horner S', 'Willer A', 'Fruehauf S', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hallek M', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

We had previously shown that tolerantly ALV-infected males, from ALV injection into fertile chicken eggs at day of set, can transmit proviral DNA to their progeny through the germline. An attempt was made to repeat this successful retroviral germline insertion technique of chickens in Japanese quail. After an initial difficulty of infecting quail chicks in ovo at day of set with high titer nonpathogenic recombinant and pathogenic ALV, adequate numbers of tolerantly ALV-infected quail were produced by injecting ALV-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) at day of set. Tolerantly ALV-infected male and female quail were then mated to nonviremic quail and vertical transmission of ALV to progeny chicks was determined by analyzing blood for viral antigens and proviral DNA using standard techniques. Vertical transmission of ALV was only detected in the progeny of viremic females. Thus, little or no germline transmission of ALV to progeny occurred from viremic males. Tolerantly ALV-infected males and females from congenital ALV infection, which should infect the embryo and presumably the primordial germ cells (PGC) earlier than egg injection, were mated to nonviremic quails. Vertical transmission of ALV to progeny chicks was analyzed as before. Again, vertical transmission of ALV was only detected in the progeny of viremic females.

A characteristic of HTLV-I-transformed T cells is the constitutive nuclear expression of NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors, which appears to be essential for the growth of these transformed cells. Although NF-kappaB/Rel factors are known to induce the expression of T-cell growth factor interleukin (IL)-2, it is unclear how they participate in the IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-I-transformed cells. In this study, we show that certain NF-kappaB/Rel members, predominantly c-Rel, interact with enhancer sequences for STAT5, a key transcription factor mediating IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation. Reporter gene assays reveal that the binding of c-Rel to the STAT5 site present in the Fc gammaR1 gene leads to potent transactivation of this enhancer. Binding of c-Rel to the Fc gammaR1 STAT site also occurs in human peripheral blood T cells immortalized with HTLV-I in vitro and is correlated with enhanced levels of proliferation of these cells. These results raise the possibility that NF-kappaB/Rel may participate in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed T cells by regulating genes driven by both kappaB and certain STAT enhancers.","['Sun, S C', 'Maggirwar, S B', 'Harhaj, E W', 'Uhlik, M']","['Sun SC', 'Maggirwar SB', 'Harhaj EW', 'Uhlik M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey Medical Center 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Milk Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202430 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Feb 18;18(7):1401-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202430.,"['1 R01 CA68471-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 CA 6039-5/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PNH is associated with bone marrow failure syndromes including aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and leukaemia. Bone marrow transplants are sometimes used to treat PNH, but small series and reporting biases make assessment of transplant outcome difficult. The outcome of 57 consecutive allogeneic bone marrow transplants for PNH reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) between 1978 and 1995 was analysed. The 2-year probability of survival in 48 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants was 56% (95% confidence interval 49-63%). Two recipients of identical twin transplants remain alive 8 and 12 years after treatment. One of seven recipients of alternative donor allogeneic transplants is alive 5 years after transplant. The most common causes of treatment failure were graft failure and infections. Our results indicate that bone marrow transplantation can restore normal bone marrow function in about 50% of PNH patients.","['Saso, R', 'Marsh, J', 'Cevreska, L', 'Szer, J', 'Gale, R P', 'Rowlings, P A', 'Passweg, J R', 'Nugent, M L', 'Luzzatto, L', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Gordon-Smith, E C']","['Saso R', 'Marsh J', 'Cevreska L', 'Szer J', 'Gale RP', 'Rowlings PA', 'Passweg JR', 'Nugent ML', 'Luzzatto L', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gordon-Smith EC']","[""Department of Haematology, St George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01195.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Feb;104(2):392-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01195.x.,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The more frequent MDR clusters were PGP-/LRP-/MRP- (32/96 cases, 33%) and the PGP+/LRP+/MRP- (27/96 cases, 28%) followed by PGP+/LRP-/MRP- (15/96 cases, 16%) and PGP-/LRP+/MRP- (14/96 cases, 14%). A favourable karyotype was observed more frequently in PGP- and LRP-cases. A highly significant correlation was found between either PGP or LRP overexpression and leukaemic blast cell IDA. All the patients received standard induction and consolidation treatments containing MDR-related (idarubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide) and other (arabinosyl cytosine) drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that PGP overexpression was significantly associated with a poor response to treatment, both in terms of primary resistance or shorter survival. Other independent prognostic factors were age and cytogenetics. LRP overexpression did not reach statistical significance, although for LRP+ cases the trend was unfavourable. Due to small numbers, no conclusion could be made regarding MRP overexpression, but 5/8 cases showed unfavourable karyotypic abnormalities, 8/8 had a defective IDA and 6/8 failed to achieve remission. This study showed that both PGP and LRP overexpression are common features in de novo ANLL at onset whereas MRP overexpression is more rare. It suggested that overexpression of one of the MDR related proteins was associated with a defective IDA, and confirmed that, in addition to age and cytogenetics, PGP retains an independent prognostic value. It also suggested that LRP did not affect clinical outcome when patients were treated with idarubicin or mitoxantrone and arabinosyl cytosine.","['Michieli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Ermacora, A', 'Masolini, P', 'Raspadori, D', 'Visani, G', 'Scheper, R J', 'Baccarani, M']","['Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Ermacora A', 'Masolini P', 'Raspadori D', 'Visani G', 'Scheper RJ', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Medical and Morphological Research, University Hospital, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*metabolism']",,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01172.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Feb;104(2):328-35. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01172.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro cytotoxicity of 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide (IFOS), daunorubicin (DNR) and prednisolone (PRED) was assessed by the MTT assay. Expression of alpha, mu and pi class GST did not significantly differ between leukaemic cells from 100 initial and 14 unrelated relapse ALL patients (GSTalpha P=026; GSTmu P=O009; GSTpi P=0.13). The expression of GSTalpha (1.4-fold, P=0.0004), GSTpi (13-fold, P = 0001) and to a lesser extent also GSTmu (1.1-fold, P=0.03) was higher in ALL compared with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.

In contrast, GSTalpha was median 2-fold lower expressed in the AML samples (P< 0.0001). Expression levels of alpha, mu and pi class GSTs were not related to the degree of resistance to IFOS, DNR and PRED nor to immunophenotype, white blood cell count or age at presentation of childhood ALL. One exception was a remarkably low expression of GSTalpha in IFOS-sensitive samples compared with a heterogenous expression in IFOS-resistant samples (P= 0.02). Expression of GSTpi, but not of GSTalpha or GSTmu, weakly correlated with the expression of MRP (Rs 0.36, P = 0.002, n = 74) but not with P-gp. However, a high expression of both GSTpi and MRP was not associated with in vitro resistance to IFOS, DNR or PRED. The present data suggest that expression of GSTs is not linked to the degree of resistance to IFOS, DNR and PRED or clinical risk factors in childhood ALL. Whether the high expression of GSTmu and GSTpi in AML cells contributes to the relative resistance to IFOS, DNR and PRED compared with ALL samples (P < or = 0.0001) warrants further study.","['Den Boer, M L', 'Pieters, R', 'Kazemier, K M', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Henze, G', 'Creutzig, U', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Kearns, P R', 'Hall, A G', 'Pearson, A D', 'Veerman, A J']","['Den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Kazemier KM', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Henze G', 'Creutzig U', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Kearns PR', 'Hall AG', 'Pearson AD', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology']",,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01189.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Feb;104(2):321-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01189.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously reported data from children treated with Erwinase showed significantly lower trough levels and pharmacokinetic dose intensity than after E. coli-derived preparations. Hence, schedule optimization was initiated to achieve relevant serum activities. 21 children on reinduction therapy received Erwinase on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for 3 weeks (9 x 20000 IU/m2 i.v.) instead of 4x 10 000IU/m2 of E. coli asparaginase (twice weekly for 2 weeks). Asparaginase trough activities were measured as the primary parameter, targeting 100-200 IU/I after 2 d and >50 IU/l after 3 d. Concurrently, asparagine trough concentrations were monitored. The mean trough activity was 156+/-99 IU/l, with 2/108 samples showing no detectable activity. Regarding trough levels per individual (three or more measurements/patient), means ranged from 52+/-29 to 276+/-114 IU/l (20 patients, 106 samples), with nine, six, and five children inside, below, and above the target range, respectively.

Mean trough activities calculated per individual ranged from < 20-84+/-30 IU/l (14 patients, 42 samples) with seven children below the target limit of 50 IU/l and asparagine concentrations <0.2 - 1.5microM. We concluded that an increased dose of 9x20000 IU/m2 of Erwinia asparaginase within 3 weeks resulted in a pharmacokinetic dose intensity comparable to former observations made with 4 x 10 000IU/m2 of the E. coli product Crasnitin which is no longer marketed.

Our primary test is a standardized assay for daunorubicin accumulation. Confirmatory assays for MDR comprised the cyclosporin modulation assay for rhodamine-123 uptake as a measure of functional P-glycoprotein and the measurement of lung resistance protein and multidrug resistance associated protein (with LRP-56 and MRPr1 respectively). 57% of samples had both low accumulation and at least one positive confirmatory test. 32% were MDR negative in all four assays. 15% of patients had primary chemo-resistant disease. Resistant disease rates were 22% for confirmed MDR-positive patients and 0% for confirmed MDR-negative patients (P=0.07). Complete remission was achieved in 74% of patients, with rates of 63% in confirmed MDR-positive patients and 93% in confirmed MDR-negative patients (P=0.06). The use of a standardized method for daunorubicin uptake, combined with the use of confirmatory tests, should reduce the uncertainty that is currently characteristic of MDR evaluation in leukaemia.

This suggests an additional role for p-glycoprotein in mediating drug resistance beyond that of a drug efflux pump.","['Pallis, M', 'Turzanski, J', 'Harrison, G', 'Wheatley, K', 'Langabeer, S', 'Burnett, A K', 'Russell, N H']","['Pallis M', 'Turzanski J', 'Harrison G', 'Wheatley K', 'Langabeer S', 'Burnett AK', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital and University of Nottingham, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01157.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Feb;104(2):307-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01157.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore the K562 cell line has been proposed as a useful in vitro model system to determine the therapeutic potential of new differentiating compounds as well as to study the molecular mechanism(s) regulating changes in the expression of embryonic and fetal human globin genes. Inducers of erythroid differentiation which stimulate gamma-globin synthesis could be considered for possible use in the experimental therapy of those haematological diseases associated with a failure in the expression of adult beta-globin genes.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the rate of occurrence (RO) of HPA in a population of 522,621 inhabitants (Males: 252,721; Females: 269,900) showing a negative vegetative growth (-1.4/10(5) inhabitants/year), said occurrence being dealt with separately for the population under age 60 and the population over age 60. METHODS: In January-December, 1994, a estimate was made of the HPA rate of occurrence and rate of analyses among the patients from the area in question, dealing separately with those under age 60 and over age 60. The diagnostic criteria applied were Monoclonal Gammopathies of Undetermined Significance (MGUS's) in keeping with Kyle's criteria. Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia (CLL) in keeping with the Myeloma Task Force criteria. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's Disease (HD) in keeping with the REAL classification, Myelodisplasic Syndromes (MS's) and Acute Leukemia (AL) in keeping with the FAB classification, Chronic Myeloproliferative Syndromes (CMS's) in keeping with the PVSG. For calculating the rates of occurrence, descriptive epidemiological methods were used. RESULTS: The highest rates of blood analyses as the result of suspected APH's fell within the over 60 age group (p < 0.0001). During the length of time analyzed, a total of 302 APH's (< 60/> or = years: 100/202, p < 0.0001) were diagnosis, being worthy of special mention: 84 MGUS's; 21 MM's; 57 NHL's; 26 CLL's; 33 CMS's; 11 AL's and 14 HD's. The spread by gender was: Males: 177; Females 125. Average age: 63.54 years (age range 19-92). The rates of occurrence (cases/10(5) inhabitants/year) were (< age 60/> or = age 60): overall: 31.31/178.86; MGUS: 7.37/52.87; MM: 1.84/13.21; NHL: 5.53/34.36; CLL: 1.53/18.50; MS: 0.62/27.31; CMS: 5.52/16.74; AL: 1.53/5.29; HD: 3.68/1.76. CONCLUSIONS: The highest rate of analyses as the result of suspected APH was found among those over 60 years of age. The overall occurrence of APH is significantly higher in those over age 60, as well as for each type of APH taken into account, except for AL and HD. The highest rate of occurrence is that of MGUS, NHL and MS's, especially in males.","['Giraldo Castellano, P', 'Franco Garcia, E', 'Bernal Perez, M', 'Huelin Domeco de Jarauta, J', 'Rubio-Felix, D', 'Giralt Raichs, M']","['Giraldo Castellano P', 'Franco Garcia E', 'Bernal Perez M', 'Huelin Domeco de Jarauta J', 'Rubio-Felix D', 'Giralt Raichs M']","['Servicio de Hematologia-Hemoterapia Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza. pgiraldo@sangrezar.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Rev Esp Salud Publica,Revista espanola de salud publica,9600212,,IM,"['Aged', '*Aging', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Spain/epidemiology']",71,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Esp Salud Publica. 1998 Nov-Dec;72(6):559-70.,,,,Envejecimiento poblacional e incidencia de hemopatias primarias adquiridas en un area de la Comunidad Autonoma de Aragon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report further that the high density methylation of the RSV LTR-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter is needed for full transcriptional inhibition in chicken embryo fibroblasts and for suppression of tumorigenicity of the RSV proviral DNA in chickens. In nonpermissive mammalian cells, however, the low density methylation is sufficient for full inhibition. The time course of inhibition differs strikingly in avian and mammalian cells: although immediately inhibited in mammalian cells, the methylated RSV LTR-driven reporter is fully inhibited with a significant delay after transfection in avian cells. Moreover, transcriptional inhibition can be overridden by transfection with a high dose of the methylated reporter plasmid in chicken cells but not in hamster cells. The LTR, v-src, LTR proviral DNA is easily capable of inducing sarcomas in chickens but not in hamsters. In contrast, Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR-driven v-src induces sarcomas in hamsters with high incidence.

Subcellular fractionation did not indicate a specific co-localisation between membrane-bound GAP1(m) and several Ca2+ store markers, consistent with the lack of co-localisation between GAP1(m) and SERCA1 upon co-expression in COS-7 cells.

As GAP1(m) is primarily localised to the cytosol of unstimulated cells it may be spatially regulated in order to interact with Ras at the plasma membrane.","['Lockyer, P J', 'Vanlingen, S', 'Reynolds, J S', 'McNulty, T J', 'Irvine, R F', 'Parys, J B', 'Cullen, P J']","['Lockyer PJ', 'Vanlingen S', 'Reynolds JS', 'McNulty TJ', 'Irvine RF', 'Parys JB', 'Cullen PJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medical Sciences, University of Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RASA2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate receptor)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '102850-29-3 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/biosynthesis', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Organ Specificity', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",,1999/03/02 00:00,1999/03/02 00:01,['1999/03/02 00:00'],"['1999/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(99)90217-6 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1999.0217 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Feb 16;255(2):421-6. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0217.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the observations that activation-associated increases in intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) strengthen interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, and that the lateral mobility of cell surface adhesion receptors is an important regulator of cellular adhesion strength, we postulated that [Ca2+]i controls CD2 lateral mobility at the T cell surface. Human Jurkat T leukemia cells were stimulated by antibody-mediated cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 complex. CD2 was labeled with a fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibody. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques were used to measure [Ca2+]i and CD2 lateral mobility. Cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 complex caused an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i and, 10-20 min later, a decrease in the fractional mobility of CD2 from the control value of 68 +/- 1% to 45 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM). One to two hours after cell stimulation the fractional mobility spontaneously returned to the control level. Under these and other treatment conditions, the fraction of cells with significantly elevated [Ca2+]i was highly correlated with the fraction of cells manifesting significantly reduced CD2 mobility. Pretreatment of cells with a calmodulin inhibitor or a calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor prevented Ca2+-mediated CD2 immobilization, and pretreatment of cells with a calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor prevented the spontaneous reversal of CD2 immobilization. These data suggest that T cell activation through the TCR/CD3 complex controls CD2 lateral mobility by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent mechanism, and that this mechanism may involve regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CD2 or a closely associated protein.","['Liu, S Q', 'Golan, D E']","['Liu SQ', 'Golan DE']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'CD2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calmodulin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(99)77327-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77327-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1999 Mar;76(3):1679-92. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77327-3.,"['HL-15157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1300144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting immune suppression is the main cause of death in those patients. In the present study we addressed the question of whether leukemic B cells (B-CLL) are able to suppress regular T cell/B cell interaction. Activated CD4+ T cell clones induce expression of the early activation antigen CD23 on B lymphocytes in vitro. Under conditions used, this B cell activation event was dependent upon direct T cell contact. Addition of certain bystander B-CLL cells or normal B lymphocytes resulted in a cell number-dependent inhibition of B cell induction. This seems to reflect the competition of B-CLL cells for a cell contact-mediated T cell helper signal. By using CD40 ligand transfected fibroblasts as a substitute for T cell help, we show that the same B-CLL cells also suppress CD40 ligand-mediated B cell activation. B-CLL cells differ in their ability to inhibit CD40 ligand-mediated B cell activation. Some B-CLL cases (eight out of 14) are unable to compete for the T cell or CD40 ligand-mediated signal, even though they can functionally interact with CD40 ligand and thereby get activated themselves. In addition, these results indicate that the observed inhibition is not a result of cell crowding by merely reducing the chance of specific B cell/T cell interactions. Collectively, these data indicate that B-CLL cells are able to inhibit the interaction of activated T lymphocytes with normal B lymphocytes in vitro. Perturbed T cell/B cell interaction may represent an important mechanism underlying the various defects of the specific immune system observed in patients suffering from B-CLL.","['Kneitz, C', 'Goller, M', 'Wilhelm, M', 'Mehringer, C', 'Wohlleben, G', 'Schimpl, A', 'Tony, H P']","['Kneitz C', 'Goller M', 'Wilhelm M', 'Mehringer C', 'Wohlleben G', 'Schimpl A', 'Tony HP']","['Medizinische Poliklinik der Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-D Antigens/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transfection']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401235 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):98-104. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of MIP-1alpha and IL-3 to AFT024 LDA increased the measured LTC-IC frequency to 6.8 +/- 0.9%. We also determined the fraction of LTC-IC that persisted after 34+/Lin cells were cultured for 5 weeks by replating progeny in the three LDA readout systems.

Recently, a tumor suppressor gene, the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 gene (MEN1) was cloned and mapped to chromosome 11q13. To assess the potential involvement of this gene in lymphomagenesis, we examined 94 primary cases of lymphoma and 12 cell lines by a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization and PCR-SSCP analysis. In our initial analysis of 41 primary B or T lymphomas, MEN1 FISH analysis revealed allelic deletions in 15 cases (three of four B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, six of 15 follicular lymphomas, three of nine diffuse large B cell lymphomas, two of five mantle cell lymphomas, one of four Burkitt's lymphoma). To discern whether the MEN1 gene was in fact the target of the deletions, we assessed 20 of these 41 cases and an additional 74 primary lymphomas and 12 cell lines for MEN1 gene mutations using PCR-SSCP analysis. Abnormal SSCP patterns were found in exon 2 in two of the primary lymphoma cases and in one of the cell lines, but not in any of the original cases that showed MEN1 deletions by FISH. Furthermore, sequencing analysis revealed that the abnormal SSCP patterns in exon 2 were the result of a previously described genetic polymorphism (S145S: AGC --> ACT), and in one sample, the result of this S145S polymorphism associated with a second nucleotide substitution at position 498 which left the encoded amino acid unchanged. Our study indicates that the 11q13 locus is a frequent target of deletion in lymphoid neoplasms, but that there are no associated mutations of the MEN1 gene. This suggests that the 11q deletions either target another gene in lymphomas, or that the MEN1 gene is inactivated through means other than mutation.","['Thieblemont, C', 'Pack, S', 'Sakai, A', 'Beaty, M', 'Pak, E', 'Vortmeyer, A O', 'Wellmann, A', 'Zhuang, Z', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Raffeld, M']","['Thieblemont C', 'Pack S', 'Sakai A', 'Beaty M', 'Pak E', 'Vortmeyer AO', 'Wellmann A', 'Zhuang Z', 'Jaffe ES', 'Raffeld M']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Exons', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401216 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):85-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401216.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to test the hypothesis that theophylline works through an indirect increase in cAMP, we have investigated the role of several molecules on B-CLL cells from 20 patients. Direct cAMP inducers such as dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and forskolin induced moderate apoptosis but extremely high levels of intracellular cAMP. By contrast theophylline was highly apoptotic but did not synergize with cAMP inducers. Apoptosis was completely reversed by a cAMP antagonist when induced by PGE2 or forskolin, but was only partially antagonized when induced by theophylline. Since CD38+ CLL cells are more sensitive to apoptosis and since CD38 is enhanced by cAMP inducing agents its expression was investigated. In our hands CD38 was not induced by the above pharmacological compounds. Exogenous IL-10 has been shown to induce CLL cell death; however, apoptosis following treatment with theophylline or cAMP inducers could not be ascribed to endogenous production of IL-10. This ruled out the involvement of cytokines or of an activation or differentiation process in apoptosis. Altogether our data show that an increase in intracellular cAMP mediates apoptosis in vitro but accounts only partly for theophylline-mediated apoptosis.","['Mentz, F', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Dalloul, A H']","['Mentz F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Dalloul AH']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, UMR 7627, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', ""23645-17-2 (adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate)"", '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*biosynthesis', 'Theophylline/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401237 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):78-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that the cytocidal effect of caffeine may need to be verified independently of its cell cycle regulatory activities at least in some cases with p53 mutation.","['Takagi, M', 'Shigeta, T', 'Asada, M', 'Iwata, S', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Kanke, Y', 'Ishimoto, K', 'Mizutani, S']","['Takagi M', 'Shigeta T', 'Asada M', 'Iwata S', 'Nakazawa S', 'Kanke Y', 'Ishimoto K', 'Mizutani S']","[""Department of Virology, The National Children's Medical Research Center, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Genes, p53', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Ploidies', '*Point Mutation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/genetics', 'X-Rays']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401247 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):70-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401247.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the inhibitory effect of high dose bryostatin-1 (bryo-1) on normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) colony-forming capacity. Preculturing BMNC for 24 h with 250 nM bryo-1 reduced colony formation by 66 +/- 11% whereas this treatment did not reduce clonogenic capacity of highly purified CD34+ BMNC. When precultures with bryo-1 were performed in the presence of several cytokine neutralizing antibodies abrogation of the inhibitory effect could only be demonstrated by anti-TNF alpha. However, preculturing of BMNC or CD34+ cells with a wide range of TNF alpha concentrations as well as TNF alpha neutralization in supernatant of bryo-1-stimulated BMNC failed to affect the inhibitory effect on CD34+ cells. Both indicate that TNF alpha was not the only factor responsible for the inhibitory effect. Depletion of CD14+ cells from BMNC cultures showed that upon bryo-1 exposure the monocytes served as the main source of TNF alpha but not as a source of the inhibitory cytokine(s): in CD14+-depleted cultures the combination of exogenous added TNF alpha and bryo-1 resulted in an inhibition of colony formation comparable to that found in crude BMNC. In contrast, purified CD34+ cultures were not directly affected by bryo-1 and TNF alpha. However, clonogenic growth of purified CD34+ cells was inhibited if mononuclear cells were preincubated with TNF alpha alone for 24 h, and the supernatant of these cultures was used together with bryo-1. These results show that bryo-1-induced inhibition of clonogenic cell growth is not mediated by a direct effect of bryo-1 on CD34 cells but is a result of a process involving production of TNF alpha by CD14+ cells upon bryo-1 stimulation together with the induction of (a) secondary factor(s) by TNF alpha, which together with bryo-1 itself is inhibitory towards clonogenic cell growth.","['Drager, A M', 'van der Hem, K G', 'Zevenbergen, A', 'Odding, J H', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Drager AM', 'van der Hem KG', 'Zevenbergen A', 'Odding JH', 'Huijgens PC', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Dept of Hematology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Macrolides', 'Models, Biological', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/pharmacology/*physiology']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401250 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):62-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401250.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports have linked G-CSF-mediated differentiation to the ability of G-CSF to activate Stat3. We hypothesized that IL-3 suppresses 32Dcl3 differentiation in part through disruption of G-CSF-Stat signalling. We report that IL-3 inhibited the ability of G-CSF to induce Stat3 DNA binding. Moreover, we find that G-CSF activation of Stat3 binding to DNA is biphasic, peaking at 15-30 min and again at 6-8 h; both peaks are inhibited by IL-3. Transformation of 32Dcl3 cells by the v-abl oncogene leads to constitutive Stat3 activation and distinctive Stat-DNA-binding patterns which are not affected by G-CSF. Cross-modulation of Stat pathway signalling could be a physiologic mechanism for establishing a hierarchy of growth factor effects upon a cell exposed at once to multiple cytokines.","['Steinman, R A', 'Iro, A']","['Steinman RA', 'Iro A']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401253 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):54-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fas receptor, Fas ligand (FasL) pathway is a major mechanism of apoptosis. Since hematopoietic progenitors can express the Fas receptor, they may be susceptible to apoptosis induced by FasL-expressing cells. We examined FasL expression in the BM of patients with MDS (n = 50), de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 10), AML following prior MDS (n = 6), and normal controls (n = 6). Compared to controls, FasL expression was increased in MDS, and was highest in AML. In MDS, FasL expression was seen in myeloid blasts, erythroblasts, maturing myeloid cells, megakaryocytes and dysplastic cells, whereas in AML, intense expression was seen in the blasts. FasL expression correlated with the FAB subtype groups of MDS, and also correlated directly with the percentage of abnormal metaphases on cytogenetic analysis. The FasL expressed in MDS BM inhibited the growth of clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors. This inhibition could be blocked by a soluble recombinant FasFc protein. In MDS, FasL expression in the initial diagnostic BM was higher in patients who were more anemic, correlated directly with red cell transfusion requirements over the subsequent course of the disease, and was predictive of survival. These studies indicate that FasL expression in MDS is of prognostic significance, and suggest that pharmacological blockade of the Fas-FasL pathway may be of clinical benefit.","['Gupta, P', 'Niehans, G A', 'LeRoy, S C', 'Gupta, K', 'Morrison, V A', 'Schultz, C', 'Knapp, D J', 'Kratzke, R A']","['Gupta P', 'Niehans GA', 'LeRoy SC', 'Gupta K', 'Morrison VA', 'Schultz C', 'Knapp DJ', 'Kratzke RA']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center and University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55417, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*complications/pathology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401233 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):44-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401233.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Czech Paediatric Haematology Working Group.,22-4,"The presence of TEL/AML1 fusion gene in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) defines a subgroup of patients with better than average outcome. However, the prognostic significance of this aberration has recently been disputed by the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) study group due to its relatively high incidence found in relapsed patients (19.6% and 21.9%, in two cohorts). In contrast, only four out of 45 (8.9%) unselected relapsed patients (all of whom had been treated according to BFM protocols) in the Czech Republic carry this fusion. From March 1995 to June 1998, 41 out of 190 (21.6%) newly diagnosed children with ALL were TEL/AML1-positive. There is a statistically significant difference between the incidence of TEL/AML1 fusion at diagnosis and at relapse within our group (P = 0.035). Interim analysis of the minimal residual disease (MRD) detection shows heterogeneity within the group of newly diagnosed TEL/AML1-positive leukaemias--10 out of 24 patients tested at the end of induction therapy had detectable levels of MRD.

In addition to the ability of c-mpl ligand to support megakaryocytic development from CD34+ precursor cells, several lines of evidence also point to a stimulatory effect on hematopoietic stem cells. When recombinant thrombopoietin or pegylated megakaryocyte growth and development factor is administered to normal animals or humans, there is a dose-dependent increase in the platelet count. When administered following chemotherapy in animal models or humans, c-mpl ligands reduce the duration and sometimes the degree of thrombocytopenia. The issue of whether clinically relevant thrombocytopenia can be ameliorated has so far been more difficult to resolve. Because severe thrombocytopenia is not commonly seen with standard chemotherapy regimens, clinical studies examining c-mpl ligands for their ability to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia will focus on treatment of acute leukemias and bone marrow transplantation. The potential utility of c-mpl ligands for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemias, or in HIV infection, will have to be evaluated in the future. Possibly the greatest potential of thrombopoietic growth factors in the near future may be in transfusion medicine, to collect and to store platelets from healthy donors or in autologous settings.","['Hofmann, W K', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Hofmann WK', 'Ottmann OG', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Hematology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'HIV Infections/therapy', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology/*therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/*therapeutic use']",23,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):14-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts induces their 11-fold increased agglutination (81 +/- 7.8%) compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors (8 +/- 4.3%) which corroborates with flow cytometry studies. Agglutination of MOLT-4 (87 +/- 4.8%), a lymphoblastoid cell line and MDCK (91.25 +/- 0.01%), a cell line expressing surface 9-OAcSA, confirms the preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts through their surface 9-OAcSGs. Furthermore, fluorometric quantitation reveals a 4.6-fold increase in % of 9-OAcSA on lymphoblasts of ALL patients (42.1 +/- 4.1%) compared to normal donors (9.2 +/- 3.4%). Western blotting confirms that ATN(H) recognizes two membrane sialoglycoconjugates, of MW 120 kDa and 90 kDa, both having 9-OAcSA alpha2 --> 6 GalNAc terminal sugar moiety as their lectinogenic epitope.

However clinical MRD studies need standardized techniques. Therefore, several European laboratories have aligned their goals and performed comparative studies to achieve optimization and standardization of MRD techniques. This was achieved via the BIOMED-1 Concerted Action ""Investigation of minimal residual disease in acute leukemia: International standardization and clinical evaluation."" This report describes the development of PCR primers and protocols for the detection of MRD in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using clone-specific junctional regions of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangements and TAL1 deletions as PCR targets. A total of 54 primers was developed (1) to amplify rearrangements of the TCRD, TCRG, and IGK (Kde) genes as well as TAL1 deletions; (2) to sequence the junctional regions and breakpoint fusion regions; and (3) to perform MRD detection in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples during follow-up of ALL patients. Protocols were established to identify PCR targets at diagnosis by performing 25 PCR reactions per patient using appropriate positive and negative controls. Standardized protocols were developed for MRD monitoring via single amplification of the PCR target followed by dot blot hybridization with the corresponding patient-specific junctional region probe. In addition, alternative approaches were designed for cases where the target sensitivity of at least 10(-4) was not obtained. The standardization described here of MRD-PCR techniques is essential for the process of translating MRD research into clinical practice.","['Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Seriu, T', 'Stolz, F', ""d'Aniello, E"", 'Gameiro, P', 'Pisa, P', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Bartram, C R', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R', 'Biondi, A', 'San Miguel, J F', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Seriu T', 'Stolz F', ""d'Aniello E"", 'Gameiro P', 'Pisa P', 'Gonzalez M', 'Bartram CR', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Biondi A', 'San Miguel JF', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Clinical Protocols', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401245 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):110-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401245.,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1301-3.

A candidate tumor suppressor gene might reside telomeric of the retinoblastoma gene (RBl) at band 13q14 and to play a role in B cell neoplasm. The D13S319 locus, between RB1 and D13S25 loci at 13q14 is the most commonly deleted marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We evaluated the D13S319 locus in 24 MM cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We observed monosomy for D13S319 in 6/20 (30%) MM patients with an apparently normal karyotype. As expected, in four karyotypically abnormal MM cases with partial or complete monosomy for chromosome 13, all of them had monoallelic loss of D13S319. Our results indicated that the loss of D13S319 is commonly found in MM, even at diagnosis, and is more frequent than predicted based on conventional cytogenetic analysis of metaphase spreads. This finding implicates a candidate tumor suppressor gene at 13q14 in the pathogenesis of MM.","['Chang, H', 'Bouman, D', 'Boerkoel, C F', 'Stewart, A K', 'Squire, J A']","['Chang H', 'Bouman D', 'Boerkoel CF', 'Stewart AK', 'Squire JA']","['Hematology Division, The Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401208 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jan;13(1):105-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401208.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in the numbers of T lymphocytes and tumoral B cells as well as surface expression of T cell-activation markers were determined by flow cytometry, and cytokines (human IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-12) were measured in the cell culture supernatant. In 7 of 8 bone marrow samples, an increase in the number of CD4- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes was found, which correlated with an up-regulation of T cell-activation markers. Additionally, we demonstrated a decrease of tumoral B cells in 3 samples and enhanced cytotoxic T-cell activity against autologous malignant B cells. ELISpot analyses in an autologous Epstein-Barr virus model showed that bispecific antibodies (CD3xCD19+CD28) were more potent at generating T-cell responses against autologous and allogeneic tumoral targets than a combination of monospecific antibodies (CD3+CD28). Thus, T-cell targeting by CD3xCD19 bispecific and CD28 antibodies may be used to eliminate leukemic B cells ex vivo and reconstitute immunological control of residual malignant disease by the induction of anti-tumoral T-cell responses.","['Manzke, O', 'Berthold, F', 'Huebel, K', 'Tesch, H', 'Diehl, V', 'Bohlen, H']","['Manzke O', 'Berthold F', 'Huebel K', 'Tesch H', 'Diehl V', 'Bohlen H']","['Clinic I for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Blast Crisis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Preleukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Recurrence']",,1999/02/27 03:15,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/27 03:15'],"['1999/02/27 03:15 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/27 03:15 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990301)80:5<715::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990301)80:5<715::aid-ijc15>3.0.co;2-p [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Mar 1;80(5):715-22. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990301)80:5<715::aid-ijc15>3.0.co;2-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that HTLV-I prevalence in central Brooklyn may be similar to that recorded in the Caribbean islands. We established a pilot 1-year surveillance program to identify cases of ATL in 7 of 10 hospitals serving the residents of 18 zip codes of central Brooklyn with a combined population of 1,184,670. Of the 6,198 in-patient beds in the catchment area, approximately 83% were covered. Twelve incident cases of ATL were ascertained, all among persons of Afro-Caribbean descent, indicating an annual incidence in African-Americans in this community of approximately 3.2/100,000 person-years. Unexplained hypercalcemia was the most useful screening method, identifying 3 of 5 patients not referred for possible ATL by a local hematologist. The female:male ratio was 3:1. The age pattern was different from that reported in the Caribbean Basin and closer to the pattern seen in Japan. Our study supports evidence that HTLV-I infection and ATL are endemic in central Brooklyn and suggests that a more intensive surveillance program for this disease coupled with intervention efforts to reduce HTLV-I transmission are warranted.","['Levine, P H', 'Dosik, H', 'Joseph, E M', 'Felton, S', 'Bertoni, M A', 'Cervantes, J', 'Moulana, V', 'Miotti, A B', 'Goberdhan, L J', 'Lee, S L', 'Daouad, A', 'DaCosta, M', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Axiotis, C A', 'Cleghorn, F R', 'Kahn, A', 'Welles, S L']","['Levine PH', 'Dosik H', 'Joseph EM', 'Felton S', 'Bertoni MA', 'Cervantes J', 'Moulana V', 'Miotti AB', 'Goberdhan LJ', 'Lee SL', 'Daouad A', 'DaCosta M', 'Jaffe ES', 'Axiotis CA', 'Cleghorn FR', 'Kahn A', 'Welles SL']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

On the basis of these observations, we aimed to determine whether HTLV-I infection is present in isolated sweat glands. Eccrine gland epithelia were isolated from full thickness skin biopsies from 8 HTLV-I-seropositive and 7 seronegative individuals using dispase in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 13% fetal calf serum. We detected HTLV-IpX sequences in samples of eccrine sweat gland epithelia from 4 samples of the 8 seropositive individuals using nested polymerase chain reaction, but all 7 samples from the seronegative donors had no signal corresponding to the sequence.

We conducted a population-based, nationwide cohort study with exposure to outdoor work inferred from job titles reported in the population and housing censuses in 1960 and/or 1970 and by classifying each individual's work and home addresses according to latitude. Follow-up for cancer incidence was accomplished through record linkages with the virtually complete Swedish Cancer Registry. The cohort included all Swedish residents who were recorded as gainfully employed in both censuses. Altogether 4,171,175 individuals contributing 69,639,237 person-years accrued through 1989 were included in the analyses. We identified 10,381 cases of NHL, 4,018 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 11,398 cases of malignant melanoma (MM) and 11,913 cases of squamous cell skin cancer (SCC). We calculated age-adjusted relative risks for NHL, CLL, MM and SCC in strata based on estimated residential and occupational sunlight exposure. Interaction effects were considered for pesticide and solvent exposure. NHL, MM and SCC, but not CLL, were positively associated with increasingly southerly residential latitude, with stronger associations seen for skin cancer compared to NHL. Occupational sun exposure was not associated with the risk of developing any of the studied cancers. Pesticides and solvents also were not related to an increased risk of NHL, nor did these exposures enhance effects of residential or occupational sunlight exposure. Our results provide some support for an association of sunlight exposure with NHL incidence based on the associations seen using geographic latitude of residence as a proxy for exposure. Although type of occupation may be an imperfect index of the biologically relevant ultraviolet (UV) light dose, our data on individual exposure are not consistent with an important role of sunlight in the etiology of NHL.","['Adami, J', 'Gridley, G', 'Nyren, O', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Linet, M', 'Glimelius, B', 'Ekbom, A', 'Zahm, S H']","['Adami J', 'Gridley G', 'Nyren O', 'Dosemeci M', 'Linet M', 'Glimelius B', 'Ekbom A', 'Zahm SH']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

However, secondary malignomas can occur after treatment. Typically, secondary acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) after treatment with topo II inhibitors has a shorter latency period than t-AML following alkylator therapy. Fragments originating from chromosome breakage as well as whole chromosomes which are not correctly distributed during mitosis give rise to micronuclei in the next interphase. Micronucleus formation has become an important endpoint in genotoxicity testing. In an effort to test the suitability of the micronucleus assay for predictive purposes, we have analyzed three human tumor cell lines for cell growth as well as micronucleus induction after treatment with four clinically used topo II inhibitors. Micronuclei were induced at levels of low toxicity by etoposide, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin and idarubicin. The induction of micronuclei was a more sensitive indicator of drug effects than reduction in cell growth. Thus, micronucleus induction may assist in the prediction of the potency of a chemotherapeutic agent for induction of secondary malignomas.","['Stopper, H', 'Boos, G', 'Clark, M', 'Gieseler, F']","['Stopper H', 'Boos G', 'Clark M', 'Gieseler F']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Germany. stopper@toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-4274(98)00353-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(98)00353-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 1999 Jan 11;104(1-2):103-10. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(98)00353-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this rat study, in which the nerve to the medial head of the gastrocnemius was divided and repaired and slow-release LIF was administered at the repair site, we evaluated recovery by measuring the force of muscle contraction and of muscle bulk. Thirty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats (325-375 g) were randomly divided into 5 different groups according to type of treatment: denervated, end-to-end nerve repair, end-to-end nerve repair with LIF, neurotization, and neurotization with LIF. The contralateral side served as a nonoperated control group. Leukemia inhibitory factor was administered for 28 days to the site of the nerve repair via an implanted osmotic infusion pump. Muscle mass and muscular function were evaluated at 6 weeks using electrophysiologic techniques. The medial gastrocnemius muscle mass of the repair + LIF group was greater than the repair-alone group. The peak twitch, relative twitch, relative tetanic, and tetanic forces generated from the repair + LIF group were also significantly higher than those in the repair-alone group. Although neurotization was almost as effective as end-to-end nerve repair for reinnervating muscle, LIF had no increased effect on neurotization. These data suggest that LIF protects muscular function and reduces denervation atrophy following end-to-end nerve repair.","['Leong, J', 'Hayes, A', 'Austin, L', 'Morrison, W']","['Leong J', 'Hayes A', 'Austin L', 'Morrison W']","[""Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery, St Vincent's Hospital, Department of Neurosciences, The University of Melbourne, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Hand Surg Am,The Journal of hand surgery,7609631,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Hindlimb', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infusion Pumps', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*innervation/pathology/physiopathology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Nerve Regeneration', 'Nerve Transfer', 'Osmosis', 'Peripheral Nerves/physiology/*surgery', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0363-5023(99)27831-8 [pii]', '10.1053/jhsu.1999.jhsy24a0037 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hand Surg Am. 1999 Jan;24(1):37-45. doi: 10.1053/jhsu.1999.jhsy24a0037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined cytokine-stimulated survival of constitutively growth factor-dependent acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived cell lines. The cells from the four cell lines MUTZ-2 (AML M2-derived), OCI/AML5 (AML M4), TF-1 (AML M6) and UT-7 (AML M7) undergo apoptosis quickly in the absence of cytokines in serum-free medium: half-lives of serum- and factor-deprived cells ranged from 14 to 64 h. Here, we analyzed the survival-promoting and apoptosis-inhibiting properties of FLT3 ligand (FL) using the viable cell count as an indicator of programmed cell death. The receptor for FL belongs to the class III family of receptor tyrosine kinases which also includes c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF). FL extended the survival of cell lines MUTZ-2 and OCI/AML5, but was not effective for cell lines TF-1 and UT-7. In OCI/AML5, the action of FL was evident both in first promoting survival and then stimulating proliferation slightly. In MUTZ-2, depending on the concentration used, FL extended survival by 64-135% compared with control cells. SCF alone prolonged cell survival of MUTZ-2 as well, however, FL and the combination of FL+SCF was significantly more active. Thus, FL alone, and in combination with SCF, was active in promoting survival and proliferation of human AML cells in vitro.","['Meyer, C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Meyer C', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures Braunschweig.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909058416 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Feb;32(5-6):577-81. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058416.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular biology of chronic leukemias and lymphomas remains largely unresolved. Surface immunoglobulin (Ig) expression, which is often decreased in CLL, requires the protein product of the B29 gene for translocation of the B cell antigen receptor complex (BCR) to the cell surface and for signal transduction. Because B29 is essential for intracellular assembly and transport of the B cell antigen receptor complex to the cell surface, we postulate that a perturbation in B29 could result in the diminished expression and function of surface Ig in leukemic CLL cells. We have found recurrent aberrations affecting the B29 gene in CLL cells. Analyses of 27 unselected cases of CLL demonstrate that over 75% had low to absent B29 expression which correlated directly to their level of surface Ig expression. Half of these surface B29(low/-) cases had either no or barely detectable levels of B29 mRNA by RNAse protection assay. To date, all of the CLL samples with normal B29 mRNA levels have been found to have point mutations or truncations which would significantly effect the structure and/or function of B29 protein. Strategies directed at correcting these B29 mutations are expected to induce increased Ig surface expression in CLL and may improve the sensitivity of CLL cells to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.","['Thompson, A A', 'Do, H N', 'Saxon, A', 'Wall, R']","['Thompson AA', 'Do HN', 'Saxon A', 'Wall R']","['Dept. of Pediatrics, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909058414 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Feb;32(5-6):561-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058414.,"['CA12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM40185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematopoietic cells, expression of the EMT gene was associated with T-cell fractions, but Emt was not detected in cord blood CD34+ cells. In fetal tissues, Emt mRNA was strongly expressed in thymus, no expression could be detected in non-hematopoietic tissues. The expression pattern of the 48 malignant bone marrow samples (23 ALL, 1 PLL, 9 AML, 7 CLL and 8 CML cases) paralleled the findings from normal hematopoietic cells: 9/11 T cell associated ALLs, as well as one T-PLL sample, but only 1/12 samples of B-ALL expressed Emt markedly. Only minor signs of Emt expression could be shown in the AML samples, while CML and CLL samples were totally devoid of expression. In addition the Emt protein could be detected by Western blotting from T-lymphocytes and T-cell associated ALL, corresponding to mRNA expression. In conclusion, Emt (Itk) is T-cell associated both in normal and leukemic cells, but is not expressed in cord blood CD34+ cells, suggesting that Emt expression is switched on only later in T-cell development.

This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of brain irradiation in reversing the cranial nerve palsies in leukemic patients with no radiological evidence of intracranial leukemic infiltration. Records of leukemic patients who received brain radiotherapy between June 1980 and December 1993 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion were 1) no evidence of intracranial leukemic infiltration by computed axial tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI), 2) no evidence of leukemic infiltration on ophthalmologic examination, and 3) no previous radiotherapy to the brain. Actuarial survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare responses. Twenty-eight patients met these criteria. The median age was 38 years (range 3-75 years): Seventeen patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, nine had acute myelogenous leukemia, and two had chronic myelogenous leukemia. Four patients had initial presentation with leukemia, and 24 presented with relapse. Twenty-six patients had cerebrospinal fluid cytology that was positive for leukemic cells. Fifteen patients had involvement of more than one cranial nerve, and nine had bilateral involvement. The most commonly involved nerves were the facial (n = 18), oculomotor (n = 9), and abducens nerves (n = 8). Twenty-six patients received whole-brain radiotherapy. Two received radiation to the base of the skull only. The median radiation dose was 24 Gy (range 16-30 Gy) at 2-3 Gy per fraction. Every patient had either concomitant intrathecal (n = 6) or systemic (n = 5) chemotherapy or both (n = 17) with radiation. Fourteen patients had complete reversal of the cranial nerve deficit, eight had partial recovery, and four had no response or progression of the disease. The response was unknown in two patients.

Previously, we demonstrated that human leukemic cell growth in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse was a significant prognostic factor for very high risk B-lineage ALL patients. In the current report we show that primary leukemic cells from 24 of 88 (27%) T-lineage ALL patients (SCID+) caused histopathologically detectable leukemia in SCID mice. These SCID+ patients were similar to SCID- (n = 64) patients with respect to virtually all presenting features, including age, sex, race, and leukocyte count. Growth of primary leukemic cells in SCID mice was not a significant predictor of outcome for the aggregate population of T-lineage ALL patients. Two-year event-free survival (EFS) outcomes for SCID+ patient and SCID- patients were 76.2% (SD = 5.6%) and a 64.0% (SD = 10.4%; p = 0.20). Overall survival also was similar between the two groups (p = 0.36). Among the subset of patients with M1 or M2 marrow status by day 7 of induction chemotherapy (rapid early responders), those who were SCID+ had poorer outcomes than those who were SCID-, with a 2-year EFS of 68.4% (SD = 11.9%) vs. 85.7% (SD = 6.0%) and relative hazard rate of 3.06 (p = 0.06).

Its most intriguing and well characterized function is its ability to catalyze the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD. cADPR serves as an important second messenger in controlling the release of intracellular calcium from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular pools. By virtue of its ability to synthesize cADPR as well as to act as an adhesion and signal transduction molecule, CD38 may play a role in such diverse physiological processes as cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and inflammation. Equally interesting is the pattern of CD38 expression in hematopoietic cells. In the bone marrow, early precursor cells predominantly express CD38 antigen, whereas mature circulating blood cells lack or express very low levels. The expression is also high on malignant hematopoietic cells and thus may be of prognostic relevance in certain leukemias. Presently, there is little information available on the factors that regulate the expression of CD38 antigen in hematopoietic cells. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the regulation of CD38 antigen by retinoids (vitamin A and related compounds). At least in the myeloid cell lineage, retinoids appear to be exquisitely potent and specific inducers of CD38 antigen expression, and retinoid-induced expression of CD38 is mediated via activation of the retinoic acid-alpha (RAR alpha) nuclear receptor.","['Mehta, K', 'Cheema, S']","['Mehta K', 'Cheema S']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. kmehta@mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*biosynthesis', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology']",65,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909058401 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Feb;32(5-6):441-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058401.,['FDR-000923/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently it has become apparent that CD44 antibodies cannot only inhibit CD44 mediated adhesion to hyaluronic acid and cellular ligands but can stimulate adhesion to these ligands. The mechanism involved in CD44 antibody stimulated adhesion to cellular layers is still not known. While adhesion of T cells to keratinocytes is integrin mediated it appears that adhesion of hematopoietic progenitors to bone marrow stromal layers is the result of an antibody induced conformational change in the CD44 molecule similar to that seem for the augmentation of hyaluronic acid binding by some CD44 antibodies.

Since proliferation rates are low in the mature pulmonary epithelium, we tested the hypothesis that the efficiency of retrovirus-mediated transduction of respiratory epithelial cells can be enhanced by stimulation of cell proliferation with recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (rhKGF). A marked increase in proliferation of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells was observed after intratracheal administration of rhKGF (30 mg/kg) to adult FVB/N mice. Two days after rhKGF or saline treatment, 10(7) AP+ FFU of LAPSN, a recombinant amphotropic retrovirus that expresses human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP), was instilled intratracheally into the mice. Transduction efficiency, measured 2 days after infection, was increased approximately 70-fold by rhKGF pretreatment. However, even after KGF treatment the total numbers of AP-expressing cells were few. Transduction efficiency was similar using either LAPSN packaged by amphotropic host range packaging cells or LAPSN pseudotyped with 10A1 MuLV envelope protein (0.091 +/- 0.006 versus 0.094 +/- 0.028 transduction events/mm2, respectively). Amphotropic vectors use Pit-2 for cell entry, while 10A1 MuLV vectors can use Pit-1 or Pit-2 for cell entry. By in situ hybridization the retroviral receptor Pit-2 (Ram-1) mRNA was expressed only in the pulmonary vasculature, and Pit-1 (Glvr-1) mRNA was expressed at low levels throughout the lung. In vitro studies demonstrated that retrovirus was inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Stimulating proliferation of the respiratory epithelium increased retroviral transduction in vivo, but the paucity of retroviral receptors and inactivation by surfactant are additional barriers to high-level retroviral gene transfer in the lung.","['Zsengeller, Z K', 'Halbert, C', 'Miller, A D', 'Wert, S E', 'Whitsett, J A', 'Bachurski, C J']","['Zsengeller ZK', 'Halbert C', 'Miller AD', 'Wert SE', 'Whitsett JA', 'Bachurski CJ']","[""Division of Pulmonary Biology, Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Fgf7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 10)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (POU1F1 protein, human)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Pit1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchi/*drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelium/anatomy & histology/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 10', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7', '*Fibroblast Growth Factors', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950018797 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Feb 10;10(3):341-53. doi: 10.1089/10430349950018797.,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL51832/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most types of malignant cells accumulate substantially more ALA-induced PpIX than do the normal cells from which they arose. Most types of malignant cells also are less differentiated than their normal counterparts. We therefore considered the possibility that malignant cells demonstrate a malignant ALA phenotype (accumulate abnormally large amounts of PpIX when exposed to exogenous ALA) as a direct consequence of their less differentiated state. Human promyelocyte cell line HL-60 and mouse preadipocyte cell line 3T3 L1 were induced to differentiate by exposing them to inducing agents in vitro. The HL-60 cells accumulated less ALA-induced PpIX when differentiated, but the 3T3 L1 cells accumulated more. It appears then that changes in the ALA phenotype with changes in the state of differentiation are cell-type specific. The decreased accumulation of ALA-induced PpIX that accompanied differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cells may have clinical application for rapid quantitation of the response of myelocytic leukemia patients to differentiation therapy.","['Li, G', 'Szewczuk, M R', 'Pottier, R H', 'Kennedy, J C']","['Li G', 'Szewczuk MR', 'Pottier RH', 'Kennedy JC']","[""Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada. dengkel@rocketmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/drug effects', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1999 Feb;69(2):231-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD437-mediated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and apoptosis of HL-60R cells does not require gene transcription or protein synthesis since it occurs in the presence or absence of either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Marked activation of both the p38 and the JNK/SAPK serine and threonine kinases occurs at 1 h of exposure to CD437 with subsequent PARP cleavage at 2 h and apoptosis noted at 4 to 6 h. CD437 concentrations as little as 10 nM result in p38 activation and apoptosis of HL-60R cells. However, inhibition of p38 activation utilizing the specific inhibitor SB203580 does not block CD437-mediated PARP cleavage or apoptosis. In addition, p38 activation is dependent upon the activation of the caspase system since p38 activation is blocked by the pan ICE inhibitor Z-VAD fmk, which also inhibits CD437-mediated apoptosis and PARP cleavage in these cells. CD437-mediated activation of JNK/SAPK is not inhibited by Z-VAD fmk, suggesting that it lies upstream of CD437 activation of caspase activity and subsequent apoptosis. The role of JNK/SAPK activation in CD437-mediated apoptosis remains to be defined.","['Zhang, Y', 'Huang, Y', 'Rishi, A K', 'Sheikh, M S', 'Shroot, B', 'Reichert, U', 'Dawson, M', 'Poirer, G', 'Fontana, J A']","['Zhang Y', 'Huang Y', 'Rishi AK', 'Sheikh MS', 'Shroot B', 'Reichert U', 'Dawson M', 'Poirer G', 'Fontana JA']","['Department of Medicine and Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, 48201-1932, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (CD 437)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoids)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94350-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4350 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Feb 25;247(1):233-40. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4350.,"['CA63335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA51993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have conducted different experiments by FCM using whole cells and isolated nuclei to study the immunolocalization and kinetic patterns of cyclin B1 and cyclin E in various leukemic cell lines. During asynchronous growth, all whole cells had a scheduled, cell cycle phase-restricted expression of cyclin B1. By using a washless immunostaining of unfixed nuclei, cyclin B1 was detected in all cell cycle phases, including G1, although to a lesser extent than in G2/M, suggesting that in whole cells the cyclin B1 epitope is masked and accessible only in isolated nuclei. When the cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by thymidine or in the G1 phase by sodium n-butyrate, an identical accumulation of cyclin B1 was observed. As for cyclin E, its expression was higher with thymidine treatment than with sodium n-butyrate, particularly in nuclei. The elevated cyclin B1 level in the cells arrested at the G1/S boundary may reflect the increased half-life of this protein stabilized as the result of cyclin E overexpression. However, our FCM data also support the notion that accumulation of human cyclin B1 in leukemic cell lines begins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, probably in the nucleus. The detection of cyclin B1 by Western blot in cells sorted in the G1 phase of the cell cycle confirms this finding. It is possible, therefore, that tumor transformation or leukemic phenotype may invariably be associated with altered cyclin B1 expression.","['Viallard, J F', 'Lacombe, F', 'Dupouy, M', 'Ferry, H', 'Belloc, F', 'Reiffers, J']","['Viallard JF', 'Lacombe F', 'Dupouy M', 'Ferry H', 'Belloc F', 'Reiffers J']","['Laboratoire de Greffe de Moelle, UMR-CNRS 5540, 146 rue Leo Saignat, Bordeaux, 33076, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclin E)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclin B/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclin E/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/02/27 00:00,1999/02/27 00:01,['1999/02/27 00:00'],"['1999/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94352-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4352 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Feb 25;247(1):208-19. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4352.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fe chelate, sodium Fe(III)EDTA was positive in both the presence and absence of S9. The lowest effective doses (LED) for induction of mutagenicity were identified for these compounds and an LED ratio calculated. The LED ratio ranges from 1 for FeSO4 to 30 for carbonyl Fe, which are similar to oral LD50 values obtained in animal studies.","['Dunkel, V C', 'San, R H', 'Seifried, H E', 'Whittaker, P']","['Dunkel VC', 'San RH', 'Seifried HE', 'Whittaker P']","['Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC 20204, USA.

The disease was aggressive and refractory to intensive chemotherapeutic regimens for myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, and the patient died 3 months after the initial presentation. The leukemic cells were of irregular shape and variable size; they had deeply indented or bi-lobed nuclei and relatively fine, azurophilic granules in their cytoplasm. They were positive for acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase in granular staining, but they were negative for myeloperoxidase. The leukemic cells had a unique immunophenotype: it was positive for T-cell antigens (CD1a, CD2, cytoplasmic CD3, CD4), myeloid antigens (CD13 and CD33), NK-cell antigen (CD56), CD19 and CD30. DNA analysis revealed no gene rearrangement in the T-cell receptor beta, gamma and delta, or immunoglobulin heavy chain genes.

Fab-displayed phage clones were screened by a direct ELISA, and the single positive clone was finally obtained. Although the reaction pattern of rFab against pseudouridine and uridine was almost identical to that of MoAb, detection sensitivity of rFab was approximately 30 times higher than that of MoAb. Since the sensitivity of rFab was almost identical to that of Fab fragment prepared by papain digestion of MoAb, the increased sensitivity is considered to be the nature of Fab fragment.

To study cross-resistance among inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase, we developed hydroxyurea-resistant (HU-R) CCRF-CEM cells. These cells were 6-fold more resistant to hydroxyurea than the parent hydroxyurea-sensitive (HU-S) cell line and displayed an increase in the mRNA and protein of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. We examined whether HU-R cells were cross-resistant to gemcitabine, a drug that blocks cell proliferation by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and incorporating itself into DNA. Contrary to our expectation, HU-R cells had an increased sensitivity to gemcitabine. The IC50 of gemcitabine was 0.061 +/- 0.03 microM for HU-R cells versus 0.16 +/- 0.02 microM for HU-S cells (P = 0.005). The cellular uptake of [3H]gemcitabine and its incorporation into DNA were increased in HU-R cells. Over an 18-h incubation with radiolabeled gemcitabine (0.25 microM), gemcitabine uptake was 286 +/- 37.3 fmol/10(6) cells for HU-R cells and 128 +/- 8.8 fmol/10(6) cells for HU-S cells (P = 0.03). The incorporation of gemcitabine into DNA was 75 +/- 6.7 fmol/10(6) cells for HU-R cells versus 22 +/- 0.6 fmol/10(6) cells for HU-S cells (P < 0.02). Our studies suggest that the increased sensitivity of HU-R cells to gemcitabine results from increased drug uptake by these cells. This, in turn, favors the incorporation of gemcitabine into DNA, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity. The increased sensitivity of malignant cells to gemcitabine after the development of hydroxyurea resistance may be relevant to the design of chemotherapeutic trials with these drugs.","['Wong, S J', 'Myette, M S', 'Wereley, J P', 'Chitambar, C R']","['Wong SJ', 'Myette MS', 'Wereley JP', 'Chitambar CR']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Feb;5(2):439-43.,['R01 CA68028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred forty patients (82 males) aged 4 to 27 years (median, 11) diagnosed with ALL between 1976 and 1993, were prospectively followed for a median of 5 years (range, 0.1-17) after completion of therapy. Stored sera were tested for antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV), HCV RNA, antibody to GBV-C E2 (anti-E2), and GBV-C RNA. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (27%) were exposed to GBV-C: 30 were positive for GBV-C RNA (mostly type 2) and 8 were positive for anti-E2. Anti-E2 and GBV-C RNA were mutually exclusive: 61 patients (43%) were positive for HCV RNA, 16 (11%) were coinfected with GBV-C and HCV. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were increased (>35 mU/mL) in 32 (23%) of 137: 3 of 20 who were positive for GBV-C and negative for HCV, 7 of 15 who were positive for GBV-C and HCV, 15 of 44 who were negative for GBV-C and positive for HCV, and 7 of 58 who were negative for GBV-C and HCV (p<0.001). Median ALT values were significantly higher in patients positive for GBV-C and HCV than in those who were positive for GBV-C and negative for HCV (35 vs. 13 mU/mL, p = 0.003). Thirty-one of 38 patients with GBV-C markers were retested: GBV-C RNA was lost in 16 of 30 tested, but 7 were still GBV-C RNA positive up to 50 months later, 3 tested positive for anti-E2 up to 27 months later, and 1 was positive for GBV-C RNA and anti-E2 26 months later, while 20 tested negative for both. CONCLUSION: GBV-C did not behave as a liver pathogen, because ALT alterations were unrelated to GBV-C status, but, rather, were related to HCV infection or coinfection. GBV-C RNA was frequently lost over a relatively short period, though in some cases, it was retained for a longer time. Anti-E2 rarely coexisted with GBV-C RNA and might be short-term.","['Arico, M', 'Bissolati, M', 'Bossi, G', 'Asti, M', 'Cerino, A', 'Caselli, D', 'Ricci, A', 'Klersy, C', 'Silini, E', 'Mondelli, M U']","['Arico M', 'Bissolati M', 'Bossi G', 'Asti M', 'Cerino A', 'Caselli D', 'Ricci A', 'Klersy C', 'Silini E', 'Mondelli MU']","['Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flaviviridae/*isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis C/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39299154738.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1999 Feb;39(2):212-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39299154738.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 292 allogeneic transplant recipients measured survival in a subgroup of ABO-incompatible bone marrow graft recipients. RESULTS: Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow grafts had an 85-percent greater risk of death within 100 days of transplant (relative risk, 1.85, 95% CI, 1.33-2.58; p = 0.003) than comparable patients receiving ABO-compatible grafts. Both ABO major- and minor-mismatched graft recipients were at risk. The increased mortality rate was not due to an increase in graft failure or acute graft-versus-host disease; rather, patients died of multiple-organ failure and sepsis, which is consistent with regimen-related toxicity. This effect was not seen in a larger group of 112 chronic myelogenous leukemia patients undergoing similar treatment. CONCLUSION: ABO incompatibility may be a significant prognostic risk factor after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in susceptible subgroups of recipients. Care is necessary to design hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-processing and -transfusion policies to minimize this risk.","['Benjamin, R J', 'McGurk, S', 'Ralston, M S', 'Churchill, W H', 'Antin, J H']","['Benjamin RJ', 'McGurk S', 'Ralston MS', 'Churchill WH', 'Antin JH']","['Dana Farber/Partners Cancer Care, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/02/26 03:04,2000/03/18 09:00,['1999/02/26 03:04'],"['1999/02/26 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/26 03:04 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39299154733.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1999 Feb;39(2):179-87. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39299154733.x.,,,,,,['Transfusion. 1999 Nov-Dec;39(11-12):1273-4.

In 67 patients treated by intravenous remission induction therapy we found that patients who after the first induction cycle or after induction therapy overall achieved a complete remission (CR) had leukaemia cells with significantly lower in vitro cell survival ability than cells of non-responders (p = 0.02 and 0.06, respectively). These relations remained statistically significant in subsequent multivariate analyses. Likewise, a favourable effect of low in vitro leukaemia cell survival on overall survival of the patients was detected in the (largest) subgroup of adult patients treated uniformly by the same remission induction regimen as well as in all patients. However, in the 44 patients, who achieved CR, the in vitro leukaemia cell survival did not show significance to remission duration or time to first relapse. Furthermore, the leukaemia cell survival (MTT-assay) did not to correlate with the Bcl-2 expression level (quantitative flow cytometry) of the leukaemia cells (r = 0.18, n = 34, p = 0.32). In addition, in a cell line model employing the growth factor dependent MO7 human AML cell line, growth factor withdrawal was associated with rapid onset of cellular apoptosis as evaluated by morphology, occurrence of a subG1 peak in DNA histograms, and loss of cellular activity in the MTT-assay. In contrast, a more moderate decline in Bcl-2 expression and gradual loss of ability to exclude the trypan blue dye was seen in the leukaemia cells in response to growth factor withdrawal. We conclude, that the MTT-assay provides a simple and sensitive method for measuring in vitro cell survival.

In view of this we decided to follow a cohort of CP CML patients to determine the frequency with which abnormal IgH fingerprints are found and their relationship, if any, to treatment regimen. Thirty three, initially CP, CML patients were studied on 111 occasions over a 16 month period using consensus PCR amplification of the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) of the IgH gene and high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (IgH DNA fingerprinting). Of these 33 patients, thirteen received interferon-alpha (IFN) containing regimens and 15 non-IFN containing regimens throughout the study period. Five patients received variable therapy. During the period of observation 7 patients experienced disease progression: 5 accelerated phase, I L-BC and I myeloid blast crisis (M-BC). Abnormal IgH fingerprints were seen in 29 of the 111 (26%) specimens analysed. The 28 patients who received uniform therapy (IFN or non-IFN) over the 16 months were classified as ""normal"" (n = 18, normal pattern on all occasions) or ""abnormal"" (n = 10, abnormal on 1 or more occasions). Analysis by patient group (normal vs abnormal) showed that fingerprint abnormalities were associated with an elevated peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p = 0.0001) but not with changes in the total white cell count. Comparison of the IFN vs. non-IFN groups showed the former all had normal patterns whereas 10 of 15 non-IFN therapy patients were abnormal (p = 0.00023). The peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in the normal vs abnormal patients within the non-IFN group were not significantly different. The patient who developed L-BC demonstrated a persistent IgH fingerprint pattern abnormality from 7 months prior to the diagnosis of L-BC. The M-BC patient had a normal pattern at all times. We conclude that: (1) abnormal IgH fingerprints are found in a significant number of CP CML patients; (2) in this cohort the use of IFN was associated with normal CP CML IgH fingerprints, and (3) detection of abnormal IgH fingerprints may be highly predictive for the lineage of impending blast crisis.","['Spencer, A', 'Szydlo, R', 'Grand, F H', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Spencer A', 'Szydlo R', 'Grand FH', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Haematology Department, Mater Hospital, Newcastle, Australia. andrewspencer@hunterlink.net.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['*DNA Fingerprinting', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics/*immunology/therapy']",,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909167390 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jan;32(3-4):299-307. doi: 10.3109/10428199909167390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wild type Jak3 was able to tyrosine phosphorylate a kinase-dead Jak1 (Jak1E908). In contrast wild type Jak1 was unable to tyrosine phosphorylate kinase dead Jak3 (Jak3E851). This unilateral transphosphorylation between Jak3 and Jak1 prompts the hypothesis that in the IL2R system the activation of Jak3 precedes Jak1 activation. Both the IL2Rbeta and IL2Rgammac subunits underwent tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed with wild-type Jak3. By comparison only IL2Rbeta was recognized and tyrosine phosphorylated by wild-type Jak1. These results are consistent with the notion that Jakl is pre-associated with IL2Rbeta and Jak3 is pre-associated with IL2Rgammac. STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed with Jakl and therefore are substrates for the respective Jak kinases. In contrast, Jak3 co-expression resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 but not STAT1. Notably a polypeptide representing the kinase domain of Jak3 (Jak3-JH1) gained the ability to tyrosine phosphorylate STAT1, suggesting that the changes in substrate recognition may be influenced by domains outside the kinase domain. These findings provide evidence that Jak1 and Jak3 differentially recognize specific substrates, thereby having the ability to contribute specific signals, and the substrate specificity may be influenced by multiple domains of these tyrosine kinases.","['Witthuhn, B A', 'Williams, M D', 'Kerawalla, H', 'Uckun, F M']","['Witthuhn BA', 'Williams MD', 'Kerawalla H', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wayne Hughes Institute, Roseville, MN 55113, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Insecta', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909167389 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jan;32(3-4):289-97. doi: 10.3109/10428199909167389.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of basophilic granules, some cases are classified as AML M0 if they express myeloid markers, or undifferentiated leukemia if no markers are present. If specific immature basophilic or theta granules are present, only an electron microscopic study will enable the diagnosis of a basophilic lineage assignment. Some cases may be misdiagnosed if all these steps are not followed. After all these investigations, two types of ABL may be defined: 1-A pure ABL, monophenotypic with basophilic lineage involvement alone, which should be classified as AML M8 . Genetic studies in these cases are very important for understanding the leukemic process and in a few cases, we can suspect c-MYB oncogene involvement but further investigations are still necessary. 2- More frequently, acute leukemia can be a mixture of blasts from different lineages with an important but variable participation of mature or immature basophilic cells.

HGF is cytoprotective and causes regeneration of parenchyma after tissue damage in several organs. The receptor c-Met was first characterized as an oncogene product being responsible for the transformation of an osteosarcoma cell line. HGF or c-Met is overexpressed in several human cancers, including various carcinomas. Some cells of hematopoietic origin also seem to be capable of c-Met expression, but the precise role of HGF in normal hematopoiesis is yet to be determined. In blood malignancies like acute myelogenous leukemia and, notably, multiple myeloma, HGF is overproduced and has implications for the prognosis of the patients. Biological significance of HGF overexpression in multiple myeloma is discussed and is likely to include effects on bone turnover and angiogenesis.","['Borset, M', 'Seidel, C', 'Hjorth-Hansen, H', 'Waage, A', 'Sundan, A']","['Borset M', 'Seidel C', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Waage A', 'Sundan A']","['The Institute of Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, University Hospital Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim. magne.borset@medisin.ntnu.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*physiology']",60,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909167385 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jan;32(3-4):249-56. doi: 10.3109/10428199909167385.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neutrophil level of 1.0 x 10(9)/l was usually reached after two weeks. The initial dose of GM-CSF was 5 microg/kg/day, and 1-7 microg/kg/day was required to maintain the neutrophil level above 1.0 x 10(9)/l. Granulocyte functions, i.e. chemiluminescence (CL), random migration, and fMLP-stimulated chemotaxis were initially depressed in all patients when compared to healthy controls. GM-CSF enhanced significantly CL even when given at small doses (less than 1 microg/kg/day), even lower than the dose required to promote granulopoiesis.

Since normal early progenitor or stem cells persist in the blood and bone marrow of patients with Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), the selection of normal (Ph-negative) progenitor cells from CML patients would be of considerable clinical value for ex vivo purging and autologous transplantation. To obtain these cells, CD34-positive (progenitor) cells from the peripheral blood (PB) of CML patients were either pretreated or not with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and then grown in suspension culture for 7 days with a combination of cytokines. We compared different combinations of cytokines containing interleukin-1 alpha (IL1), interleukin-3 (IL3), stem cell factor (SCF), leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF), Flt3-ligand (FLT3L), and thrombopoietin (TPO). 5FU decreased cell proliferation in the liquid culture but concurrently increased the expansion of CFU-GM. While the addition of cytokines such as FLT3L and TPO improved CFU-GM expansion. FISH and RT-PCR analysis showed that this method significantly favored a higher frequency of Ph-negative cells after expansion in liquid culture. Therefore ex vivo expansion of putatively normal hematopoietic progenitor cells from cytapheresis is feasible in CML.","['Mahon, F X', 'Pigeonnier-Lagarde, V', 'Chahine, H', 'Maguer-Satta, V', 'Ripoche, J', 'Reiffers, J']","['Mahon FX', 'Pigeonnier-Lagarde V', 'Chahine H', 'Maguer-Satta V', 'Ripoche J', 'Reiffers J']","['Laboratoire de Greffe de Moelle, UMR CNRS 5540, FR60, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, France.

It is possible that the detection of MRD at a specific time-point after diagnosis, as well as at the beginning of maintenance, may help to identify a group of T-ALL patients at high risk of relapse. The correlation between detection of MRD and treatment phase may be used in the future to evaluate whether treatment regimens can be improved allowing for stratification, based on PCR-mediated detection of MRD.","['Dibenedetto, S P', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Di Cataldo, A', 'Schiliro, G']","['Dibenedetto SP', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Schiliro G']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta/genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor delta/genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",73,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059247 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Dec;32(1-2):65-75. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059247.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma membrane permeation of the nucleoside analog molecules, the initial event in the cellular conversion of nucleosides to active agents, is mediated by nucleoside-specific membrane transporters. The widely-expressed es nucleoside transporter accepts as substrates diverse nucleoside analogs, including cytarabine (araC), 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and fludarabine. The cellular content of es transporter sites has been measured in blasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, by a sensitive, quantitative flow cytometry assay that employs the tightly-bound es ligand, SAENTA fluorescein. Values for es transporter expression varied ten-fold among samples from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. In this article, we review current findings that document, in confocal fluorescence microscopy images and in flow cytometry assays of SAENTA fluorescein-stained cells, the patient-to-patient variance of es transporter expression in leukemic blasts from patients. Our data show a correlation between the expression of es transporters and the in vitro sensitivity to nucleoside drugs of blasts from acute leukemia patients. These findings show that the flow cytometry assay of es expression provides a facile means of predicting resistance of leukemia cells to the cytotoxicity of araC and other nucleosides.","['Gati, W P', 'Paterson, A R', 'Belch, A R', 'Chlumecky, V', 'Larratt, L M', 'Mant, M J', 'Turner, A R']","['Gati WP', 'Paterson AR', 'Belch AR', 'Chlumecky V', 'Larratt LM', 'Mant MJ', 'Turner AR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147395-08-2 (5-(SAENTA-x8)fluorescein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides/metabolism']",44,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059245 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Dec;32(1-2):45-54. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 13 out of 105 Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus (MuLV) induced leukemias retroviral integrations occured either in the 5' or 3' part of the Cb2 gene. The Cb2 receptor protein is 44% homologous to the central cannabinoid receptor Cb1, which belongs to the superfamily of seven transmembrane (7TM) receptors. Cb1 is mainly expressed in brain, whereas Cb2 encodes the hematopoietic form. Besides the natural cannabinoids, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) and cannabinol, and the many synthetic agonists that have been generated, e.g CP55,940 or WIN55,212-2, several endogenous ligands have recently been identified. These include the arachidonic acid derivatives anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol as well as the fatty acid palmitoylethanolamide. Although in the past many studies described growth inhibitory effects of cannabinoid agonists on the in vitro proliferation of hematopoietic cells, recent studies demonstrated that activation of Cb2 may have growth stimulatory effects on blood precursor cells. We demonstrated that many murine hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) dependent cell lines also require the presence of anandamide for optimal growth in serum free culture. Thus, the Cb2 receptor may be an important regulator of normal hematopoietic growth and development. These results strengthen our finding that Cb2 is a proto-oncogene and may implicate a growth advantage for leukemia cells that aberrantly express Cb2. Here we briefly review the mechanisms and application of retroviral insertional mutagenesis in leukemic transformation in mice and discuss the role of the peripheral cannabinoid receptor in leukemia development and normal hematopoiesis.","['Valk, P J', 'Delwel, R']","['Valk PJ', 'Delwel R']","['Erasmus University, Institute of Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cannabinoids/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid', 'Receptors, Drug/agonists/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",108,1999/02/26 00:00,1999/02/26 00:01,['1999/02/26 00:00'],"['1999/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059244 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Dec;32(1-2):29-43. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059244.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MDS, the p15INK4B gene is also frequently hypermethylated at the promoter region located at the 5'-CpG island of exon 1. Association of frequent and strong methylation with high-risk MDS suggested that promoter methylation of the p15INK4B gene plays an important role as a late event during MDS progression.

The same chromosomal region is also a target for deletions in certain solid tumors. As an initial step toward the cloning of a potential tumor suppressor gene at 12p12.3, we mapped the ETV6-CDKN1B region physically using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and P1-derived clone (PAC) contigs. The 1.2-Mb high-resolution, contiguous map extends from D12S1095 to D12S929 and consists of 19 PACs and 20 BACs. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis experiments confirmed the integrity of the clone-based map and identified six CpG islands in the region. A transcript map was generated by performing hybridization selection experiments with the genomic clones, by evaluating known 12p ESTs for their presence in the contig, and by sequence analysis of CpG islands in the region. Altogether evidence was gathered for the presence of the recently published LRP6 gene and at least seven other new genes in this chromosomal region. The CLAPS3 gene, mapped between D12S391 and D12S358, was reassigned to chromosome 5 since genomic sequencing demonstrated the chromosome 12p sequence to be a pseudogene. Polymorphic CA repeats were identified approximately every 100 kb, which will support future analysis of loss of heterozygosity in tumors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of leukemia patients with del(12p) further refined the commonly deleted segment to 600 kb between ETV6 and D12S358, which apparently excludes CDKN1B. Methylation changes of the CpG islands in the ETV6-CDKN1B interval were assessed by Southern analysis for leukemia patients with hemizygous 12p deletions. A ""de novo"" methylation was detected only at the LRP6 CpG island in 2 of 22 leukemia patients tested and was confirmed by methylation-sensitive PCR and sequencing. The genomic structure of LRP6 was elucidated to allow screening for inactivating mutations, but only intragenic polymorphisms were identified. Hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with gene promoters is reported as a common mechanism for gene silencing and tumor suppressor inactivation.

RESULTS: Of 158 FSWs studied, all were negative for HIV-1, 6 were positive for HTLV-I, and 5 were positive for Treponema pallidum. Of their male clients, 75% used condoms, whereas only 3% reported condom use with their steady partners. When condoms were always used by clients, the history of a sexually transmitted disease was significantly reduced (p < 0.01), and the prevalence of HTLV-I (p < 0.05) and syphilis was lower among these workers.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A newborn boy was found to have an elevated white blood cell count of 120,800 with 33% blasts. The peripheral blood also contained elevated numbers of basophils and neutrophils with unusual staining properties. The blasts, evaluated by flow cytometry and light and electron microscopy, had the properties of megakaryoblasts. Cytogenetic studies revealed 46,XY karyotype in peripheral blood lymphocytes; however, analysis of the blast cells from the bone marrow showed an abnormal chromosome 21. RESULTS: The blast cells in the peripheral blood disappeared by day 42 without chemotherapy. The red blood cell count and platelet count normalized by 2 months. Chromosomal analysis of skin fibroblasts and bone marrow after the disappearance of the blast cells in the peripheral blood showed a 46,XY phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The leukemic cell of transient leukemia has the potential of forming cells of basophil and megakaryocyte lineages.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifty-one patients were randomized to receive 1 of 3 asparaginase preparations (Escherichia coli, Erwinia chrysanthemi [Erwinia], or pegaspargase). In vitro assessment of efficacy was expressed as the percent total cell kill (TCK), based on the number of viable cells found after 5 days of culture in the presence of asparaginase. In vivo leukemia cell kill (LCK) was calculated by comparing bone marrow cellularity and percent leukemic blasts in marrow obtained before and 5 days after treatment with a single dose of asparaginase. Acute toxicity was determined by clinical and laboratory assessment. RESULTS: There was equivalent cell kill with all three types of asparaginase. The mean in vitro TCKs for E. coli, Erwinia, and pegaspargase were 31%, 39%, and 36%, respectively (P = 0.63). The mean LCKs in marrow of patients exposed to E. coli, Erwinia, and pegaspargase were 69%, 74%, and 65%, respectively (P = 0.88). The lack of response to asparaginase in vitro predicted a higher risk for clinical relapse regardless of risk assignment (12 leukemic events among 21 in vitro nonresponders; 57%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in acute toxicity among the three asparaginase preparations. CONCLUSIONS: All three asparaginase preparations produced equivalent LCKs in in vitro and in vivo analyses. In vitro response to asparaginase provided a risk group-independent prognostic factor.","['Asselin, B L', 'Kreissman, S', 'Coppola, D J', 'Bernal, S D', 'Leavitt, P R', 'Gelber, R D', 'Sallan, S E', 'Cohen, H J']","['Asselin BL', 'Kreissman S', 'Coppola DJ', 'Bernal SD', 'Leavitt PR', 'Gelber RD', 'Sallan SE', 'Cohen HJ']","[""Strong Children's Research Center, University of Rochester, Medical Center, NY 14642, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199901000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1999 Jan-Feb;21(1):6-12. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199901000-00003.,"['00199-03/PHS HHS/United States', '5P01CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA11199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Binet and Rai staging systems distinguish three major prognostic subgroups, but do not accurately predict the individual risk of disease progression in early CLL (Binet stage A or Rai stage 0 to II). Because most newly diagnosed CLL patients present with early disease, it seems desirable to search for additional prognostic factors to identify early CLL patients at high risk of rapid progression. It has been shown that elevated serum thymidine kinase (s-TK) levels predict disease progression in CLL. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prognostic value of s-TK in 122 previously untreated patients with Binet stage A CLL (mean age +/- SD, 58.7 +/- 8.5 years). In univariate analyses, 18 of the 22 parameters investigated predicted progression-free survival (PFS). In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, only three parameters provided independent prognostic information on PFS: s-TK greater than 7.1 U/L; presence of lymphadenopathy; and white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 75, 000/microL. When added to the classification of smoldering versus nonsmoldering CLL, s-TK levels separated two groups within the group of nonsmoldering stage A patients: patients with s-TK values greater than 7.1 U/L had a median PFS of 8 months, whereas patients with s-TK values </= 7.1 U/L expected a much longer PFS (49 months; P <. 001), similar to smoldering CLL (42 months). The results demonstrate that s-TK is a prognostic parameter that adds independent prognostic information to the definitions of smoldering and nonsmoldering CLL in Binet stage A.","['Hallek, M', 'Langenmayer, I', 'Nerl, C', 'Knauf, W', 'Dietzfelbinger, H', 'Adorf, D', 'Ostwald, M', 'Busch, R', 'Kuhn-Hallek, I', 'Thiel, E', 'Emmerich, B']","['Hallek M', 'Langenmayer I', 'Nerl C', 'Knauf W', 'Dietzfelbinger H', 'Adorf D', 'Ostwald M', 'Busch R', 'Kuhn-Hallek I', 'Thiel E', 'Emmerich B']","['Medizinische Klinik, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Klinikum Innenstadt, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48738-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1732-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane-bound HB-EGF retains growth activity and adhesion capabilities and the unique property of being the receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT). The interest in studying HB-EGF in acute leukemia stems from these mitogenic, chemotactic, and receptor functions. We analyzed the expression of HB-EGF in L428, Raji, Jurkat, Karpas 299, L540, 2C8, HL-60, U937, THP-1, ML-3, and K562 cell lines and in primary blasts from 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot and by the evaluation of sensitivity to DT. The release of functional HB-EGF was assessed by evaluation of its proliferative effects on the HB-EGF-sensitive Balb/c 3T3 cell line. HB-EGF was expressed by all myeloid and T, but not B (L428, Raji), lymphoid cell lines tested, as well as by the majority (8 of 12) of ex vivo AML blasts. Cell lines (except for the K562 cell line) and AML blasts expressing HB-EGF mRNA underwent apoptotic death following exposure to DT, thus demonstrating the presence of the HB-EGF molecule on their membrane. Leukemic cells also released a fully functional HB-EGF molecule that was mitogenic for the Balb/c 3T3 cell line. Factors relevant to the biology of leukemic growth, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3, and especially all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), upregulated HB-EGF mRNA in HL-60 or ML-3 cells.

Unlike other activated protein tyrosine kinases associated with hematopoietic malignancies, TEL/PDGFbetaR is invariably associated with a myeloid leukemia phenotype in humans. To test the transforming properties of TEL/PDGFbetaR in vivo, and to analyze the basis for myeloid lineage specificity in humans, we constructed transgenic mice with TEL/PDGFbetaR expression driven by a lymphoid-specific immunoglobulin enhancer-promoter cassette. These mice developed lymphoblastic lymphomas of both T and B lineage, demonstrating that TEL/PDGFbetaR is a transforming protein in vivo, and that the transforming ability of this fusion is not inherently restricted to the myeloid lineage. Treatment of TEL/PDGFbetaR transgenic animals with a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against PDGFbetaR (CGP57148) resulted in suppression of disease and a prolongation of survival. A therapeutic benefit was apparent both in animals treated before the development of overt clonal disease and in animals transplanted with clonal tumor cells. These results suggest that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be effective treatment for activated tyrosine kinase-mediated malignancies both early in the course of disease and after the development of additional transforming mutations.","['Tomasson, M H', 'Williams, I R', 'Hasserjian, R', 'Udomsakdi, C', 'McGrath, S M', 'Schwaller, J', 'Druker, B', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Tomasson MH', 'Williams IR', 'Hasserjian R', 'Udomsakdi C', 'McGrath SM', 'Schwaller J', 'Druker B', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48735-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1707-14.,['P01CA66996-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RHAMM cDNA was cloned and sequenced from the malignant B and plasma cells comprising the myeloma B lineage hierarchy. Three distinct RHAMM gene products, RHAMMFL, RHAMM-48, and RHAMM-147, were cloned from MM B and plasma cells. RHAMMFL was 99% homologous to the published sequence of RHAMM. RHAMM-48 and RHAMM-147 variants align with RHAMMFL, but are characterized by sequence deletions of 48 bp (16 amino acids [aa]) and 147 bp (49 aa), respectively. The relative frequency of these RHAMM transcripts in MM plasma cells was determined by cloning of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products amplified from MM plasma cells. Of 115 randomly picked clones, 49% were RHAMMFL, 47% were RHAMM-48, and 4% were RHAMM-147. All of the detected RHAMM variants contain exon 4, which is alternatively spliced in murine RHAMM, and had only a single copy of the exon 8 repeat sequence detected in murine RHAMM. RT-PCR analysis of sorted blood or BM cells from 22 MM patients showed that overexpression of RHAMM variants is characteristic of MM B cells and BM plasma cells in all patients tested. RHAMM also appeared to be overexpressed in B lymphoma and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In B cells from normal donors, RHAMMFL was only weakly detectable in resting B cells from five of eight normal donors or in chronically activated B cells from three patients with Crohn's disease. RHAMM-48 was detectable in B cells from one of eight normal donors, but was undetectable in B cells of three donors with Crohn's disease. RHAMM-147 was undetectable in normal and Crohn's disease B cells. In situ RT-PCR was used to determine the number of individual cells with aggregate RHAMM transcripts. For six patients, 29% of BM plasma cells and 12% of MM B cells had detectable RHAMM transcripts, while for five normal donors, only 1. 2% of B cells expressed RHAMM transcripts. This work suggests that RHAMMFL, RHAMM-48, and RHAMM-147 splice variants are overexpressed in MM and other B lymphocyte malignancies relative to resting or in vivo-activated B cells, raising the possibility that RHAMM and its variants may contribute to the malignant process in B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma, CLL, and MM.","['Crainie, M', 'Belch, A R', 'Mant, M J', 'Pilarski, L M']","['Crainie M', 'Belch AR', 'Mant MJ', 'Pilarski LM']","['Departments of Oncology and Medicine, University of Alberta and the Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48733-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1684-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the profile of MTX polyglutamylation in childhood c/preB-ALL, T-ALL, and AML (n = 45, 15, and 14, respectively), the activity of the MTX-polyglutamate synthesizing enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) (n = 39, 11, and 19, respectively) and of the MTX-polyglutamate breakdown enzyme folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH) (n = 98, 25, and 34, respectively). MTX-Glu4-6 accumulation after 24 hours exposure to 1 micromol/L [3H]-MTX in vitro was lower in T-ALL (threefold) and AML (fourfold) compared with c/preB-ALL (P </=.001). The FPGS activity was twofold lower in T-ALL and AML than in c/preB-ALL samples (P <. 01). FPGH activity was not different between c/preB-ALL and T-ALL, but threefold higher in AML (P <.001). FPGS, FPGH, and the ratio FPGS/FPGH were correlated with MTX-Glu4-6 accumulation (r =.49, r = -.34 and r =.61, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that FPGS, but not FPGH, was an independent contributor for MTX-Glu1-6 accumulation, but not for MTX-Glu4-6 accumulation. In conclusion, low FPGS activity is associated with low accumulation of MTX-Glu4-6 in T-ALL and AML. For the group of AML as compared with the group of ALL, a high FPGH activity can play an additional role.","['Rots, M G', 'Pieters, R', 'Peters, G J', 'Noordhuis, P', 'van Zantwijk, C H', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Creutzig, U', 'Veerman, A J', 'Jansen, G']","['Rots MG', 'Pieters R', 'Peters GJ', 'Noordhuis P', 'van Zantwijk CH', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Creutzig U', 'Veerman AJ', 'Jansen G']","['Departments of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. marianne.rots@azvu.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Peptide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*metabolism']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48732-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1677-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we studied the expression of the leptin receptor, OB-R, in normal myeloid precursors, human leukemia cell lines, and primary leukemic cells using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In normal hematopoiesis, OB-R was expressed in CD34(+) cells. Normal promyelocytes (CD34(-)33(+) and CD34(-)13(+)) expressed only very low levels of the short, presumably nonsignaling isoform. Both the long and short isoforms of OB-R were expressed in 10 of 22 samples from patients with newly diagnosed primary or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a higher incidence of the long isoform in primary AML (87.6% v 28.6%; P =.01). The incidence of OB-R expression was higher in recurrent than in newly diagnosed AML (P <.001), and samples from four patients with refractory AML showed strong expression of both isoforms. Both OB-R isoforms were also expressed in newly diagnosed and recurrent acute promyelocytic leukemia cells but were essentially absent in samples of chronic or acute lymphocytic leukemia. In vitro growth of myeloid leukemic cell lines and of blasts from 14 primary AMLs demonstrated that recombinant human leptin alone induced low level proliferation, significantly (P <.05) increased proliferation induced by recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and stem cell factor in a subset of AML and increased colony formation (P <.005). Also, leptin reduced apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal in MO7E and TF-1 cells. Serum leptin levels correlated only with body mass index (P <. 001) and gender (P =.03). Results confirm the reported expression of leptin receptor in normal CD34(+) cells and demonstrate the frequent expression of leptin receptors in AML blasts. While normal promyelocytes lack receptor expression, leukemic promyelocytes express both isoforms. We also demonstrate proliferative effects of leptin alone and in combination with other physiologic cytokines, and anti-apoptotic properties of leptin. These findings could have implications for the pathophysiology of AML.","['Konopleva, M', 'Mikhail, A', 'Estrov, Z', 'Zhao, S', 'Harris, D', 'Sanchez-Williams, G', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Dong, J', 'Kliche, K O', 'Jiang, S', 'Snodgrass, H R', 'Estey, E H', 'Andreeff, M']","['Konopleva M', 'Mikhail A', 'Estrov Z', 'Zhao S', 'Harris D', 'Sanchez-Williams G', 'Kornblau SM', 'Dong J', 'Kliche KO', 'Jiang S', 'Snodgrass HR', 'Estey EH', 'Andreeff M']","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Progenitor, Inc, Menlo Park, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leptin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis', 'Proteins/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48731-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1668-76.,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism for higher accumulation of MTX polyglutamates (MTX-PG) in hyperdiploid ALL and lower accumulation in T-lineage ALL, expression of the reduced folate carrier (RFC) was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in ALL blasts isolated from newly diagnosed patients. RFC expression exhibited a 60-fold range among 29 children, with significantly higher expression in hyperdiploid B-lineage ALL (median, 11.3) compared with nonhyperdiploid ALL (median, 2.1; P <.0006), but no significant difference between nonhyperdiploid B-lineage and T-lineage ALL. Furthermore, mRNA levels of RFC (mapped by FISH to chromosome 21) were significantly related to chromosome 21 copy number (P =.0013), with the highest expression in hyperdiploid ALL blasts with 4 copies of chromosome 21. To assess the functional significance of gene copy number, MTX-PG accumulation was compared in ALL blasts isolated from 121 patients treated with either low-dose MTX (LDMTX; n = 60) or high-dose MTX (HDMTX; n = 61). After LDMTX, MTX-PG accumulation was highest in hyperdiploid B-lineage ALL with 4 copies of chromosome 21 (P =.011), but MTX-PG accumulation was not significantly related to chromosome 21 copy number after HDMTX (P =.24). These data show higher RFC expression as a mechanism for greater MTX accumulation in hyperdiploid B-lineage ALL and indicate that lineage differences in MTX-PG accumulation are not due to lower RFC expression in T-lineage ALL.","['Belkov, V M', 'Krynetski, E Y', 'Schuetz, J D', 'Yanishevski, Y', 'Masson, E', 'Mathew, S', 'Raimondi, S', 'Pui, C H', 'Relling, M V', 'Evans, W E']","['Belkov VM', 'Krynetski EY', 'Schuetz JD', 'Yanishevski Y', 'Masson E', 'Mathew S', 'Raimondi S', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; and the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Humans', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Ploidies', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48728-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1643-50.,"['R01 CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients are in major cytogenetic remission at a median of 22 (range, 6 to 48) months. No patient died as a consequence of the treatment. All patients had some degree of stomatitis that was severe in 15 (50%) patients. Gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicities were observed in about one fourth of patients. Thus, autografting with Ph-negative mobilized HPC can result in prolonged restoration of Ph-negative hematopoiesis for some patients with CML; moreover, most autograft recipients report normal or near normal activity levels, suggesting that this procedure need not to be associated either with prolonged convalescence or with chronic debility.","['Carella, A M', 'Lerma, E', 'Corsetti, M T', 'Dejana, A', 'Basta, P', 'Vassallo, F', 'Abate, M', 'Soracco, M', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Figari, O', 'Podesta, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Ferrara, R', 'Sessarego, M', 'Parodi, C', 'Pizzuti, M', 'Rubagotti, A', 'Occhini, D', 'Frassoni, F']","['Carella AM', 'Lerma E', 'Corsetti MT', 'Dejana A', 'Basta P', 'Vassallo F', 'Abate M', 'Soracco M', 'Benvenuto F', 'Figari O', 'Podesta M', 'Piaggio G', 'Ferrara R', 'Sessarego M', 'Parodi C', 'Pizzuti M', 'Rubagotti A', 'Occhini D', 'Frassoni F']","['Hematology/ABMT Unit, Department of Hematology, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy. amcarella@smartino.ge.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48716-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1534-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, ALL offers a useful opportunity to examine the glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P450 genes in determining susceptibility to pediatric cancers. Both enzymes are involved in carcinogen metabolism and have been shown to influence the risk a variety of solid tumors in adults. To determine whether these genes played a similar role in childhood leukemogenesis, we compared the allele frequencies of 177 childhood ALL patients and 304 controls for the CYP1A1, CYP2D6, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genes. We chose the French population of Quebec as our study population because of its relative genetic homogeneity. The GSTM1 null and CYP1A1*2A genotypes were both found to be significant predictors of ALL risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8). Those possessing both genotypes were at an even greater risk of developing the disease (OR = 3.3). None of the other alleles tested for proved to be significant indicators of ALL risk. Unexpectedly, girls carrying the CYP1A1*4 were significantly underrepresented in the ALL group (OR = 0.2), suggesting that a gender-specific protective role exists for this allele. These results suggest that the risk of ALL may indeed be associated with xenobiotics-metabolism, and thus with environmental exposures. Our findings may also explain, in part, why ALL is more prevalent among males than females.","['Krajinovic, M', 'Labuda, D', 'Richer, C', 'Karimi, S', 'Sinnett, D']","['Krajinovic M', 'Labuda D', 'Richer C', 'Karimi S', 'Sinnett D']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Cancerologie Charles-Bruneau et Centre de Recherche, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48711-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1496-501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) induces degradation of PML/RARalpha, differentiation of leukaemic blasts, and disease remission. However, RA resistance arises during RA treatment of APL patients. To investigate the phenomenon of RA resistance in APL, we generated RA-resistant sublines from APL-derived NB4 cells. The NB4.007/6 RA-resistant subline does not express the PML/RARalpha protein, although its mRNA is detectable at levels comparable to those of the parental cell line. In vitro degradation assays showed that the half-life of PML/RARalpha is less than 30 minutes in NB4.007/6 and longer than 3 hours in NB4. Treatment of NB4.007/6 cells with the proteasome inhibitors LLnL and lactacystin partially restored PML/RARalpha protein expression and resulted in a partial release of the RA-resistant phenotype. Similarly, forced expression of PML/RARalpha, but not RARalpha, into the NB4/007.6 cells restored sensitivity to RA treatment to levels comparable to those of the NB4 cells. These results indicate that constitutive degradation of PML/RARalpha protein may lead to RA resistance and that PML/RARalpha expression is crucial to convey RA sensitivity to APL cells.","['Fanelli, M', 'Minucci, S', 'Gelmetti, V', 'Nervi, C', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Fanelli M', 'Minucci S', 'Gelmetti V', 'Nervi C', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Pelicci PG']","['European Institute of Oncology, the Department of Experimental Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,1999/02/25 00:00,1999/02/25 00:01,['1999/02/25 00:00'],"['1999/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48708-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Mar 1;93(5):1477-81.,,,,,,['Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1478-9.

Recent work has suggested that the various isoforms of AC show differential sensitivity to ethanol, with Type VII AC being most sensitive. However, the mechanism of action of ethanol is unclear. In the present work, we investigated the effect of ethanol on AC activity in the human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line, platelets, and AC VII-transfected HEK 293 cells. The HEL cells contain abundant amounts of mRNA for Type VII AC. We found that both ethanol and phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) treatment enhanced agonist (prostaglandin E1; PGE1)-stimulated AC activity in HEL cells, as well as in platelets and HEK 293 cells transfected with AC VII. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) blocked the stimulatory effects of both ethanol and PDBu. However, the effects of ethanol and PDBu on AC activity were additive, suggesting that the mechanisms of action of ethanol and PDBu were not identical. Furthermore, a 30-min exposure of HEL cells to ethanol attenuated (desensitized) the ability of ethanol, but not PDBu, to enhance agonist-activated AC activity. On the other hand, a 30-min pretreatment with PDBu attenuated the AC response to the phorbol ester, but not to ethanol; but, after a 20 hr preincubation with phorbol ester, the ability of both PDBu and ethanol to enhance prostaglandin E1-stimulated AC activity was completely eliminated. Finally, pretreatment of HEL cells with pertussis toxin blocked the effect of PDBu, but not ethanol, on AC activity. The results support the involvement of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC(s) in ethanol's enhancement of agonist-activated activity of AC in HEL cells, but suggest that the mechanism of ethanol's action is different from that of PDBu. The findings with pertussis toxin suggest that PDBu activation of PKC(s) may affect AC activity through phosphorylation of a G1 protein, whereas ethanol may act by promoting phosphorylation of a different substrate (e.g., AC VII).","['Rabbani, M', 'Nelson, E J', 'Hoffman, P L', 'Tabakoff, B']","['Rabbani M', 'Nelson EJ', 'Hoffman PL', 'Tabakoff B']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Central Nervous System Depressants)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",IM,"['Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Central Nervous System Depressants/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1999/02/24 00:00,1999/02/24 00:01,['1999/02/24 00:00'],"['1999/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['00000374-199901000-00011 [pii]'],ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 1999 Jan;23(1):77-86.,['AA9014/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells grown on matrix showed no evidence of increased cellular alpha-actinin compared to cells grown on plastic substrata as measured by flow cytometry. In addition, there was no evidence of increased apoptosis as determined by DNA fragmentation assays or flow cytometry. However, 100 kD alpha-actinin was found in the extracellular matrix of bone marrow stroma by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. The alpha-actinin content in the stroma was markedly decreased after exposure to HL-60 cells. Furthermore, lysates of HL-60 cells or of peripheral blood monocytes can degrade exogenous alpha-actinin to produce a 31 kD fragment, which promotes monocyte/macrophage maturation.

In human AML, however, detection of MRD by PCR is limited to a minority of subgroups, as clonospecific markers are absent or presently unknown. Although gene labeling has proved to be efficient in detecting marker-devoid leukemia cells in preclinical models, detection and quantitation by PCR have not yet been considered. We therefore developed an experimental model in which detection and quantitation of genetically marked murine AML cells are based on a highly sensitive two-step nested PCR and competitive PCR protocol, respectively. We further demonstrated its applicability to a murine syngeneic BMT model that was designed to monitor minimal numbers of gene-tagged AML cells at various time intervals after transplantation.

Bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained before the commencement of the chemotherapy were cultured with various concentrations (0-10(-5) M) of Ara-C in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL of G-CSF, and the resultant cell proliferation/cytotoxicity was assayed. In all but one patient, half killing concentration (LC50) of Ara-C was significantly reduced in the presence of G-CSF (by 400- and 1.45-fold, median: 21-fold). Furthermore, LC(50) values in responders assayed in the presence of 10 ng/mL of G-CSF were significantly lower than those in nonresponders (p = 0.02). In vitro killing tests using a G-CSF-dependent leukemic cell line suggested that addition of G-CSF potentiates Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity through the mechanism of apoptosis.

Peak percentages of apoptosis in responders were significantly higher than those in nonresponders (p = 0.02).

We have demonstrated previously that bone marrow chimeras in which hematopoietic cells were replaced with cells expressing Fv-4 resistant (Fv-4r) gene product became refractory to Friend leukemia virus (FLV)-induced leukemogenesis. To induce in vivo resistance against retrovirus-induced diseases by retroviral vector-mediated gene transduction, we introduced Fv-4 env gene into bone marrow cells of FLV-susceptible C3H/He (C3H) mice with retroviral vector (pLSF) derived from murine Friend spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) and the cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated C3H mice. After the bone marrow transplantation, Fv-4r gene product was successfully expressed on erythroid and myeloid cells, while lymphoid cells were only weakly expressing Fv-4r gene product. The C3H mice expressing relatively higher amounts of Fv-4r gene product were rendered resistant to FLV-induced erythroleukemia, while mice expressing lower amounts of the Fv-4r gene product were still susceptible. Effective protection of FLV-induced leukemia in these mice suggested that the Fv-4r gene expression by erythroid cells that were the major target of FLV infection might be critical for resisting FLV-induced leukemia. Thus, gene therapy model by transducing Fv-4r env gene using bone marrow transplantation would provide a useful protection model system of retrovirus-induced diseases.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Aizawa, S', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Ikeda, H']","['Kitagawa M', 'Aizawa S', 'Kamisaku H', 'Hirokawa K', 'Ikeda H']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan. masapth2@med.tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*prevention & control', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*prevention & control']",,1999/02/24 00:00,1999/02/24 00:01,['1999/02/24 00:00'],"['1999/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X9800040X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00040-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Feb;27(2):234-41. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00040-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We infected 28 sheep with BLV and cloned exon 2 of the OLA-DRB1 gene from asymptomatic animals and from animals with lymphoma Sequence analysis revealed that, among 12 healthy sheep without any evidence of tumor, ten (83.3%) carried DRB1 alleles encoding Arg-Lys (RK) at positions beta70/71 as compared with only 6 (37.5%) of the 16 sheep with lymphoma, which suggested that alleles encoding the RK motif might protect against development of tumors after infection by BLV. By contrast, alleles encoding Ser-Arg (SR) at positions beta70/71 were present at a significantly elevated frequency in sheep with lymphoma as compared with the healthy carriers, which indicated that OLA-DRB1 alleles encoding the SR motif might be positively related to susceptibility to tumor development. The two amino acids in these motifs line a pocket that accommodates the side chain of a bound peptide according to a model of the crystal structure of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR1. To analyze immunoreactions of sheep with alleles that encoded RK or SR at beta70/71, we selected sheep with either the RK/SR genotypes or the SR/SR genotypes and immunized them with a mixture of multiple synthetic antigenic peptides that corresponded to T-helper, T-cytotoxic, and B-cell epitopes of the BLV envelope glycoprotein gp51. Two weeks after the last immunization, all of the sheep were challenged with BLV. Sheep with the RK/SR genotype produced neutralizing antibodies against BLV; they eliminated BLV completely within 28 weeks of the BLV challenge, and they gave strong lymphocyte-proliferative responses to the peptides used for immunization. Moreover, such animals did not develop lymphoma. By contrast, sheep with the SR/SR genotype continued to produce BLV throughout the experimental period and developed terminal disease. Our results indicate that the differences in immunoresponse were due to differences in major histocompatibility complex class II alleles and reflected the risk of BLV-induced leukemogenesis. In addition, it appears that susceptibility to tumor development may be determined to some extent by polymorphic residues binding to antigenic peptides directly within the binding cleft of the OLA-DR molecule.","['Nagaoka, Y', 'Kabeya, H', 'Onuma, M', 'Kasai, N', 'Okada, K', 'Aida, Y']","['Nagaoka Y', 'Kabeya H', 'Onuma M', 'Kasai N', 'Okada K', 'Aida Y']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sheep']",,1999/02/24 00:00,1999/02/24 00:01,['1999/02/24 00:00'],"['1999/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Feb 15;59(4):975-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a high concentration (>5 microM), As2O3 causes acute necrosis in various cell lines. At a lower concentration (0.5-5 microm), it induces myeloid cell maturation and an arrest in metaphase, leading to apoptosis. As2O3-treated cells have features found with both tubulin-assembling enhancers (Taxol) and inhibitors (colchicine). Prior treatment of monomeric tubulin with As2O3 markedly inhibits GTP-induced polymerization and microtubule formation in vitro but does not destabilize GTP-induced tubulin polymers. Cross-inhibition experiments indicate that As2O3 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GTP binding to tubulin. These observations correlate with the three-dimensional structure of beta-tubulin and suggest that the cross-linking of two vicinal cysteine residues (Cys-12 and Cys-213) by trivalent arsenic inactivates the GTP binding site. Furthermore, exogenous GTP can prevent As2O3-induced mitotic arrest.","['Li, Y M', 'Broome, J D']","['Li YM', 'Broome JD']","['Department of Laboratories, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.

To address this issue, we measured the proliferative response, variation of T cell subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, TCR-V delta 2 and TCR-V beta 8 T cells) and the cytokine profile (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) after MT stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a patient with concomitant CML and active pulmonary tuberculosis. The results were compared to four patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and no other coexistent diseases. The immunologic response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was also evaluated. In contrast to controls, the CML PBMC failed to proliferate in response to MT antigens. Mycobacterium-reactive CD4+, V delta 2 and V beta 8 T cells did not expand after MT stimulation of the CML PBMC. In MT antigens-stimulated cultures from the CML patient, IL-2 was not produced and mild reduction of IL-1 beta and INF-gamma were observed. In contrast, IL-10 was markedly elevated in these cultures. Similarly, PHA-stimulated PBMC from the CML patient showed no expansion of CD4+ and CD8+. T cells. In these cell cultures, INF-gamma concentration in supernatants was decreased and IL-10 was significantly elevated. This study suggests that patients with CML may present a profound immunosuppression of essential cellular and molecular immune effectors, a scenario which might contribute to the development of active tuberculosis.

Frequent refinements regarding lymphomas will be necessary, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, such as multiple myeloma and myelodysplasia, and conditions with changing definitions, such as malignant disease.

Well-designed and well-conducted clinical trials are the most appropriate setting for all bone marrow transplantations and patient referral to these trials remains the standard of care in all settings.","['Vaughan, W P', 'Silver, S M', 'Beatty, P G', 'Tallman, M S']","['Vaughan WP', 'Silver SM', 'Beatty PG', 'Tallman MS']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/02/24 00:00,1999/02/24 00:01,['1999/02/24 00:00'],"['1999/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 1998 Nov;12(11A):390-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Topotecan for myelodysplastic syndromes.,81-6,"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) list myelosuppressive chemotherapy as an option for patients who have MDS with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores of ""intermediate"" or ""high."" Myelodysplastic syndromes with these IPSS scores have an unfavorable natural history. Topotecan is a myelosuppressive drug that interacts with topoisomerase I and that has been used in the treatment of refractory AML. Its use in MDS has recently received considerable publicity. This paper reviews M. D. Anderson's results with topotecan and topotecan + ara-C in patients with MDS, focusing on comparisons of the results with ara-C and ara-C + fludarabine +/- idarubicin. While it is clear that the drug can produce complete responses, it is less clear that it differs from these other regimens. On average, complete response and survival rates are similar following administration of topotecan + ara-C or the other regimens. On the other hand, among patients with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, complete response rates are higher following topotecan + ara-C than for ara-C alone, or other ara-C combinations. The improvement in complete response rate among patients with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 has not resulted in an improvement in their survival (actuarial median about 6 months), largely reflecting a poor outcome following complete response. Indeed, the frequency of relapse in these patients suggests that any inherent increase in antileukemia activity in patients with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 is minimal. Given the overall results, topotecan +/- ara-C should not be regarded as standard therapy for MDS. The drug is nonetheless interesting and attempts to add to its efficacy are in progress.","['Estey, E H']",['Estey EH'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",14,1999/02/24 00:00,1999/02/24 00:01,['1999/02/24 00:00'],"['1999/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 1998 Nov;12(11A):81-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of irradiated or non-irradiated cells were examined. MFI rates (MFI value of irradiated cells/MFI value of non-irradiated cells) of each cell line were calculated at each investigated time point, and an augmentation of the Fas antigen expression with radiation was evaluated. FLAM-76 did not express Fas antigen at any time. An augmented expression of Fas antigen due to irradiation was observed in the other five cell lines. These findings strongly suggest that radiation can augment Fas antigen expression in certain tumor cells. Further studies using Fas ligand or specific anti-Fas antibody are needed.","['Nishioka, A', 'Ogawa, Y', 'Kubonishi, I', 'Kataoka, S', 'Hamada, N', 'Terashima, M', 'Inomata, T', 'Yoshida, S']","['Nishioka A', 'Ogawa Y', 'Kubonishi I', 'Kataoka S', 'Hamada N', 'Terashima M', 'Inomata T', 'Yoshida S']","['Department of Radiology, Kochi Medical School, Kohasu Okoh-cho Nankoku-city, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/*radiation effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,1999/02/24 03:01,2000/10/21 11:01,['1999/02/24 03:01'],"['1999/02/24 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijmm.3.3.275 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 1999 Mar;3(3):275-8. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.3.3.275.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD5(+) B cells are receptive to cytokines and interleukin-10 seems to be influential in the regulation of some of these CD5(+) B cells. The question of whether CD5 is a marker of activation or a molecule specific for a B cell lineage remains unresolved because evidence in support or against a separate lineage are still a matter for debate. However, we suggest the possibility of different kind of CD5(+) B cells. Indeed, activated CD5(+) B cells do proliferate, following CD5 engagement, while resting CD5(+) B cells do not. Moreover, three ligands for CD5 have, thus far, been identified but their functional effects are yet unknown. CD5(+) B cells probably play a role in setting up the idiotype network, antigen presentation and tolerance induction. B cells of most of the chronic lymphoid leukemias express CD5 molecules and, surprisingly, these cells may be expanded in non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or primary Sjogren's syndrome. CD5(+) B cells seems to be involved in the autoantibody production (this does not necessarily imply that pathogenic autoantibodies are produced by CD5(+) B cells) in autoimmune disease and particularly susceptible to transformation in lymphoproliferative disorders. Thus, this B cell population appears to play a key role at the crossroad of the non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases and B lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Pers, J O', 'Jamin, C', 'Predine-Hug, F', 'Lydyard, P', 'Youinou, P']","['Pers JO', 'Jamin C', 'Predine-Hug F', 'Lydyard P', 'Youinou P']","['Division of Dentistry, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,['0 (CD5 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology']",60,1999/02/24 03:01,2000/10/21 11:01,['1999/02/24 03:01'],"['1999/02/24 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '1999/02/24 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijmm.3.3.239 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 1999 Mar;3(3):239-45. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.3.3.239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous work has found that human AFP significantly stimulates the growth of mouse hepatoma cells in vitro. The purpose of the present study is to observe the effect of AFP on the proliferation of human hepatoma cells in vitro. Using a MTT- microculture tetrazolium assay, we found that the proliferation of human hepatoma cells was enhanced by in vitro treatment of AFP. However, the same concentrations of AFP had no effect on HL - 60 human leukemia cell proliferation, indicating that the human hepatoma cell proliferation - promoting role of AFP was not simply due to non-specific addition of exogenous protein and the proliferation enhancement of AFP showed certain tumor cell specificity. On the other hand, the growth stimulation of AFP could be diminished by rabbit anti - human AFP antibody. The anti- AFP antibody alone suppressed the growth of BEL - 7404 human hepatoma cells, not affecting HL - 60 cell proliferation. BEL - 7404 cell proliferation was not inhibited by normal rabbit immunoglobulins to demonstrate the specificity of anti-AFP effect. Taken together, it is concluded that AFP enhances the proliferation of human hepatoma cells in vitro, and this effect is seemingly mediated by an AFP/receptor autocrine pathway.","['Wang, X W', 'Xie, H']","['Wang XW', 'Xie H']","[""Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/immunology/*pharmacology/physiology']",,1999/02/23 00:00,1999/02/23 00:01,['1999/02/23 00:00'],"['1999/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320598005293 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(98)00529-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1999;64(1):17-23. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(98)00529-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from mice suggests an essential role for several paracrine mediators but species differences with implantation in the human preclude the extrapolation of these concepts to humans. An intrauterine microdialysis device (IUMD), consisting of microdialysis tubing glued into a balloon catheter on one side and into a polypropylene tube on the other, allows a dynamic and accurate in-vivo measurement of uterine paracrine interactions in humans. Inserted into the uterine cavity in the form of a loop, it can be continuously perfused with saline to reveal a number of relevant cytokines and growth factors in uterine effluents of non-pregnant women in both follicular and luteal phases. These included interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), prolactin, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). The source of intrauterine HCG is unclear since endometrial mRNA for the HCG beta-subunit is not revealed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Applying urinary HCG locally via the IUMD profoundly alters endometrial secretory parameters. Prolactin, IGFBP-1, and M-CSF are significantly inhibited and VEGF is regulated in a biphasic manner involving early stimulation followed by inhibition of intrauterine levels. Use of the IUMD has thus shown that the urinary HCG preparations routinely used for ovulation induction and luteal support may directly alter endometrial function.","['Licht, P', 'Losch, A', 'Dittrich, R', 'Neuwinger, J', 'Siebzehnrubl, E', 'Wildt, L']","['Licht P', 'Losch A', 'Dittrich R', 'Neuwinger J', 'Siebzehnrubl E', 'Wildt L']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/analysis/physiology', 'Endometrium/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/analysis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange/*physiology', 'Menstrual Cycle/physiology', 'Mice', 'Microdialysis', 'Pregnancy']",30,1999/02/23 00:00,1999/02/23 00:01,['1999/02/23 00:00'],"['1999/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humupd/4.5.532 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 1998 Sep-Oct;4(5):532-8. doi: 10.1093/humupd/4.5.532.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histologic features include acanthosis with uniform elongation of the rete ridges and xanthomatous cells that lie in and are typically confined to the papillary dermis. Although epidermal atypia is not a characteristic finding, we describe an unusual case of VX that has features of both VX and squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, there was a VX with typical histologic characteristics located at a separate site in the same patient. This case is also the first to our knowledge to be reported on the neck and axilla and is the third case associated with cutaneous graft versus host disease secondary to bone marrow transplant for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Mannes, K D', 'Dekle, C L', 'Requena, L', 'Sangueza, O P']","['Mannes KD', 'Dekle CL', 'Requena L', 'Sangueza OP']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'Xanthogranuloma, Juvenile/*complications/pathology']",,1999/02/23 00:00,1999/02/23 00:01,['1999/02/23 00:00'],"['1999/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000372-199902000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 1999 Feb;21(1):66-9. doi: 10.1097/00000372-199902000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main outcome measures were age specific and directly standardized incidence rates for all cancer sites (ICD9:140-208).

English south Asian rates were substantially higher than Indian subcontinent rates for a number of common sites including lung cancer in males, breast cancer in females and lymphoma in both sexes. English south Asian rates for childhood and early adult cancer (0-29 years) were similar or higher than non-south Asian rates. English south Asian rates were significantly higher than non-south Asian rates for Hodgkin's disease in males, cancer of the tongue, mouth, oesophagus, thyroid gland and myeloid leukaemia in females, and cancer of the hypopharynx, liver and gall bladder in both sexes. The results are consistent with a transition from the lower cancer risk of the country of ethnic origin to that of the country of residence.

It has been suggested that this is a consequence of the genomic instability associated with the syndrome. The elevated risk of malignancy is not, however, observed among A-T heterozygotes (except, apparently, regarding breast cancer). In this report we describe results from the study of the rare sporadic disease, T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). In all individuals tested, we observed that at least one ATM allele was disrupted by rearrangement, that in many cases both alleles were disrupted and that there were additional mutations, predominantly missense, that clustered toward the 3' end of the gene corresponding to the protein's phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK)-related domain. We conclude that the ATM gene can act as a tumour suppressor in the development of sporadic T-PLL. Our finding of a surfeit of mutations within ATM may reflect the involvement of the gene at more than one step in tumorigenesis. In particular, we suggest that the clustering of missense mutations may pertain to the late-onset character of both sporadic and A-T-related T-PLL, since the closest homologue of Atm protein is the yeast TEL1 protein that maintains telomere length. ATM inactivation may not be the initiating event in T-PLL tumorigenesis: prior mutation of another gene--perhaps TCL1 activation--may be obligate. This would explain the recessive character of T-PLL risk in A-T.","['Yuille, M A', 'Coignet, L J']","['Yuille MA', 'Coignet LJ']","['Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Haddow Laboratories, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

This review gives an overview on relevant polymorphisms of four families of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Rapid acetylators (with respect to N-acetyltransferase NAT2) were shown to have an increased risk of colon cancer, but a decreased risk of bladder cancer. In addition an association between a NAT1 variant allele (NAT*10, due to mutations in the polyadenylation site causing approximately two fold higher activity) and colorectal cancer among NAT2 rapid acetylators was observed, suggesting a possible interaction between NAT1 and NAT2. Glutathione S-transferases M1 and T1 (GSTM1 and GSTT1) are polymorphic due to large deletions in the structural gene. Meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies demonstrated a significant association between the homozygous deletion of GSTM1 (GSTM1-0) and lung cancer (odds ratio: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.23-1.61). Combination of GSTM1-0 with two allelic variants of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), CYP1A1 m2/m2 and CYP1A1 Val/Val further increases the risk for lung cancer. Indirect mechanisms by which deletion of GSTM1 increases risk for lung cancer may include GSTM1-0 associated decreased expression of GST M3 and increased activity of CYP1A1 and 1A2. Combination of GST M1-0 and NAT2 slow acetylation was associated with markedly increased risk for lung cancer (odds ratio: 7.8; 95% CI: 1.4-78.7). In addition GSTM1-0 is clearly associated with bladder cancer and possibly also with colorectal, hepatocellular, gastric, esophageal (interaction with CYP1A1), head and neck as well as cutaneous cancer. In individuals with the GSTT1-0 genotype more chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) were observed after exposure to 1,3-butadiene or various haloalkanes or haloalkenes. Evidence for an association between GSTT1-0 and myelodysplastic syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been presented. A polymorphic site of GSTP1 (valine to isoleucine at codon 104) decreases activity to several carcinogenic diol epoxides and was associated with testicular, bladder and lung cancer. Microsomal expoxide hydrolase (mEH) is polymorphic due to amino acid variation at residues 113 and 139. Polymorphic variants of mEH were associated with hepatocellular cancer (His-113 allele), ovarian cancer (Tyr-113 allele) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (His-113 allele). Three human sulfotransferases (STs) are regulated by genetic polymorphisms (hDHEAST, hM-PST, TS PST). Since a large number of environmental mutagens are activated by STs an association with human cancer risk might be expected.","['Hengstler, J G', 'Arand, M', 'Herrero, M E', 'Oesch, F']","['Hengstler JG', 'Arand M', 'Herrero ME', 'Oesch F']","['Institute of Toxicology, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

Patients present (median age, > 60 years) with evidence of bone marrow failure, anaemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and their sequelae, or AML is detected incidentally by a full blood count. Treatment for AML aims to eliminate leukaemia from bone marrow with intensive chemotherapy: age (over or under 60 years) and performance status determines whether standard or high-dose chemotherapy can be used, but fewer than half the patients with AML are under 60 years. Supportive therapy during initial induction chemotherapy is needed to control neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding, and to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapy. Standard induction chemotherapy produces complete remission in 56%-74% of patients; 20% are long term survivors; 10%-15% of patients die in the induction period. Allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended in patients under 50 years with an HLA- compatible sibling, with the best outcomes achieved in patients transplanted in first complete remission. It can also provide long term survival in patients who fail to achieve remission after induction therapy. The outcome of AML has improved, particularly for younger patients, but treatment outcomes for older patients and those with secondary leukaemia are still unsatisfactory. The mean overall survival of patients in randomised studies treated with standard therapy is still only 9-15 months.","['Bishop, J F']",['Bishop JF'],"['Sydney Cancer Centre, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, NSW. jbishop@canc.rpa.cs.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",36,1999/02/23 00:00,1999/02/23 00:01,['1999/02/23 00:00'],"['1999/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.5694/j.1326-5377.1999.tb126866.x [doi]'],ppublish,Med J Aust. 1999 Jan 4;170(1):39-43. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1999.tb126866.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report on the identification of regions of Fgf8 important for its transcriptional regulation in murine ES cell-derived embryoid bodies. Stable transfection of ES cells, using a human growth hormone reporter gene, was employed to identify regions of the Fgf8 gene with promoter/enhancer activity. A 2-kilobase 5' region of Fgf8 was shown to contain promoter activity. A 0.8-kilobase fragment derived from the large intron of Fgf8 was found to enhance human growth hormone expressed from the Fgf8 promoter 3-4-fold in an orientation dependent manner. The intronic fragment contains DNA-binding sites for the AP2, Pbx1, and Engrailed transcription factors.

Thus, 20 S proteasomes interact with the 3'-untranslated region of certain cytoplasmic mRNAs in vivo, and 20 S proteasomes isolated from Friend leukemia virus-infected mouse spleen cells were found to be associated with a mRNA fragment showing great homology to the 3'-untranslated region of tumor necrosis factor-beta mRNA that contains AUUUA sequences. We furthermore demonstrate that 20 S proteasomes destabilize oligoribonucleotides corresponding to the 3'-untranslated region of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, creating a specific cleavage pattern. The cleavage reaction is accelerated with increasing number of AUUUA motifs, and major cleavage sites are localized at the 5' side of the A residues. These results strongly suggest that 20 S proteasomes could be involved in the destabilization of cytokine mRNAs such as tumor necrosis factor mRNAs and other short-lived mRNAs containing AUUUA sequences.","['Jarrousse, A S', 'Petit, F', 'Kreutzer-Schmid, C', 'Gaedigk, R', 'Schmid, H P']","['Jarrousse AS', 'Petit F', 'Kreutzer-Schmid C', 'Gaedigk R', 'Schmid HP']","['Equipe ""Proteasome et Auto-Surveillance Cellulaire"" OVGV UA INRA 987, Universite Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand II, 24 avenue des Landais 63177, Aubiere cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.9.5925 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87740-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 26;274(9):5925-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.9.5925.,,,['GENBANK/AF109292'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells expressing transfected mouse gp49B1, mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine in either of the two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs of the gp49B1 cytoplasmic domain partially suppressed gp49B1-mediated inhibition of exocytosis, whereas mutation of both abolished inhibitory capacity. Sodium pervanadate elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of native gp49B1 and association of the tyrosine phosphatases src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and SHP-2 in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMCs). SHP-1 associated transiently with gp49B1 within 1 min after coligation of gp49B1 with cross-linked FcepsilonRI in mBMMCs. SHP-1-deficient mBMMCs exhibited a partial loss of gp49B1-mediated inhibition of FcepsilonRI-induced exocytosis at concentrations of IgE providing optimal exocytosis, revealing a central, but not exclusive, SHP-1 requirement in the counter-regulatory pathway. Coligation of gp49B1 with cross-linked FcepsilonRI on mBMMCs inhibited early release of calcium from intracellular stores and subsequent influx of extracellular calcium, consistent with SHP-1 participation. Because exocytosis is complete within 2 min in mBMMCs, our studies establish a role for SHP-1 in the initial counter-regulatory cellular responses whereby gp49B1 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs rapidly transmit inhibition of FcepsilonRI-mediated exocytosis.","['Lu-Kuo, J M', 'Joyal, D M', 'Austen, K F', 'Katz, H R']","['Lu-Kuo JM', 'Joyal DM', 'Austen KF', 'Katz HR']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Gp49a protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lilrb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Exocytosis', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tyrosine/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'src Homology Domains']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.9.5791 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87724-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 26;274(9):5791-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.9.5791.,"['AI-31599/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-41144/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight AML patient cell lines and 25 primary AML blast cell samples were investigated. The cell lines secreted high quantities of sIL-6R into their culture medium when examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To determine whether sIL-6R is synthesized by a mechanism of alternative splicing, RNA was analysed from all the AML blast cell samples by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In this method, primer sites flanking the transmembrane domain were utilized and the alternatively spliced IL-6R mRNA was distinguished from the non-spliced transcript form by size. All the cell lines and 64% of the primary blast cell samples expressed the alternatively spliced IL-6R mRNA. To confirm the phenomenon of alternative splicing at protein level, cytoplasmic protein fractions of the cell lines were investigated by using a sensitive adaptation of the Western blot method. All the cell lines expressed two IL-6R proteins sized 80 and 50 kDa and corresponding to the membraneous and soluble forms of IL-6R, respectively. In conclusion, the results obtained at both mRNA and protein levels strongly support alternative splicing as a mechanism of sIL-6R production in AML. Because sIL-6R modulates the effects of IL-6 on target cells, differences in sIL-6R expression levels may partially explain the previously observed diversity in IL-6-induced growth responses in AML","['Saily, M', 'Koistinen, P', 'Pulkki, K', 'Zheng, A', 'Savolainen, E R']","['Saily M', 'Koistinen P', 'Pulkki K', 'Zheng A', 'Savolainen ER']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(98)90003-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1043-4666(98)90003-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Nov;10(11):860-7. doi: 10.1016/s1043-4666(98)90003-5.,,,,,,['Cytokine. 2000 Apr;12(4):422.

This suggests that resistance to apoptosis may play a critical role both in the pathogenesis and resistance to treatment of MM. Bcl-2 is a key protein for the regulation of apoptosis. However, it has been shown that this protein also regulates the state of proliferation. In the current study, we show that malignant plasma cells from both the bone marrow and peripheral blood express high levels of Bcl-2 and are slowly proliferating cells. In contrast, myeloma cells from extramedullary sites (ie pleural effusion, ascitis, mammary and gastric plasmacytoma) express Bcl-2 weakly while being highly proliferative. Normal non-dividing bone marrow plasma cells express high levels of Bcl-2 protein. In contrast, four highly proliferative reactive plasmacytosis express weak levels of Bcl-2. We conclude that there is an inverse correlation between Bcl-2 expression and the proliferation rate of both normal and malignant plasma cells.

Seventy-one patients (refractory: 15; relapse 'on therapy': 36; and relapse 'off therapy': 20) received two courses of VIM3ARAC (teniposide, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, mitoguazone, high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytarabine, prednisolone). SCT was performed only in patients with minimal disease after the second course. The response rate was 72%. It was not influenced by response to first-line therapy. Forty-eight patients (68%), including 32 complete responders, fulfilled response criteria for SCT. Thirty-six patients underwent SCT (allogeneic: 3; autologous: 33). The 4-year DFS rate of the 48 responding patients was 39%. The actuarial survival at 4 years was 34% for all patients. Relapse off therapy and a performance status <2 at relapse were the only two independent favorable prognostic factors for survival. In conclusion, VIM3AraC is associated with a high response rate in relapsing and refractory aggressive NHL. Up to half of the patients could receive SCT.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) responded to the combination treatment of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3] plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and differentiated into monocyte/macrophage-like cells, as well as expressed strong alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. Since PMA has limited clinical application due to its tumor-promoting effect, another protein kinase C activator, bryostatin-1, was currently tested for its interaction with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 to induce NB4 cell differentiation and block cell proliferation. Bryostatin-1 alone, but not 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 alone, significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced NB4 cell differentiation into monocyte/macrophages; however neither bryostatin-1 nor 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 alone induced ALP expression. Like PMA, bryostatin-1 synergistically interacted with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 to stimulate ALP expression 30-fold over the control (P < 0.001) and further promote appearance of monocyte/macrophage-like cells. The ALP stimulation was both time- and dose-dependent. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that the combination of bryostatin-1 and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 strongly affect NB4 cell differentiation and proliferation. Therefore, this proposed combination treatment may be an alternatively potential therapeutic regimen for APL patients and assay of ALP may be a more sensitive and facile way to monitor the possible remission of APL patients.","['Song, X D', 'Norman, A W']","['Song XD', 'Norman AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of California-Riverside, 92521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Lactones/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401261 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):275-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401261.,['DK-09012-033/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the role of alpha4beta1 integrin/fibronectin interaction in preventing apoptosis of these cells in vitro. B cells from 16 patients showed constant expression of alpha4beta1 and little or no alpha5beta1. B-CLL cells cultured on fibronectin or two previously described fibronectin recombinant fragments (H89 and H0) which contain the ligands for alpha4beta1, consistently showed higher viability than control cells cultured on poly-lysine. The H89 fragment, containing the high affinity ligand CS-1, was the most efficient substrate with mean cell viability values of 72, 60 and 35% at days 2, 5 and 8 of culture, respectively. For control cells these values were 40, 27 and 15%, respectively. Parallel cell cycle analysis confirmed these results. The anti-apoptotic effect required direct contact with immobilized substrata since it was not observed when using B-CLL conditioned media alone or when clustering alpha4beta1 with specific mAbs in suspension. Quantitation of the apoptosis regulatory proteins Bcl-2 and Bax revealed that cells cultured on the H89 fragment showed high/moderate levels of Bcl-2 (with some interpatient variation) and low levels of Bax resulting in an elevated Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results indicate that adhesion of B-CLL cells to fibronectin upregulate the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and this may contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect induced via alpha4beta1 integrin.","['de la Fuente, M T', 'Casanova, B', 'Garcia-Gila, M', 'Silva, A', 'Garcia-Pardo, A']","['de la Fuente MT', 'Casanova B', 'Garcia-Gila M', 'Silva A', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Departamento de Immunologia, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401275 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):266-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401275.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the purpose of further quantifying the potential contributions of Pgp-mediated drug efflux and Mvp/LRP to drug resistance in AML we have investigated whether the transport function of Pgp and the expression of Mvp/LRP correlated with the accumulation of daunorubicin (DNR) and the in vitro resistance to DNR cytotoxicity (LC50 by MTT assay) in AML cells. In de novo adult AML, the steady-state DNR accumulation (in pmol/10(6) cells) correlated with Pgp activity or expression, whereas the LC50 for DNR did not correlate with Pgp activity (measured as the modulation of rhodamine 123 or DNR accumulation by the Pgp inhibitor PSC833) or Pgp expression (measured by flow cytometry with the MRK-16 antibody). The contribution of MRP1 expression to a reduced DNR accumulation seems minor compared to Pgp. In addition, the modulation of the DNR LC50 by PSC833 did not correlate with Pgp protein or activity. The steady-state DNR accumulation showed no correlation with the DNR LC50. The Mvp/LRP expression (immunocytochemical staining) did neither correlate with DNR accumulation nor with the DNR LC50. A significant negative correlation was seen between the Mvp/LRP immunocytochemical staining and Pgp activity, indicating that both markers define (partially) different populations. In conclusion, it is shown that Pgp function, but not Mvp/LRP or MRP1 expression correlate with a low steady-state DNR accumulation in de novo AML. The Pgp activity does, however, not predict the DNR sensitivity in AML measured as in vitro DNR LC50 with an MTT-based assay. The reason for that seems to be that a low DNR accumulation may not be the most important factor in determining the LC50. While the clinical usefulness of these drug resistance tests remains to be proven they do not seem to provide as yet a straightforward explanation for the major cause(s) of clinical chemotherapy failure.","['Broxterman, H J', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Pieters, R', 'Lankelma, J', 'Eekman, C A', 'Loonen, A H', 'Schoester, M', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Broxterman HJ', 'Sonneveld P', 'Pieters R', 'Lankelma J', 'Eekman CA', 'Loonen AH', 'Schoester M', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Pinedo HM', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*biosynthesis']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401331 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):258-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401331.,,,,,,['Leukemia. 1999 Sep;13(9):1468-9.

A report on 25 cases.,250-7,"Two main types of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias (tAML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (tMDS) have been described. The first classical type typically occurs late after use of alkylating agents and presents as MDS with -7/del 7q and/or -5/del5q. The second form occurs early after the use of agents targeted at topoisomerase II, and presents as AML with 11q23 or other rearrangements of de novo AML. Recently, we and others reported, in AML and MDS, a strong correlation between cytogenetic rearrangements leading to 17p deletion, a specific type of dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutation; several of those cases of 17p- syndrome were therapy-related. Over the last 15 years, we observed 25 cases of tAML and tMDS with 17p deletion, which represented 36% of the AML and MDS with 17p deletion diagnosed during that period. Median age was 59 years. Twenty-one patients had tMDS and four tAML. Typical dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutation and/or overexpression were seen in 22 of 24 and 16 of 19 evaluable patients, respectively. 17p deletion resulted from unbalanced translocations involving 17p (18 cases), monosomy 17 (five cases), i(17q) (one case) or del 17p (one case). Twenty-one patients also had -5/del 5q, and/or -7/del 7q. Median interval from treatment of the first tumor of tAML and tMDS was 94 months (range 19-252). Median survival was only 7 months. Based on primary tumor and antineoplastic agents used, patients could be relatively well divided into two groups: a first group of 11 cases, occurring mainly after a lymphoid neoplasm (eight cases) treated by chemotherapy with an alkylating agent (10 cases), and a second group of 14 cases occurring after essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV) treated mainly by hydroxyurea (10 cases), pipobroman (eight cases), 32P (six cases) but rarely by alkylating agents (two cases). -7/del 7q was found in 10 of the 11 patients in the first group, as compared to three of the 14 patients of the second group (P = 0.0001). Therefore, therapy-related cases represent a high proportion of AML and MDS with the 17p- syndrome. They have many features in common with classical tMDS and tAML, including long interval from the first tumor, a usual preleukemic phase, and frequent occurrence of -5/del 5q. About one half of them, in addition, occur after alkylating agents and generally carry -7/del 7q. The other half, however, occur mainly after ET or PV treated by hydroxyurea or other non-alkylating agents, and usually have no -7/del 7q. These findings bring further support to a possible relationship between prior drugs used and cytogenetic rearrangements in tAML and tMDS.","['Merlat, A', 'Lai, J L', 'Sterkers, Y', 'Demory, J L', 'Bauters, F', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Fenaux, P']","['Merlat A', 'Lai JL', 'Sterkers Y', 'Demory JL', 'Bauters F', 'Preudhomme C', 'Fenaux P']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/genetics']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401298 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):250-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401298.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of therapy may be improved by combining ITs with IT-cytotoxicity enhancing agents. We studied the effect of various agents that influence the intracellular routing of ITs on the activity of the anti-B cell IT CD22-recombinant (rec) ricin A. In protein synthesis inhibition assays the carboxylic ionophores monensin and nigericin enhanced the activity of the IT 117- and 382-fold, respectively, against the cell line Daudi, and 81- and 318-fold, respectively, against the cell line Ramos. IT activity to Daudi and Ramos was enhanced to a lesser extent by the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine (14- and 11-fold, respectively) and NH4Cl (nine- and 10-fold, respectively). However, the combination of NH4Cl and chloroquine induced more than an additive effect (145- and 107-fold, respectively). Cytotoxicity was not influenced by brefeldin A, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), verapamil and perhexiline maleate. Bacitracin enhanced the IT cytotoxicity in contrast to the other protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, albeit enhancement was weak (two-fold). The enhancers exerted only a negligible effect on bone marrow progenitor cells. We recently developed a flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay in which cell elimination can be assessed. In order to detect enhancement in this assay, we used 5 x 10(-11) M IT (approximately the 50% protein synthesis inhibiting dose (ID50)). This concentration killed 41% of the Daudi cells and 42% of the Ramos cells. In the presence of 10 nM monensin the IT killed 74% and 99% and in the presence of 10 nM nigericin 96% and 99% of the Daudi and Ramos cells, respectively. At 10(-8) M, CD22-rec ricin A eliminated malignant cells originating from three patients with B-CLL (0.42 log) and two with B-ALL (0.19 log) patients. Cytotoxicity to malignant cells was enhanced by NH4Cl, chloroquine, monensin and nigericin. The combination of NH4Cl and chloroquine enhanced the activity most effectively (up to 2.06 log). To determine the applicability of the IT in combination with enhancers in vivo we investigated the effect of human serum. Human serum inhibited IT activity which could not be restored by monensin and nigericin because of complete inhibition of these enhancers by serum. In contrast, chloroquine partially restored the activity of CD22-rec ricin A in the presence of human serum. We conclude that monensin, nigericin and the combination of NH4Cl and chloroquine can be used instead of NH4Cl to potentiate CD22-rec ricin A activity in purging autologous bone marrow transplants contaminated with malignant B cells. Chloroquine might be a promising enhancer of CD22-rec ricin A for treating patients in vivo.","['van Horssen, P J', 'van Oosterhout, Y V', 'Evers, S', 'Backus, H H', 'van Oijen, M G', 'Bongaerts, R', 'de Witte, T', 'Preijers, F W']","['van Horssen PJ', 'van Oosterhout YV', 'Evers S', 'Backus HH', 'van Oijen MG', 'Bongaerts R', 'de Witte T', 'Preijers FW']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', '*Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Recombinant Proteins/toxicity', 'Ricin/*toxicity', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401262 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):241-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401262.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic CD3+ CD8hi+ CD57+ LGL showed several phenotypic differences such as an upregulation of CD16 and adhesion molecules (mainly CD11c, CD58 and CD54), activation markers and an exclusive CD45RA isoform expression. Unstimulated CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ LGL from both leukemic and BMT donors spontaneously developed an ex vivo CTL-like CD3-redirected cytotoxicity but no NK cell activity. Different stimuli (PHA, PMA or rhIL-2) induced similar cytotoxic profiles after a 6-day culture involving a CD3-redirected lysis predominating over a low NK cell activity. However, culture of leukemic LGL with these stimuli allowed either a 2 week persistence (PMA or rhIL-2) of CD8+ CD57+ LGL or their disappearance after 3 days (PHA). Furthermore, leukemic CD8hi+ CD57+ T lymphocytes produced an inhibitor of cytotoxic functions as previously described for BMT recipients' CD8+ CD57+ cells. Thus, despite some phenotypic differences between both cell sources, leukemic CD57+ T-LGL display the same functional characteristics of cytotoxic effector and immunoregulatory T cells as CD8+ CD57+ T cells from BMT recipients which might represent their normal counterpart.","['Mollet, L', 'Fautrel, B', 'Leblond, V', 'Bergeron, F', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Baumelou, E', 'Hubert, P', 'Debre, P', 'Autran, B']","['Mollet L', 'Fautrel B', 'Leblond V', 'Bergeron F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Baumelou E', 'Hubert P', 'Debre P', 'Autran B']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Tissulaire, CNRS-UMR 7627, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/*blood', 'CD57 Antigens/*blood', 'CD8 Antigens/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401266 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):230-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to analyze possible phenotypic changes induced by HTLV-I after infection of human lymphocytes, CD4+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood of three healthy donors, by separation through immunomagnetic beads. CD4+ lymphocytes were then infected by coculture with irradiated HTLV-I producing MT-2 cells. The phenotypic profile of infected cells was studied by flow cytometric analysis using monoclonal antibodies against lymphoid (CD3, CD4, TCR alpha/beta) and myelomonocitic markers (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34). The results show that HTLV-I immortalized cell lines coexpressed CD13, CD33 and lymphoid markers. No expression of CD14, CD15 and CD34 was observed.

In 15 cases membrane expression of TCRgammadelta proteins could be studied extensively by flow cytometry with a new Vgamma/Vdelta antibody panel. Virtually all TCRgammadelta+ T-ALLs expressed TdT, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD6, and CD7, but they were heterogeneous in their CD1/CD4/CD8 immunophenotype. The majority expressed either CD4+/CD8- or CD4+/CD8+, whereas only 7/30 TCRgammadelta+ T-ALLs lacked both antigens. Despite heterogeneity in the rearranged TCRG and TCRD genes, we found preferential protein expression of VgammaI (21/30), Jgamma2.3 (19/30) and Cgamma2 (21/30) gene products in the TCRgammadelta+ T-ALL. Expressed TCRD genes were largely limited to Vdelta1-Jdelta1, except for six patients who expressed non-Vdelta1 TCRdelta chains (Vdelta2-Jdelta1, Vdelta2-Jdelta3, Vdelta3-Jdelta1, Vdelta6-Jdelta2, and two Valpha-Jdelta1). In spite of the relatively limited combinatorial repertoire of the TCRG and TCRD genes, the junctional region diversity of the expressed genes was extensive. The Vgamma/Vdelta antibody panel confirmed the predominant, but not exclusive, expression of VgammaI and Vdelta1 proteins. Importantly, not a single T-ALL expressed the common peripheral blood Vgamma9+/Vdelta2+ phenotype. These immunogenotypic and immunophenotypic characteristics represent excellent targets for flow cytometric and PCR-based detection of 'minimal residual disease' in all TCRgammadelta+ T-ALL. Comparison of non-Vdelta1+ TCRgammadelta T-ALLs with the more common Vdelta1+ type showed a trend towards a more mature immunogenotype in the former. Firstly, more complete TCRD rearrangements were identified on the non-expressed allele in the non-Vdelta1+ group (83% vs 43%); secondly, a higher frequency of 'end-stage' Jgamma2.3 gene rearrangements was found in non-Vdelta1 cases on both TCRG alleles (83% vs 66%); thirdly, a higher frequency of complete TCRB rearrangements was found in non-Vdelta1 cases (79% vs 50%).","['Langerak, A W', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van den Beemd, M W', 'van Wering, E R', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Hahlen, K', 'Necker, A', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Langerak AW', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van den Beemd MW', 'van Wering ER', 'Ludwig WD', 'Hahlen K', 'Necker A', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', '*Immunogenetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/immunology/*physiology']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401276 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):206-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401276.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 93% (187/201) of the precursor-B-ALL patients one or more genes were rearranged and/or deleted. TCRB gene rearrangements were found in 35% (69/196), TCRG gene rearrangements in 59% (113/192), TCRD gene rearrangements in 55% (112/202), and isolated monoallelic or biallelic deletions of TCRD loci in 34% (68/202) of the cases. TCRB gene rearrangements involved exclusively the Jbeta2 locus with complete V(D)Jbeta2 joinings in 53% of gene rearrangements and incomplete Dbeta-Jbeta2 gene rearrangements in 33%. TCRG gene rearrangements frequently occurred on both alleles (65% of cases) and in approximately 70% concerned rearrangements to Jgamma1 gene segments. Most rearranged TCRD alleles (80%) represented incomplete Vdelta2-Ddelta3 or Ddelta2-Ddelta3 gene rearrangements, while the remaining TCRD gene rearrangements remained unidentified. Subsequently, we evaluated, whether heteroduplex PCR analysis of rearranged TCRG and TCRD genes can be used for reliable identification of PCR targets for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). The concordance between SB and heteroduplex PCR analysis for detection of the various types of clonal TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements ranged between 78% and 87%. The discrepancies could be assigned to the presence of 'atypical' TCRD gene rearrangements or translocations only detectable by SB, but also to efficient PCR-based detection of rearrangements derived from small subclones, which are difficult to detect with SB. Indications for oligoclonality were observed in 38% and 30% of patients with TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements, respectively, which is comparable to the frequency of oligoclonality in IGH locus. Based on the combined data it was possible to reduce the broad panel of six TCRD and 12 TCRG primer combinations for MRD studies to two TCRD combinations (Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3) and six TCRG combinations (VgammaI, VgammaII, VgammaIV family-specific primers with Jgamma1.1/2.1 and Jgamma1.3/2.3 primers) resulting in the detection of 80% and 97% of all TCRD and TCRG gene rearrangements, respectively. Finally, the heteroduplex PCR data indicate that MRD monitoring with TCRG and/or TCRD targets is possible in approximately 80% of childhood precursor-B-ALL patients; approximately 55% of patients even have two TCRG and/or TCRD targets.","['Szczepanski, T', 'Beishuizen, A', 'Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Wijkhuijs, A J', 'Tibbe, G J', 'De Bruijn, M A', 'Van Dongen, J J']","['Szczepanski T', 'Beishuizen A', 'Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Van Wering ER', 'Wijkhuijs AJ', 'Tibbe GJ', 'De Bruijn MA', 'Van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Eramus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401277 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):196-205. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401277.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assessment of clonality has proved to be useful in determining whether even those very late events represent the reoccurrence of the original clone or alternatively a secondary leukemia. To gain further information on clonal stability in such late relapse, we performed detailed comparative Southern blotting and PCR analyses of TcRdelta and TcRgamma gene rearrangements in five ALL at presentation and subsequent relapse which occurred more than 5 years after diagnosis. At least one stable rearranged allele of the TcRdelta and TcRgamma loci was traced in all cases at presentation and clinical relapse despite a wide heterogeneity of the pattern of rearrangements. Our study extends to a larger series of patients previous findings which have sought to analyze the phenomenon of clonal evolution in children relapsed after more than 5 years of CCR. With respect to the potential pitfalls in monitoring minimal residual disease in childhood ALL for the presence of clonal evolution, our results highlight the combination of two target genes (such as TcRgamma and TcRdelta) as a tool to reduce false negative MRD results.","['Lo Nigro, L', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Di Cataldo, A', 'Pannunzio, A', ""D'Aniello, E"", 'Masera, G', 'Schiliro, G', 'Biondi, A']","['Lo Nigro L', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Pannunzio A', ""D'Aniello E"", 'Masera G', 'Schiliro G', 'Biondi A']","['Divisione di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica, Universita di Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Recurrence']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401269 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):190-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401269.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore analyzed the clinical and biological implications of this feature by studying p16ink4a expression in 58 cases of childhood ALL. mRNA and protein were significantly correlated and both appeared more highly expressed in B than in T lineage ALLs: 13 out of the 15 T cell ALLs did not show any p16ink4a expression. The main result of this study is the strong prognostic value of p16ink4a expression. When stratifying the patients in three groups according to p16ink4a expression, we observed in univariate analysis: (1) the shortest disease-free survival for patients presenting a high p16ink4a level; (2) contrasting with the good prognosis in the group of patients expressing p16ink4a at low level; (3) while cases without any expression of the inhibitor were associated with a medium course of the disease (P=0.0165). This prognostic value was confirmed by the multivariate analysis showing therapeutic regimen and p16ink4a protein expression as the only variables retained in the model. A specific metabolic profile related to cellular survival and proliferation was observed in each of the three p16ink4a expression groups. Among the cell cycle-related proteins we analyzed, only p21waf1 bcl-2 and CDK4 were significantly and positively correlated to p16ink4a. Furthermore, CDK6 was also strongly expressed in the group of cases with high p16ink4a level. An enhancement of p16ink4a, p21waf1 and bcl-2 was previously described in prolonged cellular survival, while aging cells showed a decrease in CDK4 expression. The concomitant high expression of the oncogenic protein CDK4 (and of CDK6), we observed, may amplify the leukemic advantage of prolonged lifespan blast cells by favoring cell progression through G1 phase. These data suggest that at least two mechanisms may be associated in the oncogenesis of very aggressive ALLs, ie deregulation of cell multiplication and prolonged blast lifespan.","['Mekki, Y', 'Catallo, R', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Manel, A M', 'Ffrench, P', 'Baghdassarian, N', 'Duhaut, P', 'Bryon, P A', 'Ffrench, M']","['Mekki Y', 'Catallo R', 'Bertrand Y', 'Manel AM', 'Ffrench P', 'Baghdassarian N', 'Duhaut P', 'Bryon PA', 'Ffrench M']","['Laboratoire de Cytologie Analytique, Universite Claude Bernard, MESRT JE 1879, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', '*Genes, p16', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401303 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):181-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical staining for MPO activity is used clinically to distinguish myeloid from acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL). However, using a highly sensitive RT-PCR technique, it is possible to detect MPO mRNA in otherwise clear ALL. The significance of this finding remains poorly understood. We have extended our observations to a series of 57 patients with the primary diagnosis of ALL (46 patients tested at diagnosis and 11 cases at relapse). We identified 25 cases (43.8%) of MPO mRNA(+)/enzyme(-) ALL (17 B cell and eight T cell lineage). Expression of myeloid antigens (CD13 or CD33) were detected in nine of them, and remarkably, 18 cases (72%) displayed CD34. Of these 25 MPO mRNA(+) leukemias, 10 (40%) are Bcr-Abl positive (with P210 fusion transcript in five patients while the five remaining cases carried P190 transcript). Moreover, 11 of 16 myeloid negative cases were also negative for any type of Bcr-Abl and MLL rearrangement, indicating that MPO mRNA positivity is not either invariably related to that chromosomal abnormality or necessarily associated with the presence of other myeloid differentiation features. Interestingly, six of these 11 cases are T-ALL, suggesting the presence of some overlapping phase for T and myeloid lineage commitment. Taken together, these findings could suggest a separate biological disease with immature origin and bipotential differentiation capability, which involves B and T-ALL subtypes and should lead to new investigations regarding their prognostic impact.","['Serrano, J', 'Roman, J', 'Jimenez, A', 'Castillejo, J A', 'Navarro, J A', 'Sanchez, J', 'Garcia-Castellanos, J M', 'Martin, C', 'Maldonado, J', 'Torres, A']","['Serrano J', 'Roman J', 'Jimenez A', 'Castillejo JA', 'Navarro JA', 'Sanchez J', 'Garcia-Castellanos JM', 'Martin C', 'Maldonado J', 'Torres A']","['University Hospital Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401305 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):175-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401305.,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1671-2.

In this study, we investigated the ability of normal donor DC pulsed ex vivo with 12 mer bcr-abl (b3a2) peptide to generate b3a2-specific autologous or HLA-identical sibling donor's cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). DC that were grown from normal peripheral blood adherent cells or purified DC precursors in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4, were pulsed with b3a2-peptide then were induced to become mature and functional cells by the addition of TNF-alpha. These peptide-pulsed mature DC elicited a potent b3a2-specific CTL response in vitro. The b3a2-peptide pulsed DC-primed peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) displayed significantly higher cytotoxic activity compared with peptide non-pulsed DC-primed PBL against target cells, which are b3a2 positive marrow cells derived from HLA-identical sibling chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient, or peptide-pulsed autologous macrophages (P < 0.001). In addition, the b3a2 peptide-pulsed DC-primed and non-pulsed DC-primed PBL showed no cytotoxic response against peptide non-pulsed autologous macrophages. These findings revealed that normal donor PBL pre-immunized with b3a2-peptide pulsed autologous DC could increase the graft-versus-leukemia effect without exaggerating graft-versus-host-disease. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes were shown to be involved in the effector cell populations. The b3a2 peptide-pulsed DC-primed T cells were significantly superior in their production of GM-CSF and TNF-alpha compared with peptide non-pulsed DC-primed T cells. These intriguing preclinical results imply the feasibility of developing b3a2 peptide-DC based protocol for in vitro sensitization of normal donor leukocytes before donor leukocyte transfusions for patients with CML, who relapsed after HLA-matched sibling bone marrow transplantation.","['Osman, Y', 'Takahashi, M', 'Zheng, Z', 'Koike, T', 'Toba, K', 'Liu, A', 'Furukawa, T', 'Aoki, S', 'Aizawa, Y']","['Osman Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Zheng Z', 'Koike T', 'Toba K', 'Liu A', 'Furukawa T', 'Aoki S', 'Aizawa Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Niigata University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blood Donors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'HLA Antigens/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*chemistry']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401311 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Feb;13(2):166-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401311.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, plasma drug levels progressively decrease following prolonged treatment with oral ATRA. This decrease is due, at least in part, to the induced cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolism of ATRA. To investigate if incorporation of ATRA in liposomes could alter its metabolism, we compared the cellular metabolism of liposomal-ATRA (L-ATRA) with free drug. Microsomes isolated from the rat liver metabolized L-ATRA to a significantly lower extent than they did free-ATRA. Similarly, in F9 cells, L-ATRA was metabolized at a slower rate than the free drug. These results suggest that L-ATRA may have important clinical implications in terms of slowing down the rate of ATRA metabolism and producing long-term remission in APL patients.","['Parthasarathy, R', 'Mehta, K']","['Parthasarathy R', 'Mehta K']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'K0Q29TGV9Y (liarozole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', '*Drug Carriers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', '*Liposomes', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/*enzymology', 'Rats', 'Teratocarcinoma/*enzymology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(98)00226-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00226-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Dec 25;134(2):121-8. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00226-2.,['FDR000923/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because 90Y is a beta emitter, quantitative information from imaging is suboptimal. With the concept of a ""matched pair"" of isotopes, 111In is used as a surrogate markerfor90Y. We evaluated the differences in biodistribution between 111In- and 90Y-labeled murine antiTac MoAb directed against the IL-2Ralpha receptor. METHODS: The antiTac was conjugated to the 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (1B4M-DTPA, also known as MX-DTPA). Nine patients with adult T-cell leukemia were treated. Patients received approximately 185 MBq (5 mCi) 111In-labeled antiTac for imaging and 185-555 MBq (5-15 mCi) 90Y-labeled antiTac for therapy. The immunoreactivity of 111In-labeled antiTac was 90%+/-6%, whereas for 90Y-labeled antiTac, it was 74%+/-12%. RESULTS: The differences in blood and plasma kinetics of the two isotopes were small. The area undemeath the blood radioactivity curve was 1.91 percentage+/-0.58 percentage injected dose (%ID) x h/mL for 111In and 1.86%+/-0.64 %ID x h/mL for 90Y. Urinary excretion of 90Y was significantly greater than that of 111In in the first 24 h (P = 0.001), but later, the excretion of 111In was significantly greater (P = 0.001 to P = 0.04). Core biopsies of bone marrow showed a mean of 0.0029+/-0.0012 %ID/g for 111In, whereas the 90Y concentration was 0.0049+/-0.0021 %ID/g. Analyses of activity bound to circulating cells showed concentrations of 500-30,000 molecules of antiTac per cell. When cell-bound activity was corrected for immunoreactive fraction, the ratio of 111In to 90Y in circulating cells was 1.11+/-0.17. Three biopsies of tumor-involved skin showed ratios of 111In to 90Y of 0.7, 0.9 and 1.1. CONCLUSION: This study shows that differences typically ranging from 10% to 15% exist in the biodistribution between 111In- and 90Y-labeled antiTac. Thus, it appears that 111In can be used as a surrogate marker for 90Y when labeling antiTac with the 1 B4M chelate, although underestimates of the bone marrow radiation dose should be anticipated.","['Carrasquillo, J A', 'White, J D', 'Paik, C H', 'Raubitschek, A', 'Le, N', 'Rotman, M', 'Brechbiel, M W', 'Gansow, O A', 'Top, L E', 'Perentesis, P', 'Reynolds, J C', 'Nelson, D L', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Carrasquillo JA', 'White JD', 'Paik CH', 'Raubitschek A', 'Le N', 'Rotman M', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Gansow OA', 'Top LE', 'Perentesis P', 'Reynolds JC', 'Nelson DL', 'Waldmann TA']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Warren G.

This is particularly true in recognizing the hypogranular variant of AML,M3 (AML, M3m) and distinguishing it from other subtypes. Nonlineage expression of markers (CD1, CD2, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD56) was nonspecific as to AML subtype. Of interest, CD2 coexpression in acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (M4-Eo) was exclusively associated with inversion of chromosome 16 (inv 16) and was not observed in the other M4-Eo's without inv16. We also recognized a previously undescribed M3m with CD56 coexpression, heightening awareness of this entity which needs to be distinguished from the unique subtype of CD56+ AML with otherwise similar immunophenotypic and morphologic characteristics. In addition, nonlineage expression of CD19 alone was exclusively associated with the cytogenetic finding of t (8;21) (q22; q22) and thus may represent a favorable prognostic indicator by FCI.","['Dunphy, C H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Department of Pathology, St. Louis University Health Sciences Center, Missouri 63104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Enzymes)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (naphthylbutyrate esterase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Enzymes/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1999/02/20 03:12,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/20 03:12'],"['1999/02/20 03:12 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/20 03:12 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2825(1999)13:1<19::AID-JCLA4>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2825(1999)13:1<19::aid-jcla4>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 1999;13(1):19-26. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2825(1999)13:1<19::aid-jcla4>3.0.co;2-1.,,PMC6807799,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, three tissue-specific plastin isoforms have been identified. The T isoform (T-plastin) is unique in that it is expressed in all tissues except leukocytes. To investigate how the T-plastin gene is differentially regulated in leukocytes and non-leukocytes, we isolated a genomic clone that included 9 kb of the upstream flanking region, 0.1 kb of the first exon, and 5.9 kb of the first intron. From this clone, we obtained a continuous sequence of 5535 bp, including 3138 bp of the upstream flanking region, the first exon, and 2286 bp of the first intron. A cluster of four transcription initiation sites was located by S1 mapping. A region spanning these sites and extending 1.4 kb into the first intron had the characteristics of a CpG island. Three CG-containing restriction sites within this island were analyzed and found all or variably methylated in four T-plastin-negative leukemia cell lines. In contrast, the same sites were not methylated in three T-plastin-expressing cell lines or in a sample of normal blood lymphocytes. A basal promoter was located 250 bp upstream from the transciption initiation sites. It comprised a CCAAT box, an Sp1 motif, and four AP2 motifs. No TATA or Inr sequence was found. The basal promoter exhibited weak activity when assayed in fibrosarcoma cells. Stronger promoter activities were found in the presence of the SV40 enhancer or a T-plastin enhancer located some 500 bp from the basal promoter. In T-plastin-negative leukemia cells, the T-plastin basal promoter could be activated by the SV40 enhancer but not by the T-plastin enhancer.

After a hematological examination the illness was diagnosed as T-cell-type acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Chemotherapy was given immediately and general improvement of ALL was observed. Eleven months after the first presentation visual acuity of the right eye was 0.7 and of the left eye 0.3. The central lesion was completely resorbed and revealed paramacular pigment clumping. CONCLUSION: Because of the differentiated and improved therapy schemata available now, e.g., the ALL-BFM 95 protocol, ALL can be cured more frequently. The prognosis, however, is essentially dependent on early diagnosis. By being familiar with the corresponding ocular findings, an ophthalmologist can contribute to this.","['Dutschke, K', 'Siebenburger, H', 'Schrader, W']","['Dutschke K', 'Siebenburger H', 'Schrader W']",['Universitats-Augenklinik Wurzburg.'],['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ophthalmologe,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,9206148,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis', 'Macula Lutea/*pathology', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/diagnosis', 'Vision, Low/*etiology']",,1999/02/20 00:00,1999/02/20 00:01,['1999/02/20 00:00'],"['1999/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s003470050362 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmologe. 1998 Dec;95(12):831-4. doi: 10.1007/s003470050362.,,,,Akute lymphatische Leukamie der T-Zellreihe.

An unusual case of ATL is presented. A fifty-one-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital because of nasal obstruction and blindness in the left eye. Imaging study revealed a mass lesion in the nasal cavity, the left paranasal sinus extending to the left orbit and intracranial frontal base. Biopsy of the mass from the paranasal sinus was carried out and the histological diagnosis was a granulomatous lesion with non-specific inflammation. The clinical impression of the lesion was lethal midline granuloma. After steroid therapy and 50 Gy of local radiotherapy, the patient's symptoms disappeared except for his blindness in the left eye. Imaging study revealed that the mass lesion had become smaller. In spite of local improvement, new lesions such as cervical lymph node swelling and multiple nodular shadows in the lung fields appeared on CT scan. Histological diagnosis of the biopsied cervical lymph node was T-cell dominant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the diffuse type. Serologically, anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive. Southern blot analysis of lymph node biopsy showed monoclonal proliferation of ATL cells. We made the diagnosis of our case as ATL. The patient died 16 months later despite repeated systemic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and prednisolone. ATL can involve the central nervous system (CNS) and manifest CNS symptoms. The neurosurgeon also should consider the CNS involvement of ATL especially in Japan.","['Hayashi, K', 'Anda, T', 'Yasunaga, A', 'Shibata, S', 'Sadamori, N', 'Kisikawa, M', 'Tsuda, N']","['Hayashi K', 'Anda T', 'Yasunaga A', 'Shibata S', 'Sadamori N', 'Kisikawa M', 'Tsuda N']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Juzenkai Hospital, Nagasaki-shi, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,No Shinkei Geka,No shinkei geka.

In these patients mutations affect both alleles of the A-T gene (ATM). We have looked for mutations in the ATM gene in sporadic cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). METHODS: 32 cases of B-CLL were analysed by restriction endonuclease fingerprinting to detect mutations within ATM. In six of the cases in which mutations were detected in tumour samples, germline DNA was screened to assess ATM carrier status. The samples in 20 cases were also studied by western blot for abnormal expression of ATM protein. FINDINGS: Expression of the ATM protein was impaired in eight (40%) of the 20 tumours analysed, being absent in three and decreased in five. Mutations within ATM were detected in six (18%) of the 32 patients. These point mutations, deletions, and one insertion were distributed across the coding sequence of ATM. Germline mutations, which indicate ATM carrier status, were found in two of these six patients compared with a frequency within the general population of below 1 in 200. INTERPRETATION: Abnormal expression of ATM protein is a frequent finding in B-CLL. Although the precise function of this protein is unknown, it is thought to have a role in programmed cell death, a deficiency of which would fit with the characteristic phenotype of prolonged cell survival seen in B-CLL tumour cells. Our results also suggest that carriers of ATM mutations may be at a particular risk for the development of B-CLL and this may partly explain the known genetic susceptibility to this disease.","['Stankovic, T', 'Weber, P', 'Stewart, G', 'Bedenham, T', 'Murray, J', 'Byrd, P J', 'Moss, P A', 'Taylor, A M']","['Stankovic T', 'Weber P', 'Stewart G', 'Bedenham T', 'Murray J', 'Byrd PJ', 'Moss PA', 'Taylor AM']","['CRC Institute for Cancer Studies, Medical School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'VAP-cyclo protocol']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/complications/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(98)10117-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(98)10117-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1999 Jan 2;353(9146):26-9. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)10117-4.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,"['Lancet. 1999 Jan 2;353(9146):3.

Most studies find trisomy 12 to be the most frequent chromosome aberration, followed by structural aberrations of the long arm of chromosomes 13 and 14. Trisomy 12 and the ""14q+"" marker are associated with shorter survival times, while the patients with 13q abnormalities have a favorable outcome, similar to those with a normal karyotype. The development of molecular cytogenetic techniques has greatly improved our ability to detect chromosome aberrations in tumor cells. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosome aberrations can be detected not only in dividing cells but also in interphase nuclei, an approach referred to as interphase cytogenetics. The prevalence of specific aberrations in B-CLL is currently being reassessed by interphase cytogenetics. By far the most frequent abnormality are deletions involving chromosome band 13q14, followed by deletions of the genomic region 11q22.3-q23.1, trisomy 12, deletions of 6q21-q23, and deletions/mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene at 17p13. The evaluation of the true incidence of these aberrations now provides the basis for more accurate correlations with clinical characteristics and outcome. Deletions/mutations of the TP53 gene have been shown to be associated with resistance to treatment and to be an independent marker for poor survival. 11q deletions have been associated with extensive nodal involvement, rapid disease progression, and short survival times. Whether trisomy 12, 13q14, and 6q deletions have a prognostic impact awaits further study. The application of these molecular cytogenetic techniques will also contribute to the identification of the pathogenetically relevant genes that are affected by the chromosome aberrations in B-CLL.","['Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Dohner, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Lichter, P']","['Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner K', 'Bentz M', 'Lichter P']","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding/methods', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",123,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001090050350 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 1999 Feb;77(2):266-81. doi: 10.1007/s001090050350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors report their experience with an intraventricular concentration times time (C x T) chemotherapy regimen for recurrent meningeal leukemia and lymphoma. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (median age, 11.6 years) received C x T therapy for meningeal acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 18), Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 2), or undifferentiated leukemia (n = 1). Prior therapy included standard intrathecal (IT) methotrexate and cytarabine, cranial or craniospinal radiation (median, 24 Gy), and 0-5 experimental treatment modalities. C x T induction therapy consisted of 2 mg of intraventricular methotrexate administered daily for 3 days every 10 days, for 4 courses. Patients were then consolidated with 4 courses of alternating intraventricular cytarabine (15 mg/day) or methotrexate (2 mg/day) daily for 3 days every 2 weeks (2 courses of methotrexate and 2 courses of cytarabine). Maintenance therapy consisted of alternating monthly courses of C x T methotrexate or cytarabine. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of patients (14 of 15) who were evaluable for response achieved a complete remission in a median of 10 days (range, 2-40 days). Median remission duration was 15 months. Fourteen patients died of recurrent disease or systemic treatment-related complications; 2 patients are alive, off treatment, and in continuous complete remission for 59+ and 89+ months; 1 patient experienced a meningeal relapse at 24 months on C x T therapy but was reinduced with the C x T regimen, received craniospinal radiation, and is in remission at 142+ months; and 3 are alive with disease at 32+, 72+, and 81+ months.

RESULTS: The authors found p53 mutations in 7 patients, loss of heterozygosity in 1 patient, and both mutation and loss of heterozygosity in 1 patient. Mutations were demonstrated in the primary tumors only in two patients and in the secondary tumors only in three patients. Two patients had a mutation in both the primary and the secondary tumor; in both patients the two mutations were in different exons. Microsatellite instability (MIN) was identified in five to seven loci in the secondary tumors of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The observed MIN is compatible with the presence of a mutator phenotype that predisposes these children to the development of secondary malignancies.","['Gafanovich, A', 'Ramu, N', 'Krichevsky, S', ""Pe'er, J"", 'Amir, G', 'Ben-Yehuda, D']","['Gafanovich A', 'Ramu N', 'Krichevsky S', ""Pe'er J"", 'Amir G', 'Ben-Yehuda D']","['Hematology Department, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,1999/02/19 04:30,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/19 04:30'],"['1999/02/19 04:30 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/19 04:30 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<504::AID-CNCR32>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jan 15;85(2):504-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commonly, these complications arise during increasing leukocyte counts (WBCs). METHODS: The authors describe four patients with AML and hyperleukocytosis who developed leukostasis followed by parenchymal hemorrhage. RESULTS: Bleeding in all patients occurred while their WBCs were decreasing following cytosine-arabinoside chemotherapy, and in the absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation or severe thrombocytopenia. Radiologic and histopathologic findings underscoring possible mechanisms are presented in the article. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of cell adhesion associated with chemotherapy-induced blast lysis or cellular differentiation are possible factors contributing to this particular sequence (cytosine arabinoside-based chemotherapy, leukostasis, and subsequent hemorrhage). Prophylactic measures for managing this early complication of AML treatment include leukapheresis to reduce the WBC prior to the initiation of chemotherapy.","['Wurthner, J U', 'Kohler, G', 'Behringer, D', 'Lindemann, A', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Lubbert, M']","['Wurthner JU', 'Kohler G', 'Behringer D', 'Lindemann A', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/*complications', 'Leukostasis/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",,1999/02/19 04:30,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/19 04:30'],"['1999/02/19 04:30 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/19 04:30 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<368::AID-CNCR14>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<368::aid-cncr14>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jan 15;85(2):368-74. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<368::aid-cncr14>3.0.co;2-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tested the efficacy and toxicity of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and intermediate dose cytarabine (MEC) with cyclosporine (CSP) as an MDR modulator in patients with recurrent and refractory acute myeloid leukemia, and also correlated P-gp expression in leukemia cells with response. METHODS: Thirty-eight eligible patients who were in first recurrence after < 6 months of complete remission (CR) (11 patients), refractory to initial induction therapy or to one attempt at reinduction after recurrence (18 patients), in second recurrence (4 patients), or in recurrence after either allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (5 patients) received either MEC alone (13 patients) or MEC-CSP (25 patients). CSP was given as a loading dose of 6 mg/kg for 2 hours intravenously (i.v.) starting 2 hours before the first dose of etoposide, followed by a continuous i.v. infusion of 18 mg/kg/day for 98 hours. RESULTS: Three of the 13 patients (23%) who received MEC achieved CR, as did 6 of the 25 patients (24%) who received MEC-CSP. The median remission duration for all patients who achieved CR was 149 days (range, 26-466 days), 91 days (range, 81-172 days) for the 3 patients who received MEC, and 189.5 days (range, 26-466 days) for the patients treated with MEC-CSP. The median survival for the patients treated with MEC and MEC-CSP was 104 and 72 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No significant association was found between P-gp expression and response.

In this study, the authors investigated possible cell type and differentiation stage specificity of expression of FR-beta in normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells. METHODS: An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for FR-beta was employed for immunostaining representative bone marrow smears and peripheral blood smears from normal individuals and from a limited number of patients with various leukemias. Multiple samples of normal bone marrow and peripheral blood were analyzed for the expression of FR-beta and selected CD antigens by two- or three-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: Of the morphologically identifiable cells, only neutrophils were positive for FR-beta. The leukemic blasts in CML patients showed expression of FR-beta with no apparent relation to the occurrence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Among acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, FR-beta was expressed in promyelocytic leukemia, in the myeloblast populations of myelomonocytic and erythroleukemias, and variably in M1/M2 AML. Neither the blasts of acute lymphocytic leukemia nor the more mature cells of chronic lymphocytic and hairy cell leukemias expressed FR-beta. The less differentiated FR-beta positive AML samples also were positive for CD34 and HLA-DR. Flow cytometric analysis of normal bone marrow and peripheral blood revealed low or insignificant coexpression of FR-beta with CD34, CD19, and CD3, whereas significant coexpression was observed with high levels of CD33, CD13, and CD11b; coexpression of FR-beta with CD14 was high in the immature bone marrow cells, comparable to that in myeloid cells, but relatively low in peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest a narrow expression pattern of FR-beta marking the neutrophilic lineage and the possibility of defining a subtype or subtypes of myeloid leukemia based on FR-beta expression. The identification of FR-beta positive leukemias and the absence of the receptor in normal CD34 positive cells may enable selective receptor-mediated targeting of leukemic cells.","['Ross, J F', 'Wang, H', 'Behm, F G', 'Mathew, P', 'Wu, M', 'Booth, R', 'Ratnam, M']","['Ross JF', 'Wang H', 'Behm FG', 'Mathew P', 'Wu M', 'Booth R', 'Ratnam M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo 43614-5804, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cricetinae', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Rabbits', '*Receptors, Cell Surface']",,1999/02/19 04:30,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/19 04:30'],"['1999/02/19 04:30 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/19 04:30 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<348::AID-CNCR12>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<348::aid-cncr12>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jan 15;85(2):348-57. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<348::aid-cncr12>3.0.co;2-4.,['R0ICA70873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm these reports, the relationship between survival and QOL, as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire and Duke-UNC Social Support Scale, was examined within a group of 206 patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma treated in a randomized clinical trial conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 8931). METHODS: Patients completed the EORTC instrument and the Duke-UNC Social Support Scale at baseline in the clinic. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the incremental contribution QOL provided in predicting survival beyond the effect of known clinical prognostic variables. RESULTS: Clinical factors that were jointly predictive of poorer survival included low performance status, nonadenocarcinoma histology, presence of dyspnea, weight loss greater than 5%, albumin level less than 3.5 mg/dL, and adrenal metastases. Univariate analyses showed that patient-reported EORTC subscales describing increased pain, appetite loss, fatigue, lung carcinoma symptoms, poorer overall QOL, and poorer physical functioning predicted significantly poorer survival. Multivariate analyses showed that, after adjustment for clinical factors, overall QOL was not a significant predictor of survival. Rather, the only EORTC subscale of prognostic importance was the pain subscale, in which a 40-point increase was associated with a 27% increase in the hazard rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm the prognostic importance of overall QOL. Rather, after adjustment for significant clinical factors, a patient-provided pain report had the greatest prognostic importance.","['Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Fleishman, S', 'Kornblith, A B', 'Kosty, M', 'Green, M R', 'Holland, J']","['Herndon JE 2nd', 'Fleishman S', 'Kornblith AB', 'Kosty M', 'Green MR', 'Holland J']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/diagnosis/*mortality/secondary', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis']",,1999/02/19 04:30,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/19 04:30'],"['1999/02/19 04:30 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/19 04:30 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<333::AID-CNCR10>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<333::aid-cncr10>3.0.co;2-q [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jan 15;85(2):333-40. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990115)85:2<333::aid-cncr10>3.0.co;2-q.,"['CA11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that chimeric MLL proteins localize in the nuclei in a fashion similar to that of MLL protein even if the partner gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein and indicated the importance of the N-terminal portion of MLL common to various MLL translocations. This time we established an inducible expression system for chimeric MLL-LTG9 and truncated N-terminal MLL proteins (MLL-Zf(-)) in 32Dcl3 cells. By utilizing this system, we were able to show inhibition of Hox a7, Hox b7 and Hox c9 genes' expression by induced MLL-LTG9 and MLL-Zf(-). Up-regulation of Hox a7, Hox b7 and Hox c9 was observed when 32Dcl3 cells were cultured with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in place of interleukin 3 and induction of MLL-LTG9 and MLL-Zf(-) was shown to suppress this upregulation. At the same time, expression of two mammalian Polycomb group genes, M33 and mel-18, which both reportedly affect Hox genes' expression, was not inhibited by MLL-LTG9 and MLL-Zf(-) induction. These results indicate that MLL has an important effect on the expression of at least some Hox genes in hematopoietic cells and suggest that inhibition of the proper expression of Hox genes by chimeric MLL proteins may dysregulate hematopoietic cell differentiation and proliferation, which then can lead to leukemogenesis.","['Joh, T', 'Hosokawa, Y', 'Suzuki, R', 'Takahashi, T', 'Seto, M']","['Joh T', 'Hosokawa Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Takahashi T', 'Seto M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA7 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa7 protein, mouse)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202400 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 28;18(4):1125-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fusion of the Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) (also called the pointed) domain of TEL to AML1 has been suggested to convert AML1 from a transcriptional activator to a repressor. To define the structural features of this chimeric protein required for repression, we analysed the transcriptional activity of a series of TEL-AML1 mutants on the AML1-responsive interleukin-3 (IL-3) promoter, a potentially relevant gene target. Our results demonstrate that TEL-AML1 represses basal IL-3 promoter activity in lymphoid cells, and deletion mutant analysis identified three distinct domains of TEL-AML1 that are required for repression; the HLH (pointed) motif contained in the TEL portion of TEL-AML1, and both the runt homology domain (Rhd) and the 74 amino acids downstream of the Rhd that are present in the AML1 portion of the fusion protein. Although AML1B (and a shorter AML1 isoform, AML1A) have transcriptional activating activity on the IL-3 promoter, fusion of the AML1 gene to the TEL gene generates a repressor of IL-3 expression. Consistent with this activity, freshly isolated human ALL cells that contain TEL-AML1 do not express IL-3.","['Uchida, H', 'Downing, J R', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Frank, R', 'Zhang, J', 'Nimer, S D']","['Uchida H', 'Downing JR', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Frank R', 'Zhang J', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202383 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 28;18(4):1015-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202383.,"['CA 70388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 52208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adult tissues, LYL1 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells with the notable exclusion of the T cell lineage. LYL1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein highly related to TAL-1, whose activation is also associated with a high proportion of human T-ALLs. A yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that specifically interact with LYL1 and might mediate its activities. We found that p105, the precursor of NF-kappaB1 p50, was the major LYL1-interacting protein in this system. The association between LYL1 and p105 was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. Biochemical studies indicated that the interaction was mediated by the bHLH motif of LYL1 and the ankyrin-like motifs of p105. Ectopic expression of LYL1 in a human T cell line caused a significant decrease in NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, associated with a reduced level of NF-kappaB1 proteins.","['Ferrier, R', 'Nougarede, R', 'Doucet, S', 'Kahn-Perles, B', 'Imbert, J', 'Mathieu-Mahul, D']","['Ferrier R', 'Nougarede R', 'Doucet S', 'Kahn-Perles B', 'Imbert J', 'Mathieu-Mahul D']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, UMR 5535, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (LYL1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202374 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 28;18(4):995-1005. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202374.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML NBs are disorganized in acute promyelocytic leukemia and during several DNA virus infections. In particular, the HSV-1 ICP0 protein is known to delocalize PML from NBs. Thus, NBs could play an important role in oncogenesis, IFN response and viral infections. Here, we show that HSV-1 induced PML protein degradation without altering its mRNA level. This degradation was time- and multiplicity of infection-dependent. Sp100 protein was also degraded, while another SUMO-1 conjugated protein, RanGAP1 and the IFN-induced protein kinase PKR were not.

Secondly, to examine the relation between disease patterns and available occupational data in male subjects of working age. DESIGN: A census survey of all cases occurring in the three counties in the Western Health Board (WHB) area, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, for the 11 year period 1980 to 1990 inclusive. Average annual age standardised incidence rates for the period were calculated using the 1986 census data. Rates for the area are compared with rates from the southern region of Ireland, which had a tumour registry. Trends over the time period are evaluated. All male subjects for whom occupational data were available were categorised using the Irish socioeconomic group classification and incidence rates by occupation were compared using the standardised incidence ratio method. In one of the counties, Galway, a detailed occupational history of selected cases and an age matched control group was also elicited through patients' general practitioners. SETTING: All available case records in the West of Ireland. RESULTS: There are no national incidence records for the period. Compared with data from the Southern Tumour Registry, the number of cases of women with myeloid leukaemias was significantly lower. Male leukaemia rates were significantly lower as a group (SIR 84 (95% CI 74, 95) but not when considered as individual categories. Regression analysis revealed an increasing trend in the number of new cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among both men (r = 0.47, p = 0.02) and women (r = 0.90, p = 0.0001) and of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in men (r = 0.77, p = 0.005) and women (r = 0.68 p = 0.02) in the WHB region over the last decade. Four hundred and fifty six male cases over the age of 15 years were identified and adequate occupational information was available for 74% of these. Standardised incidence ratios of testicular tumours 100, 938) and agriworkers other than farmers (SIR 377, 95% CI 103, 967). There were also significantly increased incidence ratios for both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR 169, 95% CI 124, 266) and three categories of leukaemias among farmers. Hodgkin's disease and acute myeloid leukaemias were significantly increased among semi-skilled people. Interview data with 90 cases and 54 controls of both sexes revealed that among farmers, cases (n = 31) were significantly less likely than controls (n = 20) to use tractor mounted spraying techniques (OR = 0.19 (95% CI 0.04, 0.80)) and less likely to wear protective masks (OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05, 0.84)). CONCLUSIONS: Trends of increase in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and some leukaemias are consistent with studies elsewhere. The study provides further evidence of the relation between agricultural work and certain lymphoproliferative cancers. The possible carcinogenic role of chemicals used in agricultural industries must be considered as an explanation.","['Kelleher, C', 'Newell, J', 'MacDonagh-White, C', 'MacHale, E', 'Egan, E', 'Connolly, E', 'Gough, H', 'Delaney, B', 'Shryane, E']","['Kelleher C', 'Newell J', 'MacDonagh-White C', 'MacHale E', 'Egan E', 'Connolly E', 'Gough H', 'Delaney B', 'Shryane E']","['Department of Health Promotion, National University of Ireland, Galway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology/etiology"", 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Ireland/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology']",,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.52.10.651 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1998 Oct;52(10):651-6. doi: 10.1136/jech.52.10.651.,,PMC1756621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cryostat sections of OCT embedded diagnostic nodal material from NHL patients and cryopreserved mononuclear preparations from CLL patients were used as sources of RNA. After reverse transcription, PCR was carried out with amplimers positioned at either side of the variant exon insertion site to amplify all possible CD44 isoforms. Those isoforms containing v6 were identified after Southern blotting and hybridisation with a radiolabelled oligonucleotide. RESULTS: Of 32 NHL samples analysed, 16 did not express CD44 isoforms containing v6, six expressed an isoform containing exon v6 alone, and 10 expressed v6 long isoforms which contained exon v6 in addition to other variant exons. These data did not correlate with lymphoma classification, disease staging, or the presence or absence of extranodal disease. However, those patients expressing v6 long CD44 isoforms had a worse overall survival than those that did not. The plateau of the survival curves was 50% compared with 82%. No v6 long isoforms were detected in the 21 CLL samples investigated.

Ectopic expression of HLF as an E2A-HLF fusion protein in t(17;19)-positive human pro-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias is believed to promote malignancy by interfering with apoptosis. While HLF has been linked to malignancies of the lymphoid system, it is not normally expressed in these cells. Rather, HLF transcripts are detected in the liver, kidney, lung and adult nervous system by Northern blotting. Despite the links to cell death, little is known of the distribution or function of HLF in the adult and developing mammalian nervous system. Therefore, we cloned mouse Hlf and studied its expression by in situ hybridization. During embryonic brain development, Hlf expression was restricted to the anterior pituitary and meninges. By early postnatal life, Hlf was highly expressed in somatosensory cortex, thalamic nuclei, and structures arising from ectodermal placodes. Subsequently, Hlf expression increased in the central nervous system and was found throughout the brain by adulthood. In the developing pituitary gland, Hlf was highly expressed in the rostral tip of the anterior lobe. This pattern is similar to that of Tef, an Hlf-related bZIP protein. However, while Tef is expressed in the anterior pituitary of the adult mouse, Hlf was detected in both the anterior and posterior pituitary. Hlf expression was not associated with cells undergoing programmed cell death in the nervous system.

Bcl-2 over-expression is associated with CD34 positivity, poor response to chemotherapy and reduced overall survival in AML patients. The role of Bcl-2 in determining the response of AML cells to two chemotherapy drugs used in treatment of AML: cytarabine and fludarabine was investigated using human leukaemia cell lines expressing different levels of Bcl-2: U937 CD34 negative expressing low levels of Bcl-2 and MHH225 CD34 positive expressing high levels of Bcl-2. Apoptosis was significantly more in CD34 negative cells with low Bcl-2 expression than in CD34 positive cells with high Bcl-2 expression. The IC50 of cytarabine and fludarabine were significantly higher in CD34 positive cells with high Bcl-2 than in CD34 negative cells with low Bcl-2. Using a quantitative ELISA assay, the results revealed a 2-log higher Bcl-2 concentrations in CD34 positive (144.7 13.3 Units per 105 cells) than in CD34 negative (6.3 0.01 Units per 104 cells) leukaemia cells. Both cytarabine and fludarabine have reduced Bcl-2 concentrations in both cell types. However, the significantly high basal level of Bcl-2 concentrations in CD34 positive leukaemia cells has resulted in a persistent high Bcl-2 concentration levels remaining after treatment with the anti-leukaemia drugs in these cells. Whereas in CD34 negative leukaemia cells the low basal level of Bcl-2 concentrations was significantly reduced by the anti-leukaemia drugs to extremely low levels. Therefore, the high Bcl-2 concentration levels remaining after treatment with anti-leukaemia drugs can be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy by protecting CD34 positive AML cells from induced apoptosis.","['Ahmed, N', 'Sammons, J', 'Hassan, H T']","['Ahmed N', 'Sammons J', 'Hassan HT']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton WV1 1DJ, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",,1999/02/19 00:00,1999/02/19 00:01,['1999/02/19 00:00'],"['1999/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.6.2.403 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 1999 Mar-Apr;6(2):403-7. doi: 10.3892/or.6.2.403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was originally proposed that Op18 specifically regulates dynamic properties of MTs by associating with tubulin, but it has subsequently been proposed that Op18 acts simply by sequestering of tubulin heterodimers. We have dissected the mechanistic action of Op18 by generation of two distinct classes of mutants. One class has interruptions of the heptad repeats of a potential coiled-coil region of Op18, and the other involves substitution at all four phosphorylation sites with negatively charged Glu residues. Both types of mutation result in Op18 proteins with a limited decrease in tubulin complex formation. However, the MT-destabilizing activities of the coiled-coil mutants are more severely reduced in transfected leukemia cells than those of the Glu-substituted Op18 derivative, providing evidence for tubulin-directed regulatory activities distinct from tubulin complex formation. Analysis of Op18-mediated regulation of tubulin GTPase activity and taxol-promoted tubulin polymerization showed that while wild-type and Glu-substituted Op18 derivatives are active, the coiled-coil mutants are essentially inactive. This suggests that Op18-tubulin contact involves structural motifs that deliver a signal of regulatory importance to the MT system.","['Larsson, N', 'Segerman, B', 'Gradin, H M', 'Wandzioch, E', 'Cassimeris, L', 'Gullberg, M']","['Larsson N', 'Segerman B', 'Gradin HM', 'Wandzioch E', 'Cassimeris L', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Cell Extracts', 'Humans', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stathmin', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.3.2242 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Mar;19(3):2242-50. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.3.2242.,,PMC84017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key step in HTLV-I-induced leukemigenesis is induction of abnormal T-cell growth and survival. Unlike antigen-stimulated T cells, which cease proliferation after a finite number of cell division, HTLV-I-infected T cells proliferate indefinitely (immortalized), thus facilitating occurrence of secondary genetic changes leading to malignant transformation. To explore the molecular basis of HTLV-I-induced abnormal T-cell survival, we compared the gene expression profiles of normal and HTLV-I-immortalized T cells using 'gene array'. These studies revealed a strikingly altered expression pattern of a large number of genes along with HTLV-I-mediated T-cell immortalization. Interestingly, many of these deregulated genes are involved in the control of programmed cell death or apoptosis. These findings indicate that disruption of the cellular apoptosis-regulatory network may play a role in the HTLV-I-mediated oncogenesis.","['Harhaj, E W', 'Good, L', 'Xiao, G', 'Sun, S C']","['Harhaj EW', 'Good L', 'Xiao G', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202405 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Feb 11;18(6):1341-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202405.,['R01 CA68471-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that JNK1/SAPK regulates genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in p53-negative U937 cells by activating caspases. c-Abl is expected to act upstream of JNK1/SAPK activation upon treatment with genotoxic stressors, but its involvement in apoptosis development is still unclear. We herein investigated the kinase activities of c-Abl and JNK1/SAPK during apoptosis elicited by genotoxic anticancer drugs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in U937 cells and their apoptosis-resistant variant UK711 cells. We found that the activation of JNK1/SAPK and c-Abl correlated well with apoptosis development in these cell lines. Unexpectedly, however, the JNK1/SAPK activation preceded the c-Abl activation. Moreover, the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp suppressed c-Abl activation and the onset of apoptosis but not the JNK1/SAPK activation. Interestingly, c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibition by CGP 57148 reduced apoptosis without interfering with JNK1/SAPK activation. These results indicate that c-Abl acts not upstream of JNK1/ SAPK but downstream of caspases during the development of p53-independent apoptosis and is possibly involved in accelerating execution of the cell death pathway.","['Dan, S', 'Naito, M', 'Seimiya, H', 'Kizaki, A', 'Mashima, T', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Dan S', 'Naito M', 'Seimiya H', 'Kizaki A', 'Mashima T', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202423 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Feb 11;18(6):1277-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202423.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results also indicated that in contrast to retroviral vector-packageable RNAs, the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of both Gag-Pol and Env packaging functions had limited impact on retroviral titers. The primary mechanism suspected is the premature intracellular cleavage of the Pr65gag precursor that we found in gag-pol-expressing cells, which in turn may impair the normal incorporation of high loads of functional Env. Last, the characterization of the adenoviral/retroviral chimeric vectors allowed the screening of various primate cells for retroviral production and we found that three hepatocyte-derived cell lines were highly efficient in the assembly and release of infectious retroviral particles.","['Duisit, G', 'Salvetti, A', 'Moullier, P', 'Cosset, F L']","['Duisit G', 'Salvetti A', 'Moullier P', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Therapie Genique, CHU Hotel Dieu, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'CD2 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera/genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Assembly']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950018986 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jan 20;10(2):189-200. doi: 10.1089/10430349950018986.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This system was initially optimized by gene transfer using different retroviral envelope proteins into activated human CD4+ T lymphocytes in vitro. Higher titer and infectivity were obtained than with stable murine producer lines; titers of 0.3-1 x 10(7) infectious units per milliliter for vectors encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were achieved. Virions pseudotyped with envelope proteins from gibbon ape leukemia virus or amphotropic murine leukemia virus resulted in gene transfer of > or = 50% in CD4+ human T lymphocytes with this marker. Gene transfer of Rev M10 with this vector conferred resistance to HIV infection compared with negative controls in the absence of drug selection. Thus, the efficiency of transduction achieved under these conditions obviated the need to include selection to detect biologic effects in T cells. Finally, a protocol for the production of large-scale supernatants using transient transfection was optimized up to titers of 1.9 x 10(7) IU/ml.

Retroviral vectors have been extensively used to deliver foreign genes to mammalian cells and improvement of transduction protocols remains dependent on markers that can be rapidly monitored and used for efficient selection of transduced cells. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is a suitable reporter molecule for gene expression because of its lack of cytotoxicity and stable fluorescence signal that can be readily detected by flow cytometry. However, attempts to adapt the GFP system to stable transduction of human lymphocytes have not been satisfactory. In this article, transductions of primary human T lymphocytes were performed using cell-free supernatants from a PG13 packaging cell line in which a retroviral vector expressing EGFP was pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope. Using this system combined with a fibronectin-facilitated protocol, primary lymphocytes were transduced with a mean gene transfer efficiency of 27.5% following a 2-day stimulation with either PHA or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Conditions that increased the entry of lymphocytes into cell cycle did not consistently correlate with enhanced gene transfer, indicating that factors other than proliferation are important for optimal retroviral gene transfer. These results demonstrate the utility of EGFP as a marker for human T cell transduction and will enable further optimization of T cell gene therapy protocols.","['Dardalhon, V', 'Noraz, N', 'Pollok, K', 'Rebouissou, C', 'Boyer, M', 'Bakker, A Q', 'Spits, H', 'Taylor, N']","['Dardalhon V', 'Noraz N', 'Pollok K', 'Rebouissou C', 'Boyer M', 'Bakker AQ', 'Spits H', 'Taylor N']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Universite Montpellier II, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/analysis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950019147 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jan 1;10(1):5-14. doi: 10.1089/10430349950019147.,['P01 HL 53586/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that the hygroscopic polymer poly (ethylene glycol), PEG, promotes the infectivity of cells by SFV under conditions that did not promote cell-cell fusion. We also found that the PEG-induced infection and expression of an exogenous protein (green fluorescent protein, GFP) did not elevate the basal tyrosine kinase activity, induce a stress-activated responses, or result in aberrant cell responses. Expression of GFP tagged-Vav, an activator of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK), resulted in the expected induction of JNK activity and in the normal redistribution of Vav in response to engagement of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI). Thus, our findings that PEG allows the infection of non-permissive cells by SFV makes this system extremely attractive for expression of proteins in mammalian cells, and studies on signal transduction and cellular localization in immune and non-immune cells.","['Arudchandran, R', 'Brown, M J', 'Song, J S', 'Wank, S A', 'Haleem-Smith, H', 'Rivera, J']","['Arudchandran R', 'Brown MJ', 'Song JS', 'Wank SA', 'Haleem-Smith H', 'Rivera J']","['Section on Chemical Immunology, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pharmaceutic Aids)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vav1 protein, rat)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Animals', 'COS Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Cricetinae', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Kidney/metabolism/virology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/virology', 'Luminescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pharmaceutic Aids/*pharmacology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Sorting Signals/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Semliki forest virus/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(98)00161-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(98)00161-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1999 Jan 1;222(1-2):197-208. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(98)00161-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTLD may develop in up to 10% of pediatric transplant recipients with mortality rates up to 80%. The authors report their experience with the diagnosis and efficacy of aggressive sequential management of PTLD in five patients under age 5 years. METHODS: A review of 75 pediatric liver transplant recipients on FK-506-based immunosuppression identified five biopsy-proven cases of PTLD and one probable case (8%). The probable case was a teenager, 6 months posttransplant in Spain, with mediastinal masses. No treatment or diagnosis was sought, and the patient died. The other five cases were managed with sequential therapy on an ""intent-to-treat"" basis with initial withdrawal of immunosuppression. If the disease progressed, patients were treated with four courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and intrathecal methotrexate and ara-C. RESULTS: Five children were anti-EBV titer negative at the time of transplant. Three of five received EBV-positive donor organs and two children received EBV-negative livers. Monoclonal PTLD developed between 2 and 31 months posttransplant (mean, 15.7 months). With onset of PTLD (four B cell lymphoma, one B cell leukemia) all patients had tapering or withdrawal of immunosuppression and initiation of highdose acyclovir. Two of five patients had complete remission and resumed immunosuppression. Two patients progressed and required chemotherapy. One patient with initial response relapsed 4 months later with B cell leukemia and required chemotherapy. All five patients are alive 10 to 38 months postdiagnosis (mean, 29 months). Three patients had rejection requiring resumption of FK-506 therapy. Two patients are maintained on low-dose alternate-day prednisone and no FK-506. All patients have normal liver function. Central nervous system lymphoma developed in one child with significant neurological sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: PTLD can develop in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Early withdrawal of immunosuppression and aggressive chemotherapy enabled us to achieve 100% patient and graft survival.","['Praghakaran, K', 'Wise, B', 'Chen, A', 'Schwarz, K', 'Colombani, P']","['Praghakaran K', 'Wise B', 'Chen A', 'Schwarz K', 'Colombani P']","['Department of Surgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*etiology/therapy', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3468(99)90239-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(99)90239-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1999 Jan;34(1):112-5; discussion 115-6. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(99)90239-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a large number of substrates and interacting proteins of Bcr-Abl have been identified, it remains unclear whether Bcr-Abl assembles multi-protein complexes and if it does where these complexes are within cells. We have investigated the localization of Bcr-Abl in 32D myeloid cells attached to the extracellular matrix. We have found that Bcr-Abl displays a polarized distribution, colocalizing with a subset of filamentous actin at trailing portions of migrating 32D cells, and localizes on the cortical F-actin and on vesicle-like structures in resting 32D cells. Deletion of the actin binding domain of Bcr-Abl (Bcr-AbI-AD) dramatically enhances the localization of Bcr-Abl on the vesicle-like structures. These distinct localization patterns of Bcr-Abl and Bcr-Abl-AD enabled us to examine the localization of Bcr-Abl substrate and interacting proteins in relation to Bcr-Abl. We found that a subset of biochemically defined target proteins of Bcr-Abl redistributed and co-localized with Bcr-Abl on F-actin and on vesicle-like structures. The co-localization of signaling proteins with Bcr-Abl at its sites of localization supports the idea that Bcr-Abl forms a multi-protein signaling complex, while the polarized distribution and vesicle-like localization of Bcr-Abl may play a role in leukemogenesis.","['Skourides, P A', 'Perera, S A', 'Ren, R']","['Skourides PA', 'Perera SA', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center and Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02254-9110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Actins/isolation & purification', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Movement', '*Cell Polarity', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202407 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Feb 4;18(5):1165-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202407.,['CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a product of MDR1 gene called P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp is responsible for cell resistance to cytotoxic compounds of natural origin, such as anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, taxanes, colchicine and amsacrine. There were also identified not Pgp-dependent multidrug resistance mechanisms (non-Pgp MDR) in AML. All mentioned above drugs are involved but not taxol. Non-Pgp MDR depends on topoisomerase II alfa activity alterations, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) expression and lung resistance-related protein (LRP) expression. Pgp positive AML patients have poorer complete remission (CR) rate, decreased remission duration and overall survival. Pgp expression is detected among 70% AML patients older than 55. The most promising drugs in circumventing classical MDR seems cyclosporin A (CsA) and cyclosporin D (SDZ PCS 833). They are successfully used in refractory and relapsed AML.","['Machaczka, M', 'Rucinska, M', 'Jablonski, M', 'Skotnicki, A B']","['Machaczka M', 'Rucinska M', 'Jablonski M', 'Skotnicki AB']","['Kliniki Hematologii Collegium Medicum, Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego w Krakowie.']",['pol'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8ZD3I5M2HF (cyclosporin D)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate']",53,1999/02/18 00:00,1999/02/18 00:01,['1999/02/18 00:00'],"['1999/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 1998;55(7-8):407-13.,,,,Przyczyny nieskutecznosci leczenia ostrej bialaczki szpikowej--rola opornosci blastow na cytostatyki.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCL is associated with pancytopenia and splenomegaly. In the late 1980s, introduction of new purine analogs such as 2-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin, DCF) and 2-chlorodeoxy-adenosine (2-CdA) significantly improved the prognosis of HCL patients. 33-89% patients can achieve a complete remission (CR) following DCF treatment and 85% CR after 2-CdA therapy. There is no cross-resistance between pentostatin and 2-CdA. Residual hairy cells are present in bone marrow of almost all patients after purine analogs therapy, detected by immunohistochemical methods. It is called minimal residual disease (MRD). The spleen may be the source of MRD after purine analogs therapy. Thus splenectomy could be a profitable approach after chemotherapy. Hairy-cell leukemia relapse appears in 47.8% of cases in 30 months after pentostatin treatment and in 23% of cases in 3 years after 2-CdA therapy. There is no perfect treatment of HCL relapse.

Completeness of the ascertainment of leukemia cases was validated by comparison with estimates derived from official statistics of mortality and survival curves. A significant excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) was found for children residing in the town of Carbonia. The risk was highest in 1983-85, when seven cases occurred versus 0.8 expected. No birth-cohort effect was observed. The cALL incidence rate was significantly higher among children born and residing in Carbonia than among children born in Carbonia but residing elsewhere. However, the cALL cases did not cluster within the town of Carbonia. The proximity of the largest industrial settlement in the region of Sardinia raised the suspicion that environmental pollution was responsible for the observed excess. Information about industrial emissions from this settlement prior to the appearance of the cALL cluster was not sufficient to reject or confirm the hypothesis.","['Cocco', 'Bernardinelli', 'Biddau', 'Montomoli', 'Murgia', 'Rapallo', 'Targhetta', 'Capocaccia', 'Fadda', 'Frova']","['Cocco P', 'Bernardinelli L', 'Biddau P', 'Montomoli C', 'Murgia G', 'Rapallo M', 'Targhetta R', 'Capocaccia R', 'Fadda D', 'Frova L']","['Occupational Studies Section, Environmental Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, 6130 Executive Boulevard, EPN room 418, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Occup Environ Health,International journal of occupational and environmental health,9505217,,,,,1995/07/01 00:00,1999/02/17 00:00,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/17 00:00 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/oeh.1995.1.3.232 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Occup Environ Health. 1995 Jul;1(3):232-238. doi: 10.1179/oeh.1995.1.3.232.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of partially purified fractions from the conditioned media of phorbol ester-treated U-937 cells suggested the existence of unknown endothelial growth inhibitors. Using a combination of copper affinity, heparin affinity, cation exchange, and reversed phase liquid chromatographies, a growth inhibitor for endothelial cells was purified to homogeneity from conditioned media. The purified growth inhibitor migrated as a 65 kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Microsequencing analyses of the tryptic fragments of the growth inhibitor and a BLAST search analysis revealed a unique sequence showing no homology to known proteins. The purified protein inhibited endothelial cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on smooth muscle cell growth. The factor also blocked endothelial cell growth induced by both fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor, and was additively effective in inhibiting the growth of endothelial cells by U-937 cell-derived endothelial cell growth inhibitors.

The modification of sialic acid involves first de-N-acetylation of sialic acid moiety through ubiquitous de-N-acetylation/re-N-acetylation cycle, followed by the dehydrative cyclization of de-N-acetyl sialic acid to form ""cyclic sialic acid."" The enzyme involved in the dehydration of de-N-acetyl sialic acid is a calcium-dependent enzyme having neutral-alkaline pH optimum. De-N-acetyl sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X retained selectin binding activity as well as parental sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X, but cyclic sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X was devoid of selectin binding activity. Sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X carrying the cyclic sialic acid is specifically recognized by the newly generated mAb, G159. The determinant was distributed widely among normal human leukocytes, especially on monocytes and subsets of lymphocytes including NK cells, helper memory T cells, Tcr-gammadelta T cells, and a part of B cells. The determinant was detected also on several cultured lymphocytic leukemia cell lines and O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-activated lymphoid cells. Cyclic sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X is efficiently formed by the action of the partly membrane-bound calcium-dependent enzyme, tentatively called ""sialic acid cyclase,"" and a possible physiological significance of this reaction could be a rapid inactivation of selectin binding activity at the cell surface. Conversely, the accumulated intracellular cyclic sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X determinant may function as a dormant pool of selectin ligands, which, on appropriate stimulation, is hydrolyzed and becomes active in selectin-dependent cell adhesion.","['Mitsuoka, C', 'Ohmori, K', 'Kimura, N', 'Kanamori, A', 'Komba, S', 'Ishida, H', 'Kiso, M', 'Kannagi, R']","['Mitsuoka C', 'Ohmori K', 'Kimura N', 'Kanamori A', 'Komba S', 'Ishida H', 'Kiso M', 'Kannagi R']","['Program of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"[""0 (6'-sulfated sialyl Lewis x)"", '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'L-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Lewis X Antigen/analogs & derivatives', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides/*blood/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen/analogs & derivatives', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1999/02/17 00:00,1999/02/17 00:01,['1999/02/17 00:00'],"['1999/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.4.1597 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Feb 16;96(4):1597-602. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.4.1597.,,PMC15530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deduced product is a 696-aa multiple-membrane spanning molecule, is widely expressed in human tissues, and shares homology with nematode, fly, and plant proteins of unknown function as well as with the yeast SYG1 protein, which has been shown to interact with a G protein.

This xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor (XPR1) is the fourth identified molecule having multiple membrane spanning domains among mammalian type C oncoretrovirus receptors and may play a role in G protein-coupled signal transduction, as do the chemokine receptors required for HIV entry.","['Battini, J L', 'Rasko, J E', 'Miller, A D']","['Battini JL', 'Rasko JE', 'Miller AD']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SYG1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Laboratory', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Diptera', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genetic Markers', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Lod Score', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nematoda', 'Organ Specificity', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",,1999/02/17 00:00,1999/02/17 00:01,['1999/02/17 00:00'],"['1999/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.4.1385 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Feb 16;96(4):1385-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.4.1385.,"['P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC15472,['GENBANK/AF099082'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations introduce premature stop codons, which result in truncation of 82-98 COOH-terminal amino acids of the receptor. SCN patients who develop secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia almost invariably acquired a GCSFR mutation, suggesting that this genetic alteration represents a key step in leukemogenesis. Here we show that an equivalent mutation targeted in mice (gcsfr-Delta715) results in the selective expansion of the G-CSF- responsive progenitor (G-CFC) compartment in the bone marrow. In addition, in vivo treatment of gcsfr-Delta715 mice with G-CSF results in increased production of neutrophils leading to a sustained neutrophilia. This hyperproliferative response to G-CSF is accompanied by prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) complexes and extended cell surface expression of mutant receptors due to defective internalization. In view of the continuous G-CSF treatment of SCN patients, these data provide insight into why progenitor cells expressing truncated receptors clonally expand in vivo, and why these cells may be targets for additional genetic events leading to leukemia.","['Hermans, M H', 'Antonissen, C', 'Ward, A C', 'Mayen, A E', 'Ploemacher, R E', 'Touw, I P']","['Hermans MH', 'Antonissen C', 'Ward AC', 'Mayen AE', 'Ploemacher RE', 'Touw IP']","['Institute of Hematology, Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center and Erasmus University Rotterdam, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands. hermans@hema.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Contraindications', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Milk Proteins', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,1999/02/17 00:00,1999/02/17 00:01,['1999/02/17 00:00'],"['1999/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.189.4.683 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 Feb 15;189(4):683-92. doi: 10.1084/jem.189.4.683.,,PMC2192935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven patients with acute leukemia (n = 5 ALL, n = 1 AML) or lymphoma (n = 1) received primary allogeneic PBPC transplantation, four patients received a second allotransplantation for graft failure (n = 1 AML, n = 1 sickle cell anemia) or disease recurrence (n = 1 ALL, n = 1 MDS). Five donors were HLA-identical siblings, five were 0-1 antigen mismatched family members and one was a matched unrelated donor. Donors received G-CSF 10-12 microg/kg/day for 3-7 days, and underwent one or two leukaphereses. The median cell yield per donor expressed per kg of recipient body weight was as follows: mononucleated cells 10.8 x 10(8)/kg (range 4.7-21.2); CD34+ cells 8.6 x 10(6)/kg (range 3.2-22); CD3+ cells 3.7 x 10(8)/kg (range 2.7-7.5). All patients achieved an ANC >0.5 x 10(9)/l after a median of 12 days (11-18). An unsupported platelet count >50 x 10(9)/l was reached 15 days (13-21) after PBPC transplantation; four patients failed to reach this threshold. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) grades II to IV occurred in eight (73%) patients: seven of them experienced grade III-IV aGVHD. Seven patients evaluable for chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were scored as absent in five, limited in one and extensive in one patient. As of September 1997, six patients (55 %) were alive between 60 and 938 days post-transplant (median follow-up 274 days); four patients with malignancy were alive in CR after primary allotransplantation, two patients were alive after a second PBPC transplant. Five patients have died with the main causes of death being aGVHD (n = 3), ARDS (n = 1), relapse of the underlying disease (n = 1). In conclusion, despite the limited number of patients, these preliminary results indicate that PBPC may be considered as an alternative to bone marrow for allografting also in children.","['Miniero, R', 'Busca, A', 'Bonetti, F', 'Giorgiani, G', 'Zecca, M', 'Berger, M', 'Incarbone, E', 'Vassallo, E', 'Perotti, C', 'Locatelli, F']","['Miniero R', 'Busca A', 'Bonetti F', 'Giorgiani G', 'Zecca M', 'Berger M', 'Incarbone E', 'Vassallo E', 'Perotti C', 'Locatelli F']","['Dipartimento di Immuno-Infettivologia e Onco-Ematologia, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/02/16 00:00,1999/02/16 00:01,['1999/02/16 00:00'],"['1999/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Dec;22 Suppl 5:S33-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prevent graft failure, large doses of T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cells were transplanted following a highly myeloablative and immunosuppressive conditioning regimen. Fifteen children with high-risk acute leukemia received T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cells from full-haplotype mismatched family members after a conditioning regimen that included single-dose TBI, thiotepa, ATG and fludarabine. To prevent GVHD, marrow cells were T-depleted by soybean agglutinin and E-rosetting, peripheral blood cells by E-rosetting followed by positive selection of the CD34+ cells. No post-transplant prophylaxis for GVHD was administered. In all patients full donor-type engraftment was achieved. None of the evaluable patients developed either acute or chronic GVHD. Regimen-related toxicity was minimal. Five patients are alive and event-free at a median follow-up of 18 months (range 13-28). All surviving patients have a good quality of life. Seven patients have relapsed. This study shows that GVHD and graft failure, which limited the use of full-haplotype mismatched bone marrow transplants, have been overcome.

The patients (three men, four women) were aged 37-86 years. They initially presented with cutaneous nodules or papules. Three cases presented with regional lymph nodes. Stagings were negative, except for one patient with bone marrow involvement. Histological features were relevant with pleomorphic medium T-cell lymphoma, but these cells exhibited a distinguishing phenotype. They were positive for CD4, CD56, and also CD45, CD43, and HLA-DR. All other T-cell and B-cell markers were negative. The myelomonocytic markers (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD117, myeloperoxidase, and lysozyme) were negative excepted CD68, which was clearly positive in four cases and weakly in two cases. Others natural killer cell markers (CD16, CD57, TiA1, granzyme B), TdT, and CD34 were negative. Polymerase chain reaction studies did not detect any B or T clonal rearrangement.

Five patients developed bone marrow involvement, with leukemia in three cases, and they died in 5-27 months. One patient died at 17 months with skin progression. The seventh patient is alive at 33 months, with cutaneous progression. The origin of these cells is unclear. Despite expression of CD4 or CD56, we failed to demonstrate a T-cell, natural killer cell origin. However, CD4 and CD56 are not specific for T or natural killer lineages.

Cell death is associated with activation of members of the interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) protease/caspase family and, is presumably prevented by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. To further address the role of Bcl-2 in GC-mediated cytotoxicity, we generated subclones of the GC-sensitive human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line CCRF-CEM, in which transgenic Bcl-2 expression is regulated by tetracycline. Up to about 48 h, exogenous Bcl-2 almost completely protected these cells from apoptosis, digestion of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and generation of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp cleaving (DEVDase) activity. However, when the cells were cultured for another 24 h in the continuous presence of GC, they underwent massive apoptosis that was associated with DEVDase activity and PARP cleavage. Bcl-2 did not markedly affect GC-mediated growth arrest, thereby separating the anti-proliferative from the apoptosis-inducing effect of GC. Moreover, Bcl-2 did not prevent the dramatic reduction in the levels of several mRNAs observed during GC treatment, including the transgenic Bcl-2 mRNA. Thus, Bcl-2 can be placed upstream of effector caspase activation, but downstream of other GC-regulated events, such as growth arrest and the potentially critical repression of steady state levels of multiple mRNA.","['Hartmann, B L', 'Geley, S', 'Loffler, M', 'Hattmannstorfer, R', 'Strasser-Wozak, E M', 'Auer, B', 'Kofler, R']","['Hartmann BL', 'Geley S', 'Loffler M', 'Hattmannstorfer R', 'Strasser-Wozak EM', 'Auer B', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/16 00:00,1999/02/16 00:01,['1999/02/16 00:00'],"['1999/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202339 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 21;18(3):713-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202339.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chimeric protein has been strongly implicated in APL pathogenesis because of its interactions with growth suppressors (PML), retinoid signaling molecules (RXRalpha), and nuclear hormone transcriptional co-repressors (N-CoR and SMRT). A small number of variant APL translocations have also been shown to involve rearrangements that fuse RARalpha to partner genes other than PML, namely PLZF, NPM, and NuMA. We describe the molecular characterization of a t(5;17)(q35;q21) variant translocation involving the NPM gene, identified in a pediatric case of APL. RT-PCR, cloning, and sequence studies identified NPM as the RARalpha partner on chromosome 5, and both NPM-RARalpha and RARalpha-NPM fusion mRNAs were expressed in this patient. We further explored the effects of the NPM-RARalpha chimeric protein on the subcellular localization of PML, RXRalpha, NPM, and PLZF using immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. While PML remained localized to its normal 10-20 nuclear bodies, NPM nucleolar localization was disrupted and PLZF expression was upregulated in a microspeckled pattern in patient leukemic bone marrow cells. We also observed nuclear co-localization of NPM, RXRalpha, and NPM-RARalpha in these cells. Our data support the hypothesis that while deregulation of both the retinoid signaling pathway and RARalpha partner proteins are molecular consequences of APL translocations, APL pathogenesis is not dependent on disruption of PML nuclear bodies.","['Hummel, J L', 'Wells, R A', 'Dube, I D', 'Licht, J D', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Hummel JL', 'Wells RA', 'Dube ID', 'Licht JD', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['University of Toronto and the Institute of Medical Sciences, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rara protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear phosphoprotein B2, rat)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleolus', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",,1999/02/16 00:00,1999/02/16 00:01,['1999/02/16 00:00'],"['1999/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202357 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 21;18(3):633-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202357.,['R01 CA 59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that automated RNA-based ddF (ARddF) has several advantages over conventional radioisotope-based ddF, including: (1) analysis of larger nucleic acid fragments (up to 10(3) bp), due to the ability to continuously analyse and compile sequencing information; (2) greater reliability for distinguishing mutant sequences from wild type sequences (particularly when the mutation leads to gain or loss of a dideoxy termination segment); (3) the use of fluorescent labeled primers, making ARddF less hazardous than methods requiring radionucleotides. The use of ARddF in conjunction with new methods for isolating RNA from a [corrected] small number of cells facilitates mutational analysis of small tissue biopsies and other limited samples, and will allow more widespread application of mutational screening in the setting of clinical diagnostic laboratories.","['Martincic, D', 'Koury, M J', 'Gale, K', 'Whitlock, J A']","['Martincic D', 'Koury MJ', 'Gale K', 'Whitlock JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Veterans Administration Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-6310, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Automation', 'Fluorescence', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/16 00:00,1999/02/16 00:01,['1999/02/16 00:00'],"['1999/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202295 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 21;18(3):617-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202295.,['1P30CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['Oncogene 1999 May 20;18(20):3186'],,,,,,,,

Competition experiments with a panel of specific antagonists indicated that the mAChR were predominantly of the M3 subtype. This was confirmed by the rt-PCR analysis of mRNA levels for M1-M5 AChR. Uninduced MELC expressed approximately 2,100 and 1,200 binding sites per cell of growing and resting populations, respectively. The dissociation constant (K(D)) for 3H-NMS was in the picomolar range. The modulation of mAChR upon induction suggested that MELC growth and maturation might be under control of a cholinergic system since mAChR were markedly decreased or virtually absent in MELC induced to terminal division by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), respectively. In turn, the number of mAChR on MELC committed to polyploidization by colcemid was either increased over or maintained at the control levels when receptor densities were expressed per cell or surface unit (square micrometers), respectively. Moreover, the muscarinic agonist carbachol was found to inhibit MELC differentiation by decreasing by approximately 35% the amount of benzidine-positive (B+) cells in HMBA-induced cultures and, to a lesser degree, also AChE levels. The carbachol effect on erythroid differentiation was reverted by atropine that was found to restore the original amount of B+ cells, while it reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to levels of approximately 66% of control. Such a selective atropine-mediated inhibition of AChE expression was observed also in HMBA-induced MELC supplemented with the antagonist. These results have suggested that mAChR on MELC are functional and might play a role in modulating the expression of either the erythroid or megakaryocytic traits of these cells.","['Cellai, C', 'Matucci, R', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Paoletti, F']","['Cellai C', 'Matucci R', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Paoletti F']","['Istituto di Patologia Generale, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6581-06-2 (Quinuclidinyl Benzilate)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'VDR09VTQ8U (N-Methylscopolamine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'N-Methylscopolamine/metabolism', 'Quinuclidinyl Benzilate/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/16 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/16 03:03'],"['1999/02/16 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/16 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199903)178:3<333::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199903)178:3<333::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-F [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 Mar;178(3):333-40. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199903)178:3<333::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-F.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purification steps included, in order, ammonium sulfate fractionation and eight stages of column chromatography on Macro-Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite, Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300 HR, Matrex PBA-30, CHT II, Resource-Q, anti-bovine serum albumin (BSA) agarose, and Superdex 200HR columns. The purified BAEGSF showed two bands with silver staining on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and their molecular weights were estimated as approximately 55 and 63 kDa, while the molecular weight of the purified BAEGSF was estimated as about 65 kDa by gel filtration using Superdex 200HR. This result shows that BAEGSF obtained from Superdex 200HR chromatography is a partially purified preparation and suggests that one of the two bands on SDS-PAGE corresponds to BAEGSF. BAEGSF was shown not to have a lethal effect on endothelial cells, but had an inhibitory action on the proliferation of these cells. Furthermore, the growth-suppressing activity of BAEGSF for bovine artery endothelial cells (BAE) was not inhibited by anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) antibodies.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in nine patients. In the United States, adoptive immunotherapy is currently being tested in eight patients with chemotherapy-resistant lymphoma. Autologous T cells were obtained prior to BMT and expanded using an anti-CD3/CD28 culture system. After BMT, the cells were reinfused into the patient.

It encodes a membrane protein related to Syg1p (suppressor of yeast G alpha deletion; ref. 8).

There was no correlation between the susceptibility to gemcitabine and the endogenous expression of the B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2)-family proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), BCL-2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) and BCL-XS. Ectopic expression of BCL-2 moderately attenuated gemcitabine-induced cell death. Similarly, preexposure to the synthetic steroid, dexamethasone, which is commonly used to control cerebral edema in brain tumor patients, reduced gemcitabine cytotoxicity. We conclude that the clinical evaluation of gemcitabine for the adjuvant chemotherapy of malignant glioma is warranted.","['Rieger, J', 'Durka, S', 'Streffer, J', 'Dichgans, J', 'Weller, M']","['Rieger J', 'Durka S', 'Streffer J', 'Dichgans J', 'Weller M']","['Department of Neurology, University of Tubingen, School of Medicine, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Genes, p53/physiology', 'Glioma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/13 00:00,1999/02/13 00:01,['1999/02/13 00:00'],"['1999/02/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(98)00883-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00883-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1999 Jan 22;365(2-3):301-8. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00883-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental measurements documented potential exposure to benzene. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using as references national (1949-1968) and regional mortality rates (1969-1991). Elevated mortality from lymphoma (seven deaths, SMR 190, 95% CI 76-391) and leukemia (eight deaths, SMR 225, 95% CI 97-443) was observed. No consistent trends by length of employment or time since first exposure were apparent. Nonetheless, the excess risk was particularly and significantly increased among workers with 15 or more years of employment, and 30 or more years since first employment. The findings of elevated mortality from leukemia and lymphoma are in agreement with those of other oil refinery studies. Chance, confounding, or other biases might have played a marginal, if any, role in determining the results.

KRN8602 was given at a dose of 12 or 15 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days, Ara-C at a dose of 100 mg/m2 for 7 consecutive days, VCR 1.4 mg/m2 (max. 2.0 mg/body) weekly for 4 weeks, and PSL 40 mg/m2 for principally 28 consecutive days. Of 14 patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia entered in the study, thirteen patients were evaluable for safety and 12 were evaluable for response. In AML, there was 1 partial response (PR) in 4 patients at a dose of 12 mg/m2. Against 1 complete response (CR) and 3 PRs in 4 patients at a dose of 15 mg/m2. In ALL, there was 1 PR in 1 case at a dose of 12 mg/m2, and 1 CR and 2 PR in 3 at a dose of 15 mg/m2. Major toxicities were nausea/vomiting and anorexia, but incidences and grades of toxicities were not dose-dependent, and all toxicities were tolerable and manageable.

Since in Japan, high-dose cytarabine for acute leukemia is not covered by health insurance, post-remission therapy might be less intense compared to western countries and it takes a long time to complete the therapy. The results of chemotherapy for adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in Japan have been inferior to those in foreign reports. Accordingly, many Japanese hematologists believe that adult ALL has a worse prognosis than acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and almost all young adult patients with ALL should receive allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from related or unrelated donors. Japanese hematologists also consider that Interferon as the first-line chemotherapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and that BMT from a HLA matched sibling donor should be done as soon as possible. Recently, some foreign reports of BMT from unrelated donors for CML revealed results comparable to BMT from related donors showing that even transplants from unrelated donors should be done as soon as possible. Since chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin's disease are so rare in Japan, the available drugs for these diseases are limited. The quality and quantity of Japanese clinical studies in this field are inferior to studies in western countries. This, in fact, is a more serious problem than the differences in therapeutic strategies.","['Sakamaki, H']",['Sakamaki H'],"['Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Importantly, type 1 responses have been associated with resistance to retroviral infection in mice, humans, and ruminants. Specifically, vaccination of sheep with vaccinia virus expressing bovine leukemia virus (BLV) gp51 resulted in protective immunity with the characteristics of a type 1 response, whereas vaccination of cattle resulted in a non-protective type 2 response. In order to test the hypothesis that cattle inoculated with BLV gp51 and IL12 will respond with a type 1 response, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing BLV gp51 together with bovine IL12 was developed and characterized in vitro. For induction of type 2 responses a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing gp51 with bovine IL4 was similarly constructed and characterized. In this study recombinant cassettes were developed containing either the BLVenv gene alone or in combination with bovine IL4 or the two genes, p35 and p40, encoding bovine IL12. Correct alignment with p7.5 or p11 vaccinia promoters and orientation was confirmed by complete sequencing. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by homologous recombination, selected based on large plaque formation due to reconstitution of the vp37 gene, and structurally confirmed by Southern blotting. Transcription of recombinant BLVenv, bovine IL4, p35 and p40 was demonstrated by RT-PCR. Expression of BLVenv gp51 protein and bovine IL4 was shown by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Biologically active bovine IL4 expressed by vaccinia virus stimulated lymphoblast proliferation, B lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of CD40L, and inhibited IFN gamma secretion from PHA activated PBMC in a dose dependent fashion. Finally, bovine IL12 expression and biological function was confirmed by dose dependent induction of IFN gamma secretion by PHA activated PBMC and the moderate enhancement of lymphoblast proliferation. In conclusion, bovine IL12 and IL4 expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus in vitro clearly exhibited type 1-type 2 modulating properties.","['Von Beust, B R', 'Brown, W C', 'Estes, D M', 'Zarlenga, D S', 'McElwain, T F', 'Palmer, G H']","['Von Beust BR', 'Brown WC', 'Estes DM', 'Zarlenga DS', 'McElwain TF', 'Palmer GH']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-7040, USA. bvbeust@vetmed.wsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,1999/02/13 00:00,1999/02/13 00:01,['1999/02/13 00:00'],"['1999/02/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(98)00208-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0264-410x(98)00208-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1999 Jan 28;17(4):384-95. doi: 10.1016/s0264-410x(98)00208-4.,['5-K11-AI01281/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a novel nested-PCR assay that detects DNA specific for clinically important strains of Trichosporon in serum samples from patients with disseminated trichosporonosis. In this assay, two sets of oligonucleotide primers were derived from the sequence of 26S rRNA genes of Trichosporon asahii. The specific fragment was amplified from T. asahii and T. mucoides, but not from other microorganisms, including some other basidiomycetous fungi (Cryptococcus, Malassezia, Rhodotorula, and Sporobolomyces). Target DNA was detected by the nested PCR with as little as 5 fg of the extracted DNA of T. asahii.

In a previous study, we have shown that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces a Tax-independent activation of the viral LTR expression. We have also noted that although most other TPA biological effects are attributed to its protein kinase C (PKC)-activating potential, this particular effect of TPA is PKC independent and antagonized by PKC activity. In addition, we have demonstrated that deletion of the ets-responsive region 1 (ERR-1) from the LTR abolishes its response to TPA. In the present study, we demonstrate that TPA exerts this effect by enhancing the binding of the Sp1 transcription factor to an Sp1-binding site located within ERR-1. This Sp1-binding stimulation was not diminished by a potent PKC-specific inhibitor like bisindolylmaleimide-I, indicating that it did not depend on PKC activity. However, no increase in Sp1 protein level could be detected in the TPA-treated cells, suggesting that TPA exerted its effect by a posttranslational modification of Sp1 protein rather than by stimulating its synthesis. Although the proximal Tax responsive 21-bp element also contains an Sp1-binding site, the present study shows that the modified Sp1 protein mediates the TPA effect on LTR only through the Sp1 site of the ERR-1.","['Torgeman, A', 'Mor-Vaknin, N', 'Aboud, M']","['Torgeman A', 'Mor-Vaknin N', 'Aboud M']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1999/02/13 00:00,1999/02/13 00:01,['1999/02/13 00:00'],"['1999/02/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99556-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9556 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Feb 15;254(2):279-87. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9556.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By cocultivating the donor cells with recipient cells transfected with a reporter plasmid possessing the luciferase gene under the T7 promoter, the expression of luciferase was observed upon cell fusion. The activation of the luciferase gene was inhibited by either anti-env neutralizing antibody or synthetic peptide corresponding to env gp21, thus indicating the cell fusion to be specifically mediated by the HTLV-I env glycoproteins expressed in the donor cells.

With an incidence estimated to be approximately 1 per 100,000 persons per year, MDS mainly affects the elderly. Myelodysplastic syndromes share many features with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia; in fact, a proportion of patients with MDS eventually develop acute myeloid leukemia. To illustrate a multimodal approach in the diagnosis of patients with hematopoietic disorders, we describe a 66-year-old patient with a question of myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and two translocations involving chromosome 10:t(5;10) and t(7;10). These structural rearrangements effectively gave rise to monosomy for part of the long arm of chromosome 5 and for the long arm of chromosome 7. Findings of del(5q) and del(7) in MDS have been reported in the literature. The results of chromosome morphometry, which was conducted to compare the lengths of all relevant chromosome segments, are consistent with the hypothesized chromosomal abnormalities. The investigational technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using both painting and alpha-satellite probes, was used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetics to further delineate the nature of the chromosome abnormalities observed in the GTG-banded studies. Confirmatory studies utilizing the new technique of spectral karyotyping (SKY) were also carried out. Thus, the multimodal approach of hematopathology, GTG-banding, chromosome morphometry, FISH, and SKY can be very useful for delineating complex cytogenetic cases.","['Mark, H F', 'Gray, Y', 'Mark, Y', 'Khorsand, J', 'Sikov, W']","['Mark HF', 'Gray Y', 'Mark Y', 'Khorsand J', 'Sikov W']","['Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Pawtucket, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/pathology']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898001423 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00142-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Feb;109(1):14-20. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00142-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its significance in other cancers, however, has not been extensively investigated until recently. Less than 20 cases of polysomy for chromosome 12 have been studied thus far. The most recent data in the literature suggest that gain of chromosome 12 may be a recurrent and sometimes early event in breast carcinogenesis. To test the hypothesis that a subset of breast cancer may be characterized by chromosome 12 trisomy, we conducted a retrospective study of 40 specimens. Of these, ten were stage I, ten were stage II, ten were stage III, and ten were stage IV. Out of the total sample, 12 cases (30%) were found to be presumably trisomic, if a conservative cutoff point of greater than or equal to 15% cells with three signals is adopted. Furthermore, some, but not all, of the 12 cases were found to be likely triploid, when data from a control chromosome 17 probe were taken into account. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that a subset of breast cancer exists which is characterized by an abnormal copy of chromosome 12, in either a diploid or a triploid background.","['Mark, H F', 'Brown, S', 'Taylor, W', 'Bassily, N', 'Sun, C L', 'Samy, M', 'Bland, K I']","['Mark HF', 'Brown S', 'Taylor W', 'Bassily N', 'Sun CL', 'Samy M', 'Bland KI']","['Lifespan Academic Medical Center Cytogenetics Laboratory, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence 02903, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Trisomy']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898001046 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00104-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Jan 1;108(1):26-31. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00104-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome was identified in every case studied. Only 5 among 20 CP patients had additional abnormalities while 13 of 18 patients with disease progression (BC + AP) showed extra numerical and/or structural chromosomal aberrations. Cytogenetically, the most common chromosome gains during BC and AP were double or triple Ph chromosomes (5 of 14 cases) and trisomy 8 (5 of 14 cases). Trisomies 7 and 17 (1 of 14 cases each) were also observed. CGH analysis detected genetic imbalances in eight cases. Gains of chromosome 20 (3 cases) and 17q (2 cases) were observed, respectively. The recurrent chromosome loss was the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17, seen in one case with i(17)(q10) and one case with an unbalanced translocation (1;17). In one case, a very complex chromosomal rearrangement, del(3),del(6),der(6)t(17;3;6),der(17)t(6;17), was seen. A novel finding of this work is the involvement of chromosome 1(q12-21qter) in CML disease progression. Overrepresentation of 1(q12-21qter) region was detected by CGH in one case which had a derivative chromosome 17. This abnormal chromosome was later confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) painting to be a fusion between chromosome 1 and 17 to form the der(17)t(1;17) (q12-21;p11). Two other cases showed the same region being involved in translocations, t(1;10)(q12-21;q26) and t(1;11)(q12-21;p15). It is possible that one or more genes residing on chromosome 1q12-21 may be important in the acute transformation of CML. In conclusion, we find that the combined use of CGH, chromosome painting, and classic cytogenetic analysis allows a better evaluation of the genomic aberration involved in CML blastic transformation, and offers new directions for its further molecular investigations.","['Su, X Y', 'Wong, N', 'Cao, Q', 'Yu, L Z', 'Niu, C', 'Wickham, N', 'Johnson, P J', 'Chen, Z', 'Chen, S J']","['Su XY', 'Wong N', 'Cao Q', 'Yu LZ', 'Niu C', 'Wickham N', 'Johnson PJ', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",,1999/02/12 00:00,1999/02/12 00:01,['1999/02/12 00:00'],"['1999/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898001204 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00120-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Jan 1;108(1):6-12. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00120-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble zymosan polysaccharide (SZP) or pure beta-glucans labeled with FITC or 125I bound in a saturable and reversible manner to neutrophils, macrophages, and NK cells. This lectin activity was blocked by anti-CD11b mAb M1/70 or 5C6 and did not occur with leukocytes from CR3-/- (CD11b-deficient) mice. SZP preparations containing primarily mannose or glucose bound to CR3, and the binding of 125I-labeled beta-glucan to CR3 was competitively inhibited by beta-glucans from barley or seaweed, but not by yeast alpha-mannan. Also, as with human CR3, the lectin site of mouse CR3 was inhibited by alpha- or beta-methylglucoside (but not D-glucose), alpha- or beta-methylmannoside, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Phagocytosis of zymosan and serum-opsonized zymosan was partially inhibited by anti-CR3 and was reduced to <40% of normal with leukocytes from CR3-/- mice. As with neutrophils from patients with CD18 deficiency, neutrophils from CR3-/- mice exhibited no phagocytosis of particulate beta-glucan. SZP or beta-glucans primed CR3 of neutrophils, macrophages, and NK cells for cytotoxicity of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells that otherwise did not trigger killing. beta-Glucan priming for cytotoxicity was inhibited by anti-CR3 and did not occur with leukocytes from CR3-/- mice. The primed state of macrophage and NK cell CR3 remained detectable for 18 to 24 h after pulsing with beta-glucans.

Inhibitors that disrupt microfilaments, such as latrunculin and cytochalasin D, do not cause any degranulation on their own, but they do enhance FcepsilonRI-mediated degranulation. Dose-response studies show a good correlation between inhibition of actin polymerization and increased degranulation. In RBL cells, latrunculin causes a decrease in basal levels of filamentous actin (F-actin), while cytochalasin D does not. This is particularly evident in the Triton-insoluble pool of F-actin which is highly cross-linked and associated with the plasma membrane. A concentration of 500 nM latrunculin decreases the basal level of Triton-insoluble F-actin by 60-70% and total F-actin levels by 25%. Latrunculin increases both the rate and extent of Ag-induced degranulation while having no effect on pervanadate-induced degranulation. Pervanadate activates the signaling pathways directly and bypasses the cross-linking of the receptor. RBL cells, activated through FcepsilonRI in the presence of latrunculin, show increased phospholipase activity as well as increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor itself by the tyrosine kinase Lyn. This indicates that the very earliest signaling events after receptor cross-linking are enhanced. These results suggest that actin microfilaments may interact, either directly or indirectly, with the receptor itself and that they may regulate the signaling process at the level of receptor phosphorylation. Microfilaments may possibly act by uncoupling Lyn from the cross-linked receptor.","['Frigeri, L', 'Apgar, J R']","['Frigeri L', 'Apgar JR']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'LW7U308U7U (latrunculin B)', 'SRQ9WWM084 (latrunculin A)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*physiology', 'Actins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Haptens/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Marine Toxins/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Porifera', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Feb 15;162(4):2243-50.,"['R0 1GM42388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI42244/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite different hypotheses, the brain localization of these B cell lymphomas remains an enigma. To better define the cell origin of the lymphomas and the possible role of the B cell receptor (BCR) in the brain localization and/or in the oncogenic transformation, we analyzed the V region genes of the Ig heavy chain expressed by lymphoma cells in five randomly selected patients. After amplifying the rearranged VHDJH DNA by PCR, cloning, and sequencing of the amplified products, we observed that: 1) of the five lymphomas analyzed, four were clearly monoclonal; 2) there was no preferential use of one peculiar VH family or one peculiar segment of gene; 3) the mutation analysis showed that an Ag-driven process occurred in at least two cases, probably before the oncogenic event; and 4) there was no intraclonal variability, suggesting that the hypermutation mechanism is no longer efficient in these lymphoma B cells. Taken together, our results suggest that distinct Ags could be recognized by the BCR of the lymphoma cells in different patients and that, if the Ags are responsible for the brain localization of these B cells bearing mutated BCR, other factors must be involved in B cell transformations in primary central nervous system lymphoma.","['Julien, S', 'Radosavljevic, M', 'Labouret, N', 'Camilleri-Broet, S', 'Davi, F', 'Raphael, M', 'Martin, T', 'Pasquali, J L']","['Julien S', 'Radosavljevic M', 'Labouret N', 'Camilleri-Broet S', 'Davi F', 'Raphael M', 'Martin T', 'Pasquali JL']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunopathologie, Centre de Recherche d'Immunohematologie, Hopital Civil, Hopitaux Universitaires, Strasbourg, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/etiology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Feb 1;162(3):1551-8.,,,"['GENBANK/AF111188', 'GENBANK/AF111189', 'GENBANK/AF111190', 'GENBANK/AF111191', 'GENBANK/AF111192']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glycoprotein 130 (gp130) belongs to the family of class I cytokine receptors and is the common signal-transducing receptor subunit shared by the so-called IL-6 type cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1). The inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-11 induce gp130 homodimerization after binding to their specific alpha receptors, which leads to the activation of the Janus kinase/STAT signal transduction pathway. A molecular model of IL-6/IL-6R/gp130, which is based on the structure of the growth hormone/growth hormone receptor complex, allowed the selection of several amino acids located in the cytokine-binding module of gp130 for mutagenesis. The mutants were analyzed with regard to IL-6- or IL-11-induced STAT activation and ligand binding. It was found that Y190 and F191 are essential for the interaction of gp130 with IL-6 as well as IL-11, suggesting a common mode of recognition of helical cytokines by class I cytokine receptors. Furthermore, the requirement of the gp130 N-terminal Ig-like domain for ligand binding and signal transduction was demonstrated by the use of deletion mutants. Thus, besides the observed analogy to the growth hormone/growth hormone receptor complex, there is a substantial difference in the mechanism of receptor engagement by cytokines that signal via gp130.","['Kurth, I', 'Horsten, U', 'Pflanz, S', 'Dahmen, H', 'Kuster, A', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Muller-Newen, G']","['Kurth I', 'Horsten U', 'Pflanz S', 'Dahmen H', 'Kuster A', 'Grotzinger J', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Epitopes/chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Interleukin-6/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Interleukin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/chemistry/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Feb 1;162(3):1480-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, signal transduction to the human IL-2 gene became disrupted. Heterokaryons formed by the fusion of anergic murine T cells to normal murine T cells also failed to accumulate intracellular IL-2 protein in response to stimulation either with the combination of CD3 and CD28 mAbs or with ionomycin plus a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester.

Hsp70 was associated with only final sized octamer, while hsp90 was found to associate with the octamer and two distinct precursor peptides. The gp96 was associated with the octamer and one of the two precursors. Thus, each of the hsps bound a distinct set of peptides.

The importance of angiogenic factors such as VEGF, although clearly established in solid tumors, has not been fully elucidated in human hematopoietic neoplasms. We examined the expression of mRNA and protein for VEGF in 12 human hematopoietic tumor cell lines, representing multiple lineages and diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Our results revealed that VEGF message was expressed in these cells and that the corresponding protein was secreted into the extracellular environment. Five of the 12 cell lines were also found to express the Flt-1 receptor for VEGF at a moderate to strong level, suggesting an autocrine pathway. When human vascular endothelial cells were exposed to recombinant human VEGF, there was an increase in the mRNA for several hematopoietic growth factors including macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 6. Plasma cells in the bone marrow from patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma were found to express VEGF, whereas both the Flt-1 and KDR high affinity VEGF receptors were observed to be markedly elevated in the normal bone marrow myeloid and monocytic cells surrounding the tumor. These data raise the possibility that VEGF may play a role in the growth of hematopoietic neoplasms such as multiple myeloma through either a paracrine or an autocrine mechanism.","['Bellamy, W T', 'Richter, L', 'Frutiger, Y', 'Grogan, T M']","['Bellamy WT', 'Richter L', 'Frutiger Y', 'Grogan TM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA. wbellamy@u.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,1999/02/11 03:18,2000/04/29 09:00,['1999/02/11 03:18'],"['1999/02/11 03:18 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/11 03:18 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Feb 1;59(3):728-33.,"['CA-32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ESO6694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Routine necropsies were performed on 51 koalas with suspected lymphoid neoplasia between 1986 and 1997 in New South Wales and Queensland. Immunophenotyping was by an immunoperoxidase method utilising species cross-reactive antibodies raised against human lymphocytes and an antibody raised against koala IgG. Cases were classified according to organs and tissues affected and the morphological features of neoplastic cells. RESULTS: Twenty-six (51%) of the cases were of the T cell immunophenotype, 12 (24%) were of B cell immunophenotype and 13 (25%) did not stain. The age and sex of koalas did not correlate with immunophenotype (P = 0.686 and P = 1.000, respectively). Thirty-two cases were leukaemic and 36 had multiple organ involvement, probably reflecting presentation of koalas at advanced stages of disease. Abdominal tissue involvement was most common (44 cases), followed by nodal (32), atypical (21) and cervicomediastinal (14). The T cell immunophenotype was over-represented among the leukaemic cases (P = 0.013). Generally, the T cell immunophenotype predominated except for many affected atypical tissues. Neoplastic cells were mostly of medium nuclear size with round to oval nuclei. No correlations were found for cell morphology, mitotic index and immunophenotype. CONCLUSION: The prognostic value of an immunophenotypic, anatomical and morphological basis for the classification of lymphoid neoplasia in the koala currently is limited by the need to detect these neoplasms at an early age, the requirement for freshly fixed tissues and the restricted range of available cross-reacting antibodies.","['Connolly, J H', 'Canfield, P J', 'Hemsley, S', 'Spencer, A J']","['Connolly JH', 'Canfield PJ', 'Hemsley S', 'Spencer AJ']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Pathology, University of Sydney, New South Wales.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/veterinary', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/veterinary', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/pathology/veterinary', 'Male', '*Marsupialia', 'Neoplasms/classification/pathology/*veterinary', 'Salivary Glands/immunology/pathology', 'Sex Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/pathology']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-0813.1998.tb12337.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 1998 Dec;76(12):819-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.1998.tb12337.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This attenuation of leukemogenesis correlated with an inability of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV to establish infection in the bone marrow of mice at early times postinfection. These results suggested that a cell type(s) is infected in the skin by wild-type but not Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV after s.c. inoculation and that this infection is important for the delivery of infection to the bone marrow, as well as for efficient leukemogenesis. To determine the nature of the cell types infected by M-MuLV and Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV in the skin after a s.c. inoculation, immunohistochemistry with an anti-M-MuLV CA antibody was performed. Cells of developing hair follicles, specifically cells of the outer root sheath (ORS), were extensively infected by M-MuLV after s.c. inoculation. The Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV variant also infected cells of the ORS but the level of infection was lower. By Western blot analysis, the level of infection in skin by Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV was approximately 4- to 10-fold less than that of wild-type M-MuLV. Similar results were seen when a mouse keratinocyte line was infected in vitro with both viruses. Cells of the ORS are a primary target of infection in vivo, since a replication defective M-MuLV-based vector expressing beta-galactosidase also infected these cells after a s.c. inoculation.","['Okimoto, M A', 'Fan, H']","['Okimoto MA', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Hair Follicle/*virology', 'Keratinocytes/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Skin/virology']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.2509-2516.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):2509-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.2509-2516.1999.,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 AI07319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC104498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite these data, it remains unclear how often interspecies transmission events occur or whether their frequency is influenced by the evolutionary distance between host taxa. To address this problem we used PCR to amplify and characterize endogenous retroviruses related to the murine leukemia viruses. We show that members of this retroviral genus are harbored by considerably more organisms than previously thought and that phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that viruses isolated from a particular host class generally cluster together, suggesting that infectious virus horizontal transfer between vertebrate classes occurs only rarely. However, two recent instances of transmission of zoonotic infections between distantly related host organisms were identified. One, from mammals to birds, has led to a rapid adaptive radiation into other avian hosts. The other, between placental and marsupial mammals, involves viruses clustering with recently described porcine retroviruses, adding to concerns regarding the xenotransplantation of pig organs to humans.","['Martin, J', 'Herniou, E', 'Cook, J', ""O'Neill, R W"", 'Tristem, M']","['Martin J', 'Herniou E', 'Cook J', ""O'Neill RW"", 'Tristem M']","['Department of Biology, Imperial College, Ascot, Berkshire SL5 7PY, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*transmission']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.2442-2449.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):2442-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.2442-2449.1999.,,PMC104491,"['GENBANK/AJ236109', 'GENBANK/AJ236110', 'GENBANK/AJ236111', 'GENBANK/AJ236112', 'GENBANK/AJ236113', 'GENBANK/AJ236114', 'GENBANK/AJ236115', 'GENBANK/AJ236116', 'GENBANK/AJ236117', 'GENBANK/AJ236118', 'GENBANK/AJ236119', 'GENBANK/AJ236120', 'GENBANK/AJ236121', 'GENBANK/AJ236122', 'GENBANK/AJ236123', 'GENBANK/AJ236124', 'GENBANK/AJ236125', 'GENBANK/AJ236126', 'GENBANK/AJ236127', 'GENBANK/AJ236128', 'GENBANK/AJ236129', 'GENBANK/AJ236130', 'GENBANK/AJ236131', 'GENBANK/AJ236132', 'GENBANK/AJ236133', 'GENBANK/AJ236134']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the preleukemic period (4 to 10 weeks postinoculation) a marked decrease in thymic size is apparent for M-MuLV-inoculated mice in comparison to age-matched uninoculated mice. We were interested in studying whether the thymic regression was due to an increased rate of thymocyte apoptosis in the thymi of M-MuLV-inoculated mice. Neonatal NIH/Swiss mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with wild-type M-MuLV (approximately 10(5) XC PFU). Mice were sacrificed at 4 to 11 weeks postinoculation. Thymic single-cell suspensions were prepared and tested for apoptosis by two-parameter flow cytometry. Indications of apoptosis included changes in cell size and staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D or annexin V. The levels of thymocyte apoptosis were significantly higher in M-MuLV-inoculated mice than in uninoculated control animals, and the levels of apoptosis were correlated with thymic atrophy. To test the relevance of enhanced thymocyte apoptosis to leukemogenesis, mice were inoculated with the Mo+PyF101 enhancer variant of M-MuLV. When inoculated intraperitoneally, a route that results in wild-type M-MuLV leukemogenesis, mice displayed levels of enhanced thymocyte apoptosis comparable to those seen with wild-type M-MuLV. However, in mice inoculated s.c., a route that results in attenuated leukemogenesis, significantly lower levels of apoptosis were observed. This supported a role for higher levels of thymocyte apoptosis in M-MuLV leukemogenesis. To examine the possible role of mink cell focus-forming (MCF) recombinant virus in raising levels of thymocyte apoptosis, MCF-specific focal immunofluorescence assays were performed on thymocytes from preleukemic mice inoculated with M-MuLV and Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV. The results indicated that infection of thymocytes by MCF virus recombinants is not required for the increased level of apoptosis and thymic atrophy.","['Bonzon, C', 'Fan, H']","['Bonzon C', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Atrophy', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/physiology', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Preleukemia/*pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.2434-2441.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):2434-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.2434-2441.1999.,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32-CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC104490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intramuscular DNA vaccination induced CTL against both Gag and Env proteins. A detailed analysis of epitopes recognized by CTL generated in mice inoculated with the whole virus and with the Gag-expressing plasmid confirmed the presence of an immunodominant peptide in the leader sequence of Gag protein (Gag85-93, CCLCLTVFL) that is identical to that described in B6 mice immunized with Friend MuLV-induced leukemia cells. Moreover, CTL generated by immunization with the Env-encoding plasmid recognized a subdominant Env peptide (Env189-196, SSWDFITV), originally described in the B6.CH-2(bm13) mutant strain. B6 mice immunized with the Gag-expressing plasmid were fully protected against a lethal tumor challenge with M-MuLV-transformed MBL-2 leukemia cells, while vaccination with the Env-expressing plasmid resulted in rejection of the tumor in 44% of the mice and in increased survival of an additional 17% of the animals.

The E4orf6 protein binds and relocalizes E1B-55-kDa, and the proteins act synergistically to inactivate p53. We show that another adenovirus E4 gene product, E4orf3, is also sufficient to relocalize E1B-55-kDa from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Both proteins are then found in discrete nuclear structures (tracks) that are known to contain components of the promyelocytic leukemia-associated nuclear structure. Simultaneously, p53 is dissociated from E1B-55-kDa and is found evenly distributed over the nucleoplasm. In the presence of E4orf3, p53-dependent transcriptional activity is no longer repressed by E1B-55-kDa. When E1B-55-kDa is coexpressed with E4orf3 and E4orf6, E1B-55-kDa is found to colocalize with E4orf6 rather than E4orf3. In parallel, p53 is inhibited and degraded by the combination of E1B-55-kDa and E4orf6, regardless of coexpressed E4orf3. This suggests that the effects of E4orf6 on E1B-55-kDa overrule the actions of E4orf3. When cells are infected with virus expressing E4orf3 but not E4orf6, E1B is found in the cell nucleus and p53 enters the virus replication centers. After infection with wild-type adenovirus, E4orf3 is expressed before E4orf6 and E1B temporarily colocalizes with E4orf3 in nuclear tracks before associating with E4orf6. We propose that during adenovirus infection, the E4orf3 protein transiently liberates p53 from its association with E1B-55-kDa. Subsequently, p53 is inactivated and degraded by the combination of E1B-55-kDa and E4orf6.","['Konig, C', 'Roth, J', 'Dobbelstein, M']","['Konig C', 'Roth J', 'Dobbelstein M']","['Institut fur Virologie, Zentrum fur Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Philipps-Universitat Marburg, 35037 Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1B Proteins/*physiology', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'Molecular Weight', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Virus Replication']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.2253-2262.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):2253-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.2253-2262.1999.,,PMC104470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when the N-terminal membrane-binding domain of each molecule was replaced with that of the Src oncoprotein, which is also targeted to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, efficient copackaging was observed in genetic complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays.

One mechanism by which c-myb can be activated is through the integration of a retroviral provirus into the central portion of the locus, causing premature termination of c-myb transcription and translation. We had previously shown that a leukemia-specific c-Myb protein, truncated at the site of proviral integration by 248 amino acids, had approximately a fourfold-increased half-life compared to the normal c-Myb protein, due to its ability to escape rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. Here we provide evidence for the existence of more than one instability determinant in the carboxy-terminal region of the wild-type protein, which appear to act independently of each other. The data were derived from examination of premature termination mutants and deletion mutants of the normal protein, as well as analysis of another carboxy-terminally truncated protein expressed in leukemia. Evidence is provided that one instability determinant is located in the terminal 87 amino acids of the protein and another is located in the vicinity of the internal region that has leucine zipper homology. In leukemias, different degrees of protein stability are attained following proviral integration depending upon how many determinants are removed. Interestingly, although PEST sequences (rich in proline, glutamine, serine, and threonine), often associated with degradation, are found in c-Myb, deletion of PEST-containing regions had no effect on protein turnover. This study provides further insight into how inappropriate expression of c-Myb may contribute to leukemogenesis. In addition, it will facilitate further studies aimed at characterizing the specific role of individual regions of the normal protein in targeting to the 26S proteasome.","['Bies, J', 'Nazarov, V', 'Wolff, L']","['Bies J', 'Nazarov V', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Integration']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.2038-2044.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):2038-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.2038-2044.1999.,,PMC104446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, particle release, although required, is not sufficient for the cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1, and the basic residues of the matrix protein are involved in steps that occur after viral particle release.","['Le Blanc, I', 'Rosenberg, A R', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Le Blanc I', 'Rosenberg AR', 'Dokhelar MC']","['INSERM U332, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Virion/physiology', 'Virus Replication']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.1860-1867.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):1860-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.1860-1867.1999.,,PMC104426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The N terminus of IN contains an HHCC zinc finger-like motif, which is conserved among all retroviruses. To study the function of the HHCC domain of Moloney murine leukemia virus IN, the first N-terminal 105 residues were expressed independently. This HHCC domain protein is found to complement a completely nonoverlapping construct lacking the HHCC domain for strand transfer, 3' processing and coordinated disintegration reactions, revealing trans interactions among IN domains. The HHCC domain protein binds zinc at a 1:1 ratio and changes its conformation upon binding to zinc. The presence of zinc within the HHCC domain stimulates selective integration processes. Zinc promotes the dimerization of the HHCC domain and protects it from N-ethylmaleimide modification.

Viruses in which either the N-terminal 30 amino acids or the C-terminal 22 amino acids of this region were replaced by the 7-amino-acid sequence ASAVAGA were fully infectious. Insertions of this 7-amino-acid sequence at the N terminus, center, and the C terminus of the hypervariable domain had little effect on envelope protein (Env) function, while this insertion at a position 10 amino acids following the N terminus partially destabilized the association between the SU and transmembrane subunits of Env. Large, complex domains (either a 252-amino-acid single-chain antibody binding domain [scFv] or a 96-amino-acid V1/V2 domain of HIV-1 SU containing eight N-linked glycosylation sites and two disulfides) did not interfere with Env function when inserted in the center or C-terminal portions of the hypervariable domain. The scFv domain inserted into the C-terminal region of the hypervariable domain was shown to mediate binding of antigen to viral particles, demonstrating that it folded into the active conformation and was displayed on the surface of the virion. Both positive and negative enrichment of virions expressing the V1/V2 sequence were achieved by using a monoclonal antibody specific for a conformational epitope presented by the inserted sequence. These results indicated that the hypervariable domain of Friend ecotropic SU does not contain any specific sequence or structure that is essential for Env function and demonstrated that insertions into this domain can be used to extend particle display methodologies to complex protein domains that require expression in eukaryotic cells for glycosylation and proper folding.","['Kayman, S C', 'Park, H', 'Saxon, M', 'Pinter, A']","['Kayman SC', 'Park H', 'Saxon M', 'Pinter A']","['Laboratory of Retroviral Biology, Public Health Research Institute, New York, New York 10016, USA. skayman@phr.nyu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/genetics', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Virion/*genetics']",,1999/02/11 00:00,1999/02/11 00:01,['1999/02/11 00:00'],"['1999/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.3.1802-1808.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Mar;73(3):1802-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.3.1802-1808.1999.,"['P30 AI027742/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI-27742/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI34217/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC104419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of EBV in the CAEBV is not well clarified. A retrospective study was performed on nine adult and five child patients (eight males and six females). Histologically, at first admission, the presence of neoplastic lesions could not be confirmed. The lymph nodes in half of all cases revealed paracortical hyperplasia with transformed lymphocytes (hyperplastic type). Half of the cases showed non-suppurative necrosis and an increased number of histiocytes with phagocytosis (histiocytic type). Activated histiocytes with lymphokine positivity were frequently detected in the histiocytic type. In the phenotypical study, 10 of the examined 11 cases showed increased numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and/or CD8-positive T lymphocytes. In situ hybridization (ISH) showed EBV-infected lymphoid cells, but the number of EBV-infected cells varied. Double-labeling immunochemistry/ISH demonstrated EBV-infected T cells, including NK cells, but not B cells. In addition, three cases showed a monoclonal dissemination of EBV terminal repetitive sequence (TR), and two cases showed oligoclonal dissemination. From those findings, monoclonal, oligoclonal and polyclonal populations of EBV-infected T or NK cells were considered to be present in CAEBV states. During the clinical course, 12 of the 14 cases died within 5 years. Six cases died from EBV-associated hematopoietic tumors (histiocytic tumor, T cell lymphoma, B cell lymphoma, plasmacytoma, and NK cell leukemia); one from non-EBV-associated acute myelogenous leukemia, and five due to hemophagocytic syndrome. The examined EBV-associated hematopoietic tumors showed monoclonal EBV terminal repetitive sequences. There is a possibility that the monoclonal dissemination of EBV-infected cells develops from oligoclonal or polyclonal EBV-infected cells. And active histiocytes with lymphokine positivity were frequently detected in the cases with histologically histiocytic type.

We investigated the role of retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) in the combined effects of retinoids and VD3 on growth inhibition and differentiation induction in human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells by using RAR- or RXR-selective retinoids. An isobologram analysis showed that both combinations were synergistic with regard to inhibiting the proliferation, and RAR agonists exhibited greater synergism with VD3 than did RXR agonists. RXR agonists alone induced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and expression of CD11b in U937 cells, whereas RAR agonists alone did not. On the other hand, RAR agonists and RXR agonists enhanced the differentiation induced by VD3, but RXR agonists required higher concentrations. An RAR antagonist inhibited the differentiation induced by RAR agonists plus VD3, but not that induced by RXR agonists plus VD3. Thus, RARs and RXRs act differently in their synergism with VD3. RAR agonists are more potent than RXR agonists with regard to synergism with VD3, and their combination may be useful in differentiation therapy against myeloid leukemia.","['Makishima, M', 'Shudo, K', 'Honma, Y']","['Makishima M', 'Shudo K', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*agonists', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/02/10 00:00,1999/02/10 00:01,['1999/02/10 00:00'],"['1999/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00329-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00329-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Mar 1;57(5):521-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00329-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From previous studies, it appeared that inhibition of the influx of extracellular calcium is the major cause of this inhibition of exocytosis. Here, we explored the role of drug-membrane interactions in the inhibition of mediator release. We investigated the effects on phase transition and fluidity of artificial membranes. All compounds studied distorted the phase transition in L-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes, which correlated with the drug-induced increase in membrane fluidity measured by fluorescence anisotropy of the bilayer interacting probe 1-[4-(trimethylamino)-phenyl]-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene. Erythrocytes were used to study membrane effects on a cellular level. The hypotonic-induced haemolysis of erythrocytes was inhibited by the drugs. Compounds which increased membrane fluidity of liposomes to a greater extent were also more active in decreasing haemolysis. Drug-induced disturbance of the membranes is related to their effect on the activity of store-operated Ca2+ channels.

The presence of cell membrane gp80 and gp130 IL-6 receptors was studied in 98 patients with various leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma using flow cytofluorometry and immunohistology. Except neoplasia of immature B cells which expressed neither of the receptors, the majority of B cell tumours expressed one or both of them, mantle cell lymphoma being found to express the highest density of receptors. Using IL-6-dependent XG myeloma cell lines and mAb recognizing various gp80 and gp130 functional epitopes, it has been shown that IL-6 activation leads to a modified expression of some epitopes. In particular, the decrease or the disappearance of a gp130 epitope called A1 signed gp130 dimerization which is the first step of the gp130 activation pathway. Gp80 and gp130 epitope analysis was achieved in 17 of the patients. In four, an epitope phenotype compatible with a cytokine-induced activation was found. The cells of five B-CLL patients which expressed both gp80 and gp130 receptors were incubated with IL-6 to induce activation. In three of the cases they were found to rearrange their receptors in activated forms but not in the two others, showing that cells able to be activated or not can be found.

Four (11%) patients died secondarily to intracerebral hemorrhage (IH) and two (5.4%) dropped out of the protocol due to severe ATRA side effects (one RAS and one hepatotoxicity).

However, there are few reports on the treatment outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) among the Chinese population. PROCEDURE: Sixty-five children with ALL were treated with a modified protocol of the Medical Research Council United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia protocol X(MRC UKALL X) at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Most patients were ethnic Chinese. They were divided into groups A and B, depending on whether their presenting leucocyte count being was less or greater than 50 x 10(9)/l, respectively. Group A patients of received induction, early intensification (week 5), cranial irradiation, and maintenance for 3 years. Group B patients received an additional late intensification (week 20). RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 6.8 years(range: 3.4-10.1 years). The event-free and overall survival rates of all patients at 7 years were 66% (confidence interval [CI] 53-76) and 75% (CI 63-84), respectively. The event-free survival rates of groups A and B at 7 years were 67% (CI 52-79) and 60% (CI 32-80), respectively (P= 0.39). The overall survival rates of groups A and B at 7 years were 80% (CI 66-89) and 60% (CI 32-80), respectively (P = 0.07). With this treatment protocol, the factors which adversely affected the outcome were age (<2 years and >10 years) and T-cell subtype. Sex, white blood count at diagnosis, and FAB subtypes were not statistically significant prognostic factors.

Granulocytes and monocytes function as members of the immune system. Surface antigens serve as biological sensors allowing various cells to interact with different stimuli. Abnormalities of surface antigens may be associated with defective cell function and may indicate a more severe or more advanced stage of the disease. INFORMATION SOURCES: The author has a great interest in bone marrow changes in MDS and has several previous publications in this field. In addition, relevant articles published since 1966 were retrieved using Medline of English literature and were included. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: Several surface antigens in MDS have shown abnormal expression either in the intensity of fluorescence or the percentage of positive cells. These abnormalities include increased, decreased or lineage-aberrant expression. Abnormalities of several surface markers have prognostic significance. MDS patients with a low percentage of bone marrow cells expressing CD11b had a higher risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia and shorter survival compared to patients with more than 53% of marrow cells expressing CD11b (29 weeks versus 160 weeks). On the other hand, an increased percentage of bone marrow cells expressing early or immature markers, such as CD 13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR, has been associated with a worse outcome and with progression to a higher risk MDS or to acute myeloid leukemia. However, there are numerous discrepancies and inconsistencies in the literature when reviewing surface marker changes in MDS. These discrepancies may be related, at least in part, to the presence of an intracellular storage compartment of numerous surface antigens in the granulocytes and monocytes. Because of these storage pools, the techniques of preparing more mature granulocytes and monocytes, such as density gradient separation, and the interpretation of results must be carefully evaluated. Furthermore, various methods have been used to express abnormal results including percentage of positive or negative cells, fluorescent intensity (FI) of individual patients or a group of patients using a mean fluorescent channel (256 or 1024 channel mode), and finally the expression of FI as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes or antibody binding capacities. Several mechanisms may be involved in the abnormal expression of surface antigens in MDS including defective granulopoiesis, defective intracellular storage pool, abnormal membrane of cytoplasmic granules, and the effect of high levels of marrow cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor-beta. Standardization of the methods of preparing and studying mature and maturing granulocytes and monocytes in MDS has to be achieved in order to produce comparable results, thus allowing surface marker studies to be utilized as diagnostic and prognostic tools in MDS.","['Elghetany, M T']",['Elghetany MT'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0743, USA. m.tarek.elghetany@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Biomarkers', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/pathology']",105,1999/02/09 00:00,1999/02/09 00:01,['1999/02/09 00:00'],"['1999/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Dec;83(12):1104-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteoglycan CD44 is an adhesion molecule that may be expressed as a standard form of 85-95 KD or as several variant isoforms. The presence of certain CD44 variant (v) isoforms on neoplastic cells indicates poor prognosis in epithelial and lymphoid malignancies, as it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression of CD44 v3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 was analyzed in cells from 85 B-CLL patients. Indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to identify CD44v. Functional studies were performed by analysis of adhesion to hyaluronate (HA), one CD44 ligand, and HA-induced Ca2+ influx. A variety of statistical methods were used to define phenotypic and functional differences between the various clones, to calculate survival curves, and for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: In 17/85 B-CLL (20%), one or more CD44v were detectable by indirect immunofluorescence, whereas in 68/85 cases (80%) this technique yielded negative results. However, moAb ""mixes"" against CD44v and patching of surface molecules on B-CLL cells have shown that all B-CLL clones express CD44v. This has been confirmed by Western blot in a number of cases. Thus, two groups of patients whose cells bear CD44v at high or low density, are distinguished. Functions of the two clonotypes were investigated, namely their adhesion to a CD44 ligand and hyaluronate (HA), and effect on HA-induced Ca2+ influx. Cells expressing high density CD44v adhere to HA-coated substrates more efficiently than cells with low density CD44v. In all clones, HA-signaling via CD44 yields Ca2+ influx. This indicates that CD44 mediates activatory signals following interaction with the ligand. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The clinical relevance of these findings has been ascertained. The 17/85 cases whose cells bore high density CD44v had significantly worse prognostic features than those of patients with low density CD44v, namely more advanced disease stage, LDT < 12 months and therapy requirement. Moreover, the median survival in the former group of patients was < 5 years as opposed to > 12 years in the latter. Therefore, analysis of CD44v expression provides indications of biological and clinical relevance also in low grade lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Zarcone, D', 'De Rossi, G', 'Tenca, C', 'Marroni, P', 'Mauro, F R', 'Cerruti, G M', 'Albi, N', 'Fiorucci, S', 'Velardi, A', 'Grossi, C E']","['Zarcone D', 'De Rossi G', 'Tenca C', 'Marroni P', 'Mauro FR', 'Cerruti GM', 'Albi N', 'Fiorucci S', 'Velardi A', 'Grossi CE']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*immunology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology']",,1999/02/09 00:00,1999/02/09 00:01,['1999/02/09 00:00'],"['1999/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Dec;83(12):1088-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few systematic studies focusing on identification of the minor or undetectable B-cell subsets in normal human bone marrow (BM) which are frequently found in leukemic cells have been performed. Such studies could help to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in precursor-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor-B-ALL). The aim of the present study was to analyze the sequence of antigen expression among normal human CD19+ B cells from adult BM. Our major goal was to identify infrequent and undetectable B-cell phenotypes that could be used for the detection of MRD in patients with precursor-B-ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult BM samples from a total of 33 healthy volunteers were analyzed using triple stainings, and measured by flow cytometry. A sensitive method based on the two-step acquisition procedure was used for the identification and characterization of cells present at very low frequencies. RESULTS: Five different subsets of CD19+ cells were identified in normal BM samples according to their degree of maturation: 1) CD19+/CD34+/CD10-/CD20-/CD22dlm+ (0.5 +/- 0.4% B cells); 2) CD19+/CD34-/CD10++/CD20-/CD22dlm+ (3.4 +/- 2.7%); 3) CD19+/CD34-/CD10+/CD20-/CD22dlm+ (3.5 +/- 2.2%); 4) CD19+/CD34-/CD10+/CD20+,++/CD22dlm+ (21 +/- 11%), and 5) CD19+/CD34-/CD10-/CD20++/CD22+ (73 +/- 19%). We observed that several B-cell phenotypes are frequent among precursor-B-ALL, but are infrequent or undetectable in normal human B cell differentiation. Accordingly, in all normal BM samples analyzed, less than 4 x 10(-5) cells co-expressed CD19 and CD117; CD20strong+/CD34+ and CD22strong+/CD34+ events were found at frequencies less than 5 x 10(-4), while CD20+/CD34+ phenotypes were found in less than 1 x 10(-3) BM cells. Although both CD19+/CD13+ and CD19+/CD33+ events were found at frequencies of up to 3 x 10(-3), they never formed a well-defined population of cells and therefore these latter phenotypic patterns could also be of use for MRD investigation in CD13+ and/or CD33+ precursor-B-ALL cases. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in adult BM normal B-cells display constant patterns of maturation as regards both their phenotypic characteristics and their relative distribution. Abnormalities in these patterns provide a potentially useful tool for monitoring MRD in precursor-B-ALL patients who achieve cytomorphologic complete remission.","['Ciudad, J', 'Orfao, A', 'Vidriales, B', 'Macedo, A', 'Martinez, A', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Valverde, B', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Ciudad J', 'Orfao A', 'Vidriales B', 'Macedo A', 'Martinez A', 'Gonzalez M', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Valverde B', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio General de Citometria, University of Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*immunology/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology']",,1999/02/09 00:00,1999/02/09 00:01,['1999/02/09 00:00'],"['1999/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Dec;83(12):1069-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard treatments include surgical debridement of the involved tissues with possible orbital exenteration, intravenous antifungal therapy, and improvement of the host's immunocompetence and metabolic state, when possible. The role of conservative orbital debridement combined with local amphotericin B irrigations in the treatment of these patients was evaluated. METHODS: The records of seven consecutive patients with sino-orbital fungal infections, who were treated with limited surgical debridement and local and systemic amphotericin B therapy, were reviewed. The underlying disorders of these patients included acute lymphoblastic leukemia, immunosuppression after renal transplantation, diabetes mellitus, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The fungal species identified included Rhizopus, Mucor, and Aspergillus. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 4 years. All patients retained their preoperative visual acuities. Only one patient ultimately underwent an orbital exenteration for progressive orbital fungal infection. The remaining patients had either complete or incomplete (without further progression) resolution of their fungal infection. Two of the seven patients died of unrelated causes, and no patient died of uncontrolled fungal spread. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative orbital debridement with local amphotericin B irrigations is an effective adjunct in the control of sino-orbital fungal infections, especially in patients with reversible immunosuppression and good preoperative visual acuities.","['Seiff, S R', 'Choo, P H', 'Carter, S R']","['Seiff SR', 'Choo PH', 'Carter SR']","['Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Service, Beckman Vision Center, University of California San Francisco, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Debridement', 'Eye Infections, Fungal/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucor/isolation & purification', 'Mucormycosis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Orbital Diseases/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Paranasal Sinus Diseases/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Rhizopus/isolation & purification']",,1999/02/09 00:00,1999/02/09 00:01,['1999/02/09 00:00'],"['1999/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002341-199901000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 1999 Jan;15(1):28-31. doi: 10.1097/00002341-199901000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All were diffuse large-cell lymphomas, showed mono or oligoclonality and a 9/10 diploid cellular DNA content. Expression of a simian homologue to Epstein-Barr virus (HVMF-1) was shown in nine cases. The lymphomas showed moderate to high proliferative activity by Ki67 immunostaining and DNA flow cytometry, and a low number of apoptotic cells detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Immunohistochemistry showed abundant tumor infiltrating TIA-1(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) and macrophages. Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and also Bax and Bak, but not p53 were demonstrable in the tumor cells by immunostaining. Our findings suggest a causal relationship between HVMF-1 infection and a low apoptotic index of the lymphomas due to the expression of Bcl-2. The apparent inefficient function of tumor-infiltrating CTL could be due to inactivation of CTL and/or resistance of the lymphoma cells to CTL effects. The tumors showed immunoreactivity for CD18, CD29, and CD49d, but not for CD11a, mimicking the phenotype of human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphomas. In summary, our observations indicate a high similarity between this simian model of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas (ARL) and human ARL and other immunosuppression-related lymphomas.","['Castanos-Velez, E', 'Heiden, T', 'Ekman, M', 'Lawrence, J', 'Biberfeld, G', 'Biberfeld, P']","['Castanos-Velez E', 'Heiden T', 'Ekman M', 'Lawrence J', 'Biberfeld G', 'Biberfeld P']","['Immunopathology Laboratory, Karolinska Institute/Hospital, CCK, Stockholm, Sweden.E.C-Velez@onkpat.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', '*Simian Immunodeficiency Virus', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,1999/02/09 00:00,1999/02/09 00:01,['1999/02/09 00:00'],"['1999/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48775-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 15;93(4):1364-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applying the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method, we found a cryptic translocation t(12;15)(p13;q25) in an adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient. Hybridization with cosmid probes showed that the ETV6 gene was rearranged in this translocation. A patient-specific cDNA library was screened with ETV6 cDNA, and a novel fusion transcript was identified between the ETV6 and TRKC/NTRK3 gene located on 15q25. TRKC is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). It is known to be expressed broadly in neural tissues but not in hematologic cells, so far. ETV6-TRKC chimeric transcript encoded the pointed (PNT) domain of the ETV6 gene that fused to the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain of the TRKC gene. Two types of fusion transcript were determined, one that included the entire PTK domain of TRKC and the other in which the 3'-terminal 462 bp of TRKC was truncated within the PTK domain. Western blot analysis showed the expression of both chimeric proteins of 52 and 38 kD in size. Our results suggest that chimeric PTK expressed in the leukemic cells may contribute to cellular transformation by abnormally activating TRK signaling pathways.

Here, we report that Bcr-Abl through a Ras-dependent pathway signals the serine/threonine protein kinase GCKR (Germinal Center Kinase Related) leading to SAPK activation. Either an oncogenic form of Ras or Bcr-Abl enhances GCKR catalytic activity and its activation of SAPK, whereas inhibition of GCKR impairs Bcr-Abl-induced SAPK activation. Bcr-Abl mutants that are impaired for GCKR activation are also unable to activate SAPK. Consistent with GCKR being a functional target in CML, GCKR is constitutively active in CML cell lines and found in association with Bcr-Abl.

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, which is used extensively in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, induced a potent apoptotic response in human neuroblastoma cells. This apoptotic response was triggered at lower concentrations and occurred more rapidly than had been previously reported in other tumor-derived cell lines, including breast and prostate carcinomas. Because of the increased sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of this agent on a variety of tumor cells, including leukemic cell lines and primary patient samples. Based on a variety of cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, the 6 acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines tested displayed a weak apoptotic response to lovastatin. In contrast, the majority of the acute myeloid leukemic cell lines (6/7) and primary cell cultures (13/22) showed significant sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, similar to the neuroblastoma cell response. Of significance, in the acute myeloid leukemia, but not the acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines, lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity was pronounced even at the physiological relevant concentrations of this agent.

A generally accepted hypothesis is that the physical proximity of the involved chromosomal regions may be one important factor in the genesis of these phenomena. Accordingly, a likely possibility is that such a proximity may occur in a cell-lineage and cell-differentiation stage-specific manner. In this work, we have addressed this issue using as models the ABL and BCR genes of t(9;22) and the PML and RARalpha genes of t(15;17). By using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, we have measured the distances between these two pairs of genes in three-dimensionally preserved hematopoietic cells belonging to different cell lineages, at various stages of differentiation, and at various stages of the cell cycle, with the following results. (1) Intergenic distances vary periodically during the cell cycle and a significant association of ABL with BCR and of PML with RARalpha is seen at the transition between S and G2, which persists during G2 and prophase (such a behavior is not observed for distances between ABL or PML and the beta-globin genes, used as a control). (2) The proportion of cells in which PML and RARalpha or ABL and BCR are closely associated is higher in hematopoietic precursors than in B-lymphoid cells (whereas the distances between ABL or PML and the beta-globin genes are not affected by cell type). (3) When intergenic distances in unstimulated bone marrow CD34(+) cells were compared with those in CD34(+) cells treated with interleukin-3 (IL-3), a trend towards a higher proximity of the ABL and BCR genes in the former and of the PML and RARalpha genes in the latter is observed. (4) Analysis of B-lymphoid cells during mitosis shows that intergenic distances at metaphase are strongly influenced by physical constraints imposed by the chromosomal location of the gene, by the size of the respective chromosome, and by the geometry of the metaphase plate. These findings suggest that intrinsic spatial dynamics, established early in hematopoiesis and perpetuated differentially in distinct cell lineages, may facilitate the collision of individual genes and thus reciprocal recombination between them at subsequent stages of hematopoietic differentiation.","['Neves, H', 'Ramos, C', 'da Silva, M G', 'Parreira, A', 'Parreira, L']","['Neves H', 'Ramos C', 'da Silva MG', 'Parreira A', 'Parreira L']","['Institute of Histology and Embryology, Lisbon Medical School, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics/ultrastructure', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/02/09 00:00,1999/02/09 00:01,['1999/02/09 00:00'],"['1999/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48757-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 15;93(4):1197-207.,,,,,,['Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1137-8.

However its role, if any, in other tissues remains undefined. Although transfection experiments have indicated that it may be unable to confer drug resistance, there is evidence that it may be involved in drug resistance in certain B-cell leukaemias. To date, most work on clinical samples has been performed at the mRNA level; limited work has been performed using polyclonal antibodies raised to MDR-3 and mdr-2 (the murine equivalent of MDR-3). We have generated a new monoclonal antibody, termed 6/1G, which specifically recognises the human MDR-3 gene-encoded product. Antibody 6/1G was produced by in vitro immunisation of spleen cells from BALB/c mice with a synthetic 12-amino acid peptide. Cells from MDR-3 transgenic mice showed consistent membranous staining with antibody 6/1G. Immunoblotting with 6/1G identified a band at 170 kDa on lysates of MDR-3 transgenic cells. Preliminary results with a range of B-cell leukaemias suggest that MDR-3 Pgp positivity may be a marker for a more malignant phenotype in B-CLL. Antibody 6/1G may be useful in defining a role for MDR-3 in malignancy and drug resistance, as well as in certain liver diseases such as progressive familial intracholeostasis.","['Larkin, A', 'Moran, E', 'Alexander, D', 'Doherty, G', 'Connolly, L', 'Kennedy, S M', 'Clynes, M']","['Larkin A', 'Moran E', 'Alexander D', 'Doherty G', 'Connolly L', 'Kennedy SM', 'Clynes M']","['National Cell and Tissue Culture Centre, Bioresearch Ireland, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland. annemarie.larkin@dcu.ie']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Genes, MDR', 'Genetic Code', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleases']",,1999/02/06 03:14,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/06 03:14'],"['1999/02/06 03:14 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/06 03:14 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990118)80:2<265::AID-IJC16>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990118)80:2<265::aid-ijc16>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Jan 18;80(2):265-71. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990118)80:2<265::aid-ijc16>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed a series of 124 patients with a secondary CKS (8.4% of a total of 1485 incident cases) which occurred between 1961 and 1992 in the Jewish Israeli population. Data on first neoplasms and subsequent Kaposi's sarcoma were retrieved from the Israel Cancer Registry. Acquired-immune-deficiency-syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcomas were excluded from the case series. Four controls were randomly selected for each CKS case among all Cancer Registry cases free from a second neoplasm at the time of diagnosis of the CKS in the case, and matched on gender, year of birth and year of diagnosis of the first neoplasm. The average time lapse between first neoplasm and secondary CKS was 4.5 years, being shorter for prostate cancer and for hematopoietic malignancies. As compared with Israel-born Jews, the risk of a subsequent CKS was significantly increased in immigrants [odds ratio (OR) 3.0]; this risk was particularly high in immigrants from the former Soviet Union (OR 9.4) and Poland (OR 7.0). There was no clear trend with age at immigration; however, low age at immigration and a short length of stay in Israel endowed a higher risk of developing a secondary CKS, markedly among patients suffering from solid tumors as the first primary. There was an excess of secondary CKS following a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 5.3), a Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 7.5), a leukemia (OR 5.3) or a breast cancer (OR 2.2). Cancer patients with a first primary in the lung, colon, stomach, larynx, liver, pancreas or kidney showed secondary CKS less frequently. Despite the lack of control of therapy for the first neoplasm, development of secondary CKS seems to be mediated by mechanisms similar to those for hematopoietic neoplasms and selected nonhematopoietic neoplasms, such as breast cancer. The trend toward increased risk after a short time lapse and the difference in risk among immigrants indicate that genetic susceptibility is part of the complex interplay between cellular proliferation and control systems.","['Iscovich, J', 'Boffetta, P', 'Winkelmann, R', 'Brennan, P']","['Iscovich J', 'Boffetta P', 'Winkelmann R', 'Brennan P']","['Israel Cancer Registry, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem. iscovich@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/virology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*epidemiology/pathology/virology']",,1999/02/06 03:14,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/06 03:14'],"['1999/02/06 03:14 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/06 03:14 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990118)80:2<178::AID-IJC3>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990118)80:2<178::aid-ijc3>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Jan 18;80(2):178-82. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990118)80:2<178::aid-ijc3>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mediates the effect of growth hormone and has been positively associated with prostate cancer, we have evaluated the role of this hormone and its principal binding protein, IGFBP-3, in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. Incident cases of childhood leukaemia from those recorded by a national network of childhood oncologists were enrolled in our study. Controls were children hospitalised for acute conditions of no more than moderate severity with matching for gender, age and maternal place of residence. Blood measurements of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were undertaken using commercially available radioimmunoassays. Serum IGF-I values decreased by about 1.7% per month, and the rate of decline was higher, though not significantly so, among cases (2.1% per month) than among controls (1.4%). There was no significant association between IGF-I and the likelihood of childhood leukaemia, but an increment of 1 microg/ml of IGFBP-3 was associated with a substantial and statistically significant reduction of childhood leukaemia by 28% (95% confidence interval 7% to 45%). Because IGFBP-3 is essentially a binding protein, we interpret our findings as indicating that bioavailable IGF-I may play an important role in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. The much smaller quantities and the inherent instability of IGF-I in the blood in comparison to those of IGFBP-3 are likely to hinder documentation of an underlying positive association of IGF-I with the disease.","['Petridou, E', 'Dessypris, N', 'Spanos, E', 'Mantzoros, C', 'Skalkidou, A', 'Kalmanti, M', 'Koliouskas, D', 'Kosmidis, H', 'Panagiotou, J P', 'Piperopoulou, F', 'Tzortzatou, F', 'Trichopoulos, D']","['Petridou E', 'Dessypris N', 'Spanos E', 'Mantzoros C', 'Skalkidou A', 'Kalmanti M', 'Koliouskas D', 'Kosmidis H', 'Panagiotou JP', 'Piperopoulou F', 'Tzortzatou F', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Greece. epetrid@atlas.uoa.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*blood/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Regression Analysis']",,1999/02/06 03:14,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/06 03:14'],"['1999/02/06 03:14 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/06 03:14 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990209)80:4<494::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990209)80:4<494::aid-ijc2>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Feb 9;80(4):494-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990209)80:4<494::aid-ijc2>3.0.co;2-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article describes the pharmacokinetic, bioactivity, toxicity and chemical characteristics of alpha-particle-emitting, 213Bi and 212Bi radiometal conjugated HuM195 (anti-CD33) constructs. Conjugation of HuM195 to SCN-CHX-A-DTPA resulted in the attachment of up to 10 chelating ligand molecules per antibody. RESULTS: Radiolabeling efficiency of the CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 construct with 213Bi was 78%+/-10% (n = 46) after 10 min at specific activities of up to 1110 MBq/mg. The immunoreactivity of the 213Bi-labeled CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 construct was 84%+/-10% (n = 28) and was independent of the specific activity. The bismuth-labeled CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 construct was rapidly internalized into the cell in a time-dependent manner ranging from 50% at 1 h to 65% at 24 h. 205Bi/206Bi-labeled constructs were stable for at least 2 d in vitro in the presence of human serum at 37 degrees C. After injection into mice, there was no uptake or loss of bismuth to mouse tissues, which do not express CD33, or to the kidney, which has avidity for free bismuth. Mice injected intraperitoneally with doses of (213Bi)CHX-A-DTPA-HuM1 95 ranging from 18.5 to 740 MBq/kg showed no toxicity, but at 2590 MBq/kg, two of the three mice died within 2 wk and a third mouse showed significant reductions in white blood cell counts. Mice injected intravenously with doses of (213Bi)CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 up to 370 MBq/kg exhibited little toxicity, but 666 MBq/kg was above the MTD for mice. Leukemia cell killing in vitro with bismuth-labeled HuM1 95 showed dose- and specific activity-dependent killing of CD33+ HL60 cells; approximately 50% killing was observed when two bismuth atoms (50 fM radiolabeled antibody) were initially bound onto the target cell surface. CONCLUSION: Alpha-emitting antibodies are among the most potent cytotoxic agents known, yet are specific and appear safe in vivo. The physical and biochemical characteristics of the 213Bi isotope and its generation, as well as the biochemistry of the 213Bi-labeled CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 construct, make it possible to use the constructs safely and feasibly in humans at therapeutic levels.","['Nikula, T K', 'McDevitt, M R', 'Finn, R D', 'Wu, C', 'Kozak, R W', 'Garmestani, K', 'Brechbiel, M W', 'Curcio, M J', 'Pippin, C G', 'Tiffany-Jones, L', 'Geerlings, M W Sr', 'Apostolidis, C', 'Molinet, R', 'Geerlings, M W Jr', 'Gansow, O A', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Nikula TK', 'McDevitt MR', 'Finn RD', 'Wu C', 'Kozak RW', 'Garmestani K', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Curcio MJ', 'Pippin CG', 'Tiffany-Jones L', 'Geerlings MW Sr', 'Apostolidis C', 'Molinet R', 'Geerlings MW Jr', 'Gansow OA', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 ((213)Bi-CHX-A-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-HuM195)', '0 (2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pentetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/immunology/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",,1999/02/06 03:14,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/02/06 03:14'],"['1999/02/06 03:14 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 03:14 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1999 Jan;40(1):166-76.,"['P01 CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA58260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Incidence rates near German nuclear installations were compared to rates in control regions based on the German Childhood Cancer Registry. RESULTS: No exploratory result could be reproduced. This is also true for children with acute leukemia younger than 5 years who were living within a 5 km radius of an installation: an observed relative risk (RR) of 1.39 was not significantly increased (95 percent confidence interval CI: 0.69-2.57). Former confirmatory results could be confirmed again. A pooled analysis of both studies based on 2390 cases resulted in RR of 0.99 for all malignancies (CI: 0.91-1.07) and of 1.00 for acute leukemias (CI: 0.87-1.16) (children younger than 15 years of age living within a 15 km radius). CONCLUSIONS: Results did not show significantly increased incidence rates for any subgroup with previously significant exploratory results. Therefore, it appears to be most likely that the previous results were just due to chance. Evaluating the previously confirmatory results with the combined data from the two study periods reassures that incidence rates are not increased in children younger than 15 years who are living within a 15 km radius, either for all malignancies or for acute leukemias.

Three scrapie strains (ME7, 22L and 139A) that had a comparatively short incubation period in SAMP8 and AKR mice caused an increase in brain MuLV titres that was scrapie strain-specific: in each mouse strain, the greatest effect was with 1 39A, and the least with ME7. The 22A scrapie strain, which has a long incubation period in SAMP8 mice, did not affect MuLV titres in brains of this mouse strain.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty cases of peripheral T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas, classified according to the REAL classification, were investigated for cytotoxic phenotype (by studying T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) expression immunohistochemically) and EBV association (by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs), and the results were correlated with the specific clinicopathological types and the immunophenotype with special emphasis on CD56 expression and CD4/CD8 status. Overall, 39/80 cases (49%) expressed TIA-1. Angiocentric lymphoma (23/24 cases; 96%), aggressive NK-cell leukaemia ('large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia') (3/3 cases; 100%), intestinal T-cell lymphoma (5/6 cases; 83%) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (4/6 cases; 67%) were the major subtypes showing a cytotoxic phenotype. Only four of the 27 cases (15%) of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified, were TIA-1+, while all the seven cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, six cases of mycosis fungoides and one case of adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia were TIA-1-. CONCLUSIONS: Within the group of peripheral T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas, angiocentric lymphoma, aggressive NK-cell leukaemia ('LGL leukaemia'), intestinal T-cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma are the major subtypes displaying a cytotoxic phenotype. The relationships between the cytotoxic phenotype and EBV association, CD56 expression or CD4/CD8 status are secondary to the relationship between cytotoxic phenotype and specific lymphoma subtype.","['Chan, A C', 'Ho, J W', 'Chiang, A K', 'Srivastava, G']","['Chan AC', 'Ho JW', 'Chiang AK', 'Srivastava G']","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology/virology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*immunology/*pathology/virology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis']",,1999/02/06 00:00,1999/02/06 00:01,['1999/02/06 00:00'],"['1999/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1999.00582.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1999 Jan;34(1):16-24. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1999.00582.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data demonstrate that hypoxia powerfully enhances IRE/IRP-1 binding in human cell lines. Using the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B as a model, we found that 16 h in a 1% oxygen atmosphere markedly increases IRE/IRP-1 binding as assessed by electromobility shift assay. Hypoxia also decreased cytosolic aconitase activity. The hypoxia-enhanced IRE/IRP-1 binding stabilized the transferrin receptor message, increased the cellular mRNA content by over 10-fold, and doubled surface receptor expression. Simultaneously, hypoxia suppressed ferritin message translation. Hypoxia's effect was most strikingly depicted by the absence of ferritin synthesis in cells challenged with inorganic iron. Our results contrast with previously reported data (Hanson, E. S., and Leibold, E. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7588-7593) in which a 3% oxygen atmosphere reduced IRE/IRP-1 binding in rat hepatoma cells. We discuss some possible reasons for the differences. In aggregate with other investigations involving responses to hypoxia, iron, or nitric oxide, our data indicate that cellular iron metabolic responses are complex and that IRE/IRP-1 interactions vary between cell lines and perhaps between species.","['Toth, I', 'Yuan, L', 'Rogers, J T', 'Boyce, H', 'Bridges, K R']","['Toth I', 'Yuan L', 'Rogers JT', 'Boyce H', 'Bridges KR']","[""Joint Center for Sickle Cell and Thalassemic Disorders, Hematology Division, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Surface Properties', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/06 00:00,1999/02/06 00:01,['1999/02/06 00:00'],"['1999/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.7.4467 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87933-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 12;274(7):4467-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.7.4467.,['HL 457940/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have shown that treatment of purified topoisomerase I with caspase-3 resulted in cleavage at DDVD146 downward arrowY and EEED170 downward arrowG, whereas treatment with caspase-6 resulted in cleavage at PEDD123 downward arrowG and EEED170 downward arrowG. After treatment of Jurkat T lymphocytic leukemia cells with anti-Fas antibody or A549 lung cancer cells with topotecan, etoposide, or paclitaxel, the topoisomerase I fragment comigrated with the product that resulted from caspase-3 cleavage at DDVD146 downward arrowY. In contrast, two discrete topoisomerase I fragments that appeared to result from cleavage at DDVD146 downward arrowY and EEED170 downward arrowG were observed after treatment of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with paclitaxel. Topoisomerase I cleavage did not occur in apoptotic MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3. Cell fractionation and band depletion studies with the topoisomerase I poison topotecan revealed that the topoisomerase I fragment remains in proximity to the chromatin and retains the ability to bind to and cleave DNA. These observations indicate that topoisomerase I is a substrate of caspase-3 and possibly caspase-6, but is cleaved at sequences that differ from those ordinarily preferred by these enzymes, thereby providing a potential explanation why topoisomerase I cleavage lags behind that of classical caspase substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin B1.","['Samejima, K', 'Svingen, P A', 'Basi, G S', 'Kottke, T', 'Mesner, P W Jr', 'Stewart, L', 'Durrieu, F', 'Poirier, G G', 'Alnemri, E S', 'Champoux, J J', 'Kaufmann, S H', 'Earnshaw, W C']","['Samejima K', 'Svingen PA', 'Basi GS', 'Kottke T', 'Mesner PW Jr', 'Stewart L', 'Durrieu F', 'Poirier GG', 'Alnemri ES', 'Champoux JJ', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Earnshaw WC']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spodoptera']",,1999/02/06 03:13,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/02/06 03:13'],"['1999/02/06 03:13 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 03:13 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.7.4335 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87917-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 12;274(7):4335-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.7.4335.,"['CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM49156/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG13487/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these, the adjacent UE-A and TSEI elements, located from -113 to -85 relative to the transcription initiation site, function in combination and act as a pancreas-specific mini-enhancer. The TSEI element is recognized by the pancreatic homeodomain factor PDX1. In the present study, we show that the UE-A element binds a heterodimeric complex composed of a Pbx factor and the Prep1 protein, both belonging to the atypical three-amino acid loop extension homeodomain family. Recombinant Pbx1 and Prep1 proteins bind cooperatively to the UE-A site, whereas neither protein can bind this site alone. Transient transfection experiments reveal that both Pbx1 and Prep1 are required to generate a strong transcriptional activation from the UE-A element when this element is inserted close to the TATA box. In contrast, in the context of the intact somatostatin promoter or mini-enhancer, Pbx1 and Prep1 alone have no effect, but they produce a drastic activation when the pancreatic homeodomain factor PDX1 is also coexpressed. Thus, the activity of the somatostatin mini-enhancer is mediated by a cooperative interaction between the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimeric complex and the pancreatic factor PDX1.","['Goudet, G', 'Delhalle, S', 'Biemar, F', 'Martial, J A', 'Peers, B']","['Goudet G', 'Delhalle S', 'Biemar F', 'Martial JA', 'Peers B']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et de Genie Genetique, Institut de Chimie, Batiment B6, Universite de Liege, B-4000 Sart-Tilman, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Somatostatin/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/06 00:00,1999/02/06 00:01,['1999/02/06 00:00'],"['1999/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.7.4067 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87881-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 12;274(7):4067-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.7.4067.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether the sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway is involved in cellular signaling of the Gi protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor in myeloid differentiated human leukemia (HL-60) cells. Receptor activation resulted in rapid and transient production of SPP by sphingosine kinase, which was abolished after pertussis toxin treatment. Direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by AlF4- also rapidly increased SPP formation in intact HL-60 cells. In cytosolic preparations of HL-60 cells, sphingosine kinase activity was stimulated by the stable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Inhibition of sphingosine kinase by DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine and N,N-dimethylsphingosine did not affect phospholipase C stimulation and superoxide production but markedly inhibited receptor-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization and enzyme release. We conclude that the formyl peptide receptor stimulates through Gi-type G proteins SPP production by sphingosine kinase, that the enzyme is also stimulated by direct G protein activation, and that the sphingosine kinase/SPP pathway apparently plays an important role in chemoattractant signaling in myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells.","['Alemany, R', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf, D', 'van Koppen, C J', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Alemany R', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf D', 'van Koppen CJ', 'Jakobs KH']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, D-45122 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (N-methylsphingosine)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Lysophospholipids', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/*physiology', 'Second Messenger Systems', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",,1999/02/06 00:00,1999/02/06 00:01,['1999/02/06 00:00'],"['1999/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.7.3994 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87872-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 12;274(7):3994-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.7.3994.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This resistance is mediated by the chimeric tyrosine kinase oncogene Bcr-Abl. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl protects K562 cells from apoptosis. We recently demonstrated that expression of PKCiota is necessary for the resistance of K562 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis (Murray, N. R., and Fields, A. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 27521-27524). We now demonstrate that treatment of K562 cells with taxol leads to sustained activation of PKCiota. In contrast, Bcr-Abl-negative HL60 myeloid leukemia cells, which are sensitive to taxol-induced apoptosis, do not exhibit sustained PKCiota activation in response to taxol. Treatment of K562 cells with tyrphostin AG957, a selective Bcr-Abl inhibitor, blocks taxol-induced PKCiota activation and sensitizes these cells to taxol-induced apoptosis, indicating that PKCiota is a relevant downstream target of Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active PKCiota by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer rescues AG957-treated K562 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both Bcr-Abl and PKCiota activity are necessary for apoptotic resistance in K562 cells. Furthermore, they identify PKCiota as a critical downstream target of Bcr-Abl that is sufficient to mediate the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcr-Abl.","['Jamieson, L', 'Carpenter, L', 'Biden, T J', 'Fields, A P']","['Jamieson L', 'Carpenter L', 'Biden TJ', 'Fields AP']","['Sealy Center for Oncology and Hematology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-1048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (tyrphostin AG957)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C lambda)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",,1999/02/06 00:00,1999/02/06 00:01,['1999/02/06 00:00'],"['1999/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.7.3927 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87861-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 12;274(7):3927-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.7.3927.,['CA56869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The knowledge of open heart surgery in patients with this disorder is limited. METHODS: Twelve patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia underwent open heart surgery (nine coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), two aortic valve replacement (AVR), one CABG and AVR) from September 1991 to September 1996. There were nine males and three females with a mean age of 68 years (41-81 years). Staging was assigned according to the Rai Classification. There were seven Stage 0, two Stage I, zero Stage II, one Stage III and two Stage IV patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed using standard techniques of cannulation, moderate hypothermia and antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia. RESULTS: Hospital mortality occurred in two (17%) patients. Both patients died of sepsis. Hospital morbidity occurred in seven (58%) patients. The most common complications were infections. Five patients were found to have other malignancies (basal cell, laryngeal, prostate, bladder and breast cancers). Transfusion of blood products was required in eight (67%) patients. The average length of stay was 15 days (7-50 days). Follow-up was complete. Late mortality occurred in four patients at a mean of 7 months (1-18 months). All deaths were non-cardiac related (ruptured AAA, kidney failure, respiratory failure and sepsis). Six patients remain alive at a mean of 25 months (1-48 months). CONCLUSION: Hospital mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing open heart surgery are high. Infection is the leading cause of hospital death, as well as the most common complication. The majority of patients receive blood products during the course of their hospitalization. Late mortality is high and non-cardiac related. Based on these findings, a re-definition of the aims, goals and expectations of open heart surgery in patients with chronic leukemia is necessary. Suggestions in management are presented.","['Samuels, L E', 'Kaufman, M S', 'Morris, R J', 'Styler, M', 'Brockman, S K']","['Samuels LE', 'Kaufman MS', 'Morris RJ', 'Styler M', 'Brockman SK']","['Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Allegheny University Hospitals, Philadelphia, PA 19102-1192, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cardiac Surgical Procedures/mortality', 'Female', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S014521269800126X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00126-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Jan;23(1):71-5. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00126-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent study reported c-mpl mRNA overexpression in 60% of a small sample of AML patients, and this overexpression correlates with shorter complete remission but not with karyotype group. We quantified c-mpl protein expression in 107 cases of AML and 24 normal bone marrow and 12 normal peripheral blood samples by using Western blot analysis and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Western blot analysis revealed no detectable level of c-mpl protein in the normal samples, whereas trace amounts were detected by RIA. c-mpl protein expression was increased (> or = twice normal) in 65% of the AML cases. c-mpl protein expression was correlated with cytogenetic groups (P = 0.0009, Kruskal-Wallis test in rejecting the hypothesis that c-mpl expression was the same in different groups). Specifically, patients with favorable cytogenetic groups (t(8;21), inv16, and t(15;17)) had lower c-mpl protein expression (median 1.7 times normal), whereas patients with unfavorable abnormalities (+8, -5 or -7, and del(11)(q23)) and normal cytogenetics had high expression (3.1 and 2.85 times normal, respectively). The findings were the same when only the 61 untreated AML patients were considered. No statistically significant correlation between c-mpl expression and age or antecedent hematologic disorder was found. These results suggest that c-mpl protein overexpression in AML may play a role in the aggressiveness of this disease.","['Albitar, M', 'Manshouri, T', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Faber, J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Pierce, S', 'Estey, E']","['Albitar M', 'Manshouri T', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M', 'Estrov Z', 'Faber J', 'Freireich EJ', 'Pierce S', 'Estey E']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Radioimmunoassay', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Survival Analysis']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001325 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00132-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Jan;23(1):63-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00132-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to its selective differentiation effect, BC-4 strongly inhibited growth of all cell lines tested. The growth inhibition effect was dose- and time-dependent. In HL-60 cells, 20 microg/ml (38.8 microM) of BC-4 decreased viable cell number by 60% at 24 h, whereas at 3 days there was virtually no viable cells.

With the exception of mitozantrone, the addition of CSA and PSC 833 to cytotoxic agents failed to significantly improve cytotoxicity, even in the Pgp positive group. With mitozantrone significant responses were seen in both Pgp positive and negative groups suggesting that the responses were due to direct cytotoxicity of the cytotoxic-modifier combination rather than reversal of MDR.

The responses were disappointing compared to the highly significant improvements in cytotoxicity seen using cells from the Pgp positive CEM VLB 100 acute myeloid leukaemia cell line, and it was not possible to demonstrate the superiority of PSC 833 over CSA which is also seen in cell lines.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of T-cell type is a rather heterogeneous group of ALL at least by immunophenotyping. Our aim was to present a comprehensive characterization of frequently used T-cell leukemia cell lines and to suggest a correlation with the normal differentiation pattern. A total of 16 T-ALL cell lines were analyzed for their immunophenotype and for T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement and expression. The panel of 20 cell surface markers included two new monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), TC-12 and TH-111, which were raised in our laboratory and detect subpopulations of T-cell ALL. TC-12 was typed 'unique', TH-111 was assigned to the CD96 cluster at the Vth Conference on human leucocyte differentiation antigens (HLDA). We categorized the 16 cell lines into the four groups pro-T, pre-T, cortical T and mature T differentiation stage according to the recent proposal of the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL).

In this study, the role of physiologic concentrations of SCF on the proliferation and differentiation on MDS progenitor cells was further analyzed in the presence of combined cytokines. For this purpose, marrow CD34+ cells were purified up to 94% for 12 normal individuals and 90% for 18 MDS patients, using monoclonal antibodies and immunomagnetic microspheres. The purified CD34+ cells were cultured for 14 days with saturating doses of cytokines, including recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (rM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rIL-3) and rSCF. The clonal growth of MDS CD34+ cells supported by a combination of all the above cytokines was then subdivided into the two patterns of leukemic or non-leukemic. The role of various concentrations of rSCF (0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 ng ml(-1)), with or without the above cytokines, in proliferation and differentiation of MDS CD34+ cells was analyzed in each group. The physiologic concentration of SCF at 5 ng ml(-1) significantly increased undifferentiated 'blast cell' colonies or clusters in leukemic type growth of MDS CD34+ cells over that seen in normal CD34+ cells. SCF is present in plasma at a level of ng ml(-1). This means that progenitor cells are continuously exposed to stimulation by SCF in vivo and that MDS leukemic cells have a growth advantage over normal blasts.","['Sawada, K', 'Koizumi, K', 'Tarumi, T', 'Takano, H', 'Ieko, M', 'Nishio, M', 'Fukada, Y', 'Yasukouchi, T', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Koike, T']","['Sawada K', 'Koizumi K', 'Tarumi T', 'Takano H', 'Ieko M', 'Nishio M', 'Fukada Y', 'Yasukouchi T', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Koike T']","['Department of Medicine II, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001283 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00128-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Jan;23(1):1-11. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00128-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TCR beta-chain variable region (Vbeta) repertoires in the lymphatic organs were normal in transgenic mice, however, specific Vbeta-positive T cells were expanded oligoclonally in the affected joints, suggesting that specific antigens, but not superantigens, were involved in the expansion of these T cells. These expanded T cells had the same TCR as those of lymph node T cells reactive to type II collagen (IIC). Moreover, these mice were susceptible to IIC-induced arthritis and oligoclonal T cells of the same Vbeta specificity as that found in spontaneously developed arthritic joint accumulated in the arthritic joints after immunization with IIC. These observations show that endogenous IIC is one of the arthritogenic antigens in the joint, suggesting tolerance break to this antigen in pX-transgenic mice.","['Kotani, M', 'Tagawa, Y', 'Iwakura, Y']","['Kotani M', 'Tagawa Y', 'Iwakura Y']","['Division of Cell Biology, Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*etiology/genetics/immunology', '*Autoimmunity', 'Base Sequence', 'Collagen/*immunology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1999/02/05 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/05 03:02'],"['1999/02/05 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/05 03:02 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199901)29:01<54::AID-IMMU54>3.0.CO;2-M [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1999 Jan;29(1):54-64. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199901)29:01<54::AID-IMMU54>3.0.CO;2-M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both drugs are phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK); the triphosphates, dFdCTP and ara-CTP, respectively, are incorporated into DNA. In the murine leukemia cell line L1210, induction of resistance to ara-C resulted in the 2200-fold resistant subline L4A6. The Brown Norway rat myelocytic leukemia ara-C-sensitive cell line (BCLO) was >300-fold more sensitive to ara-C than its variant Bara-C. In L1210 cells, gemcitabine was 8-fold more active than ara-C; in L4A6, BCLO, and Bara-C cells, gemcitabine was 16-, 28-, and more than 3-fold more active than ara-C, respectively. A partial explanation for these differences may be the higher dCK activity in the parental cell lines L1210 and BCLO with gemcitabine compared to ara-C as a substrate. DCK activity was not or hardly detectable in the resistant L4A6 and Bara-C cell. In the rat leukemia cell lines, deoxycytidine (dCyd) phosphorylation activity showed an aberrant pattern, since the activity with dCyd was 1.5-fold higher in the Bara-C cell line compared with BCLO, possibly due to thymidine kinase 2. The wild-type L1210 cells accumulated at least 3-fold more ara-CTP and dFdCTP than the rat leukemia cell line BCLO. The ara-C-resistant variants L4A6 and Bara-C did not accumulate dFdCTP or ara-CTP. In conclusion, gemcitabine was more active than ara-C in all leukemia cell lines tested. The sensitivity of the wild-type cell lines correlates with the accumulation of dFdCTP and ara-CTP, but is independent of dCK. However, both resistant variants had decreased dCK activities, but were relatively more sensitive to dFdC than to ara-C.","['Bergman, A M', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Jongsma, A P', 'Brouwer, M', 'Ruiz van Haperen, V W', 'Veerman, G', 'Leyva, A', 'Eriksson, S', 'Peters, G J']","['Bergman AM', 'Pinedo HM', 'Jongsma AP', 'Brouwer M', 'Ruiz van Haperen VW', 'Veerman G', 'Leyva A', 'Eriksson S', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital VU, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Polyphosphates)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)', 'NU43IAG5BC (triphosphoric acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/metabolism', 'Polyphosphates/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00318-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00318-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Feb 15;57(4):397-406. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00318-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the utility of the technique, we performed the procedure to treat hemorrhage not from esophageal varices during emergency endoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bleeding was identified from gastric Dieulafoy's ulcers (n=4), duodenal ulcers (n=3), gastric angiodysplasia (n=2) and Mallory-Weiss tears (n=3). The bleeding points were aspirated and controlled by endoscopic ligation and complete hemostasis was achieved in all cases. RESULTS: Although these lesions were located in difficult areas where endoscopic injection therapy and clipping sometimes fail, endoscopic ligation was performed easily and effectively without complications. Six of the patients had severe underlying disease, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal failure; none suffered deterioration in their general condition after endoscopic ligation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that endoscopic ligation is an easy and effective method of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage not from esophageal varices, and is safe even in patients with poor general health.","['Wong, R M', 'Ota, S', 'Katoh, A', 'Yamauchi, A', 'Arai, K', 'Kaneko, K', 'Yazawa, M', 'Matsuzaki, F']","['Wong RM', 'Ota S', 'Katoh A', 'Yamauchi A', 'Arai K', 'Kaneko K', 'Yazawa M', 'Matsuzaki F']","['First Dept. of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical School, Kawagoe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Endoscopy,Endoscopy,0215166,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Duodenal Ulcer/complications/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Endoscopy, Digestive System', 'Esophageal and Gastric Varices/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia/complications/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery', '*Hemostasis, Endoscopic/methods', 'Humans', 'Ligation', 'Male', 'Mallory-Weiss Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage/diagnosis/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Ulcer/complications/diagnosis/*surgery']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1001420 [doi]'],ppublish,Endoscopy. 1998 Nov;30(9):774-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1001420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The weights and heights of 1718 children with cancers were determined and converted into standard deviation (SD) scores, both at birth and at diagnosis, by using the means and SD values of the general population. RESULTS: Among patients with neuroblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the percentages of children with body weight and height over mean + 2 SDs were significantly higher at diagnosis than the expected value in the general population. The percentage of children with neuroblastoma and body weight over mean + 2 SD increased significantly from birth through diagnosis (P =.04). Although the medians of weight SD scores decreased from birth through diagnosis in patients with representative cancers except for neuroblastoma, the value significantly increased in patients with neuroblastoma diagnosed before 1 year of age (P =.03), especially in those whose cancer was detected by mass screening at 6 months of age (P <.01).

On the other hand, the detailed function and the sites of expression of tal-2 have remained obscure. We cloned the tal-2 cDNA from a mouse embryonic cDNA library and examined its expression pattern in the mouse, comparing with that of tal-1. In situ analyses revealed that tal-2 transcripts are detected at embryonic day 12.5 in the following regions; 1) the diencephalon-the zona limitans intrathalamica and the pretectum, 2) the mesencephalon-the tectum, and the anterior and posterior tegmentum, 3) the metencephalon-the isthmus and the anterior pons. In the diencephalon and the mesencephalon, the expression sites of tal-2 gene were similar to those of tal-1, and its expression was stronger than that of tal-1. In the metencephalon, tal-2 expression was observed in the anterior pons, whereas tal-1 transcripts were detected in the entire pons, and showed stronger expression than tal-2. The tal-2 messages were barely detectable in the brain at birth.

The novel gene, AIRE, contains a putative bipartite nuclear targeting signal predicting a nuclear location of the corresponding protein. The presence of two PHD-type zinc finger domains as well as the newly described putative DNA-binding domain, SAND, in the amino acid sequence of the APECED protein implies that it may be involved in the regulation of gene expression. Using transient expression of AIRE cDNA in mammalian cells we demonstrate here the nuclear location of the APECED protein. Immunohistochemical staining of transfected cells revealed that most of the recombinant 58 kDa APECED protein is present in the form of nuclear dots. By double immuno-fluorescence labelling we further show that these APECED-containing structures and the previously described PML nuclear bodies are largely non-overlapping. The AIRE protein was also visualized in multiple human tissues: a subset of the cells in thymus, in spleen and in lymph node showed nuclear staining with APECED antiserum. Immunofluorescence labelling of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes also revealed a nuclear body-like staining pattern in a fraction of these cells. These data from both in vitro and ex vivo systems, together with the predicted structural features of the APECED protein, suggest that this protein is most probably involved in the regulation of gene expression.","['Bjorses, P', 'Pelto-Huikko, M', 'Kaukonen, J', 'Aaltonen, J', 'Peltonen, L', 'Ulmanen, I']","['Bjorses P', 'Pelto-Huikko M', 'Kaukonen J', 'Aaltonen J', 'Peltonen L', 'Ulmanen I']","['Department of Human Molecular Genetics, National Public Health Institute and Department of Medical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Mannerheimintie 166, FIN-00300 Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (APECED protein)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['ddc038 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/8.2.259 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1999 Feb;8(2):259-66. doi: 10.1093/hmg/8.2.259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its effect on reverse transcription and homologous recombination has been studied in vitro under strictly identical experimental conditions. For high enzyme concentrations, NCp7 did not stimulate DNA synthesis. The time-course for completion of reverse transcription as well as the processivity and the pattern of pausing were similar in the presence or absence of NCp7. However, the addition of NCp7 significantly affected the yield of the reaction, a decrease exacerbated as the length of the copied RNA increased. We attribute this phenomenon to a destabilization of the RNA/DNA duplex at intermediate stages of reverse transcription.In contrast, NCp7 enhanced homologous recombination during synthesis mediated by HIV-1 RT (reverse transcriptase), as it did for Moloney murine leukemia virus RT. On naked RNA the process of recombination was dependent on the concentration of RT, suggesting that binding of RT to an intermediate of strand transfer was the limiting step. This dependence was relieved in the presence of NCp7. This effect does not imply a direct interaction between RT and NCp7, since similar results were obtained when NCp7 was substituted by the bacterial RNA chaperon StpA. The dominant effect of NCp7 is therefore most probably exerted at the level of condensation of the RNA templates, leading to the formation of productive interactions between the nascent DNA and the acceptor template.","['Negroni, M', 'Buc, H']","['Negroni M', 'Buc H']","['Unite de Physicochimie des Macromolecules Biologiques, (URA1773 du CNRS), Paris Cedex 15, 75724, France. matteo@pasteur.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (NCP7 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Capsid/*physiology', '*Capsid Proteins', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/*physiology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', '*Viral Proteins', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,1999/02/05 00:00,1999/02/05 00:01,['1999/02/05 00:00'],"['1999/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(98)92460-3 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1998.2460 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1999 Feb 12;286(1):15-31. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1998.2460.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

THP1, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, was differentiated to macrophages by adding of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 hours. The intracellular production of peroxide was measured by a cytofluorometric assay with 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate with a flow cytometer scan. Peroxide was detected in monocytes and upregulated during the transformation to macrophages by 3.18+/-0.52 times in relative fluorescein of peak value (P<0.01). Angiotensin II (1 micromol/L) induced oxidative stress in macrophages, with the peak at 15 minutes by 451+/-223%, and returned to the control level within 1 hour. EC50 was 5.4x10(-9) mol/L. AT1 antagonist (CV11974, 1 micromol/L) significantly decreased angiotensin II-induced oxidative stress in macrophages, but AT2 antagonist (PD123319, 1 micromol/L) did not. Of interest, AT1 antagonist also decreased basal levels of peroxide production in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that upregulation of the expression of AT1 receptor in macrophages contributes in part to upregulation of peroxide production. AT1 receptor antagonists may be useful to suppress oxidative stress of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions.","['Yanagitani, Y', 'Rakugi, H', 'Okamura, A', 'Moriguchi, K', 'Takiuchi, S', 'Ohishi, M', 'Suzuki, K', 'Higaki, J', 'Ogihara, T']","['Yanagitani Y', 'Rakugi H', 'Okamura A', 'Moriguchi K', 'Takiuchi S', 'Ohishi M', 'Suzuki K', 'Higaki J', 'Ogihara T']","['Department of Geriatric Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,"['0 (Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1)', '0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2)', '0 (Receptors, Angiotensin)', '0 (Tetrazoles)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '130663-39-7 (PD 123319)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S8Q36MD2XX (candesartan)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II/pharmacology', 'Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology', 'Peroxides/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2', 'Receptors, Angiotensin/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tetrazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/04 00:00,1999/02/04 00:01,['1999/02/04 00:00'],"['1999/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.hyp.33.1.335 [doi]'],ppublish,Hypertension. 1999 Jan;33(1 Pt 2):335-9. doi: 10.1161/01.hyp.33.1.335.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a transient retroviral gene transduction system 'STITCH' was developed comprising pSTITCH retroviral vector encoding the transgene, plasmids encoding Moloney murine leukemia virus gag/pol and gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope, and the human kidney cell line 293T as a packaging line. Cotransfection of retroviral vector and packaging plasmids in 293T cells results in the production of GALV env pseudotyped viral particles with a titer of 10(7) infectious units per milliliter. The 'STITCH' gene transduction system efficiently transduces genes into activated human T lymphocytes derived from healthy donors and cancer patients. The efficacy of gene transduction is donor-independent. A direct application of the 'STITCH' gene transduction system is the genetic engineering of activated human T lymphocytes to induce expression of antibody based chimeric receptors in their membrane. Introduction of these chimeric receptors into activated human T lymphocytes graft these cells with specificity for, for example, renal cell carcinoma. In order to study the effect of the chimeric receptor gene structure on the processes ultimately leading to functional membrane expression, we designed a number of different chimeric receptor gene structures and subsequently compared their membrane expression on 293T cells and activated human T lymphocytes. Distinct membrane expression densities were observed on 293T cells and human T lymphocytes for the different chimeric receptor gene constructs. Gene transduction of activated human T lymphocytes with four out of five chimeric receptor gene constructs resulted in functional expression of chimeric receptor as demonstrated by specific recognition and cytolysis of renal cell carcinoma.","['Weijtens, M E', 'Willemsen, R A', 'Hart, E H', 'Bolhuis, R L']","['Weijtens ME', 'Willemsen RA', 'Hart EH', 'Bolhuis RL']","['Department of Clinical and Tumor Immunology, Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Renal Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/04 00:00,1999/02/04 00:01,['1999/02/04 00:00'],"['1999/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300696 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1998 Sep;5(9):1195-203. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300696.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with T-LGL leukaemia were identified from a consecutive series of Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The diagnosis of T-LGL leukaemia was based on typical morphological and immunophenotypical features, and confirmed by the detection of clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangement. The clinicopathological features, response to treatment, and long term follow up were also examined. RESULTS: Five patients were identified as having T-LGL leukaemia from a consecutive series of 33 Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The median follow up time was 45 months. An obvious lymphocytosis was present in only two cases, although an increase in large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was found in four. In one case, the LGL count was within the normal range. Epstein-Barr virus encoded early nuclear RNA was negative in all the cases. There was no evidence of rheumatoid arthritis, and none of the patients presented with recurrent infections. On follow up, pure red cell aplasia occurred at some stage of the disease in all the patients. This responded to treatment with cyclosporin A in two and with antithymocyte globulin in one. Two patients remained transfusion dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to Western patients, Chinese patients with T-LGL leukaemia do not appear to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent infections, but pure red cell aplasia is a major cause of morbidity in this ethnic group.","['Kwong, Y L', 'Wong, K F']","['Kwong YL', 'Wong KF']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*complications/ethnology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*etiology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/02/04 00:00,1999/02/04 00:01,['1999/02/04 00:00'],"['1999/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.51.9.672 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1998 Sep;51(9):672-5. doi: 10.1136/jcp.51.9.672.,,PMC500904,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of secondary leukemia in a population-based cohort of 28,971 women in North America and Europe who had received a diagnosis of invasive ovarian cancer between 1980 and 1993. Leukemia developed after the administration of platinum-based therapy in 96 women. These women were matched to 272 control patients. The type, cumulative dose, and duration of chemotherapy and the dose of radiation delivered to active bone marrow were compared in the two groups. RESULTS: Among the women who received platinum-based combination chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, the relative risk of leukemia was 4.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 11.4). The relative risks for treatment with carboplatin and for treatment with cisplatin were 6.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 36.6) and 3.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 9.4), respectively. We found evidence of a dose-response relation, with relative risks reaching 7.6 at doses of 1000 mg or more of platinum (P for trend <0.001). Radiotherapy without chemotherapy (median dose, 18.4 Gy) did not increase the risk of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Platinum-based treatment of ovarian cancer increases the risk of secondary leukemia. Nevertheless, the substantial benefit that platinum-based treatment offers patients with advanced disease outweighs the relatively small excess risk of leukemia.","['Travis, L B', 'Holowaty, E J', 'Bergfeldt, K', 'Lynch, C F', 'Kohler, B A', 'Wiklund, T', 'Curtis, R E', 'Hall, P', 'Andersson, M', 'Pukkala, E', 'Sturgeon, J', 'Stovall, M']","['Travis LB', 'Holowaty EJ', 'Bergfeldt K', 'Lynch CF', 'Kohler BA', 'Wiklund T', 'Curtis RE', 'Hall P', 'Andersson M', 'Pukkala E', 'Sturgeon J', 'Stovall M']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'Carboplatin/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cisplatin/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/radiotherapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,1999/02/04 00:00,1999/02/04 00:01,['1999/02/04 00:00'],"['1999/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199902043400504 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1999 Feb 4;340(5):351-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199902043400504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, sTfR levels were higher in LFSS than in HFSS patients. Erythropoietin (Epo) levels were increased in the plasma of LFSS individuals (range = 34-215 ml U/ml), while the values in HFSS patients were in the normal range (3-20 ml U/ml). Furthermore, we identify here stem cell factor (SCF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as regulatory factors specifically affected by the presence of SS genotype and its level of severity. The plasma concentrations of SCF and TGF-beta were increased compared with normal controls and high levels of SCF (up to 7,000 pg/ml) were detected in LFSS patients. The latter also showed increased proportion of SCF+ CD34 enriched circulating cells (49%). Low SCF in HFSS patients is associated with elevated TGF-beta, suggesting a regulatory role of the latter on either SCF release or c-kit expression in progenitor cells. Occasional elevation of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin (IL)-7, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha in plasma of SS patients is not specific because no relation to HbF could be demonstrated. All plasma tested for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were negative. Data presented here, complementing previously published information, supports a model in which HFSS patients achieve a balance between inhibitory (TGF-beta) and stimulatory (SCF, IL-3) factors, resulting in moderate erythropoietic response. In contrast, in LFSS patients, low levels of TGF-beta and the increased release of GM-CSF and SCF maintain the intense erythropoiesis in response to higher erythropoietic stress, in these more severe patients.","['Croizat, H', 'Nagel, R L']","['Croizat H', 'Nagel RL']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*blood', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry/immunology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/blood', 'Interleukin-7/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Transferrin/blood', 'Solubility', 'Stem Cell Factor/blood', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood']",,1999/02/03 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/03 03:03'],"['1999/02/03 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/03 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199902)60:2<105::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199902)60:2<105::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Feb;60(2):105-15. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199902)60:2<105::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-z.,"['HL38655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In occasional cases of Richter's transformation, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been identified in the lymphoma cells. To evaluate the association of EBV infection with Richter's syndrome, the biopsy specimens and clinical records of 25 patients who were seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1984-1996 were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of EBV by immunoperoxidase staining for expression of EBV latent membrane protein (LMP), as well as the expression of EBV RNA and DNA in the cells by in situ hybridization. Four of the 25 patients showed evidence of EBV in the diffuse large cell lymphoma cells-three patients with a B-cell phenotype were positive for LMP, EBV DNA, and RNA; and one patient with a T-cell phenotype had positive EBV RNA in the large cell lymphoma cells. The Richter's syndrome was treated with combination chemotherapy in 15 patients, three received radiotherapy, three were followed without further therapy after a splenectomy, two died before treatment could be started, and one patient had insufficient follow-up. One patient with evidence of EBV in large cell lymphoma cells was treated with acyclovir as initial therapy. The median survival of EBV-positive patients was three months compared with nine months for EBV-negative patients, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.385). Evidence for EBV infection related to Richter's transformation was present in 16% of the patients in this study and may be associated with a poorer outcome. Primary therapy with acyclovir in one patient did not seem to be beneficial and other therapeutic modalities in patients with EBV-positive Richter's transformation need to be explored.","['Ansell, S M', 'Li, C Y', 'Lloyd, R V', 'Phyliky, R L']","['Ansell SM', 'Li CY', 'Lloyd RV', 'Phyliky RL']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/virology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/etiology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/analysis']",,1999/02/03 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/03 03:03'],"['1999/02/03 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/03 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199902)60:2<99::AID-AJH3>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199902)60:2<99::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-t [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Feb;60(2):99-104. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199902)60:2<99::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-three patients treated between February 1992 and February 1996 were included in this study. Eighteen patients were treated with ATRA alone and 25 patients were treated with ATRA followed by chemotherapy. The cytogenetic analysis was done in 41 patients at presentation, following treatment, and at follow-up. A complete response (CR) was achieved in 13 (72%) patients on ATRA and 19 (76%) on ATRA followed by chemotherapy. Eleven of 13 patients with response to ATRA alone relapsed with median survival of eight months (range, 1 to 28). One patient died of hepatitis in CR and one patient is alive 2 years after diagnosis. In the combination therapy arm, 10 patients are in CR with a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 6 to 56 months). After achieving a CR, four patients died due to infections during chemotherapy therapy, and only 5 of 19 patients have relapsed. Major cytogenetic response was seen in 8 of the 10 patients in whom cytogenetic data was available after treatment with ATRA at the time of remission. Similarly, 13 of 15 for whom data was available showed a major cytogenetic response after treatment with ATRA plus chemotherapy. Prior to relapse, 80% of the patients had an increase in the percentage of t(15;17) cells in the marrow. Patients with a complete hematological response but no cytogenetic response relapsed within six months. Ten patients died prior to response evaluation. Two patients who received ATRA died of retinoic acid syndrome, one of pneumonia, and one of intracranial hemorrhage. Of the six patients on ATRA and chemotherapy, four died of retinoic acid syndrome (RAS), one of intracranial hemorrhage, and one of left ventricular failure. Only one patient is alive at 24 months following treatment with ATRA alone. The relapse-free survival is 42% at four years for patients treated with ATRA followed by chemotherapy. This trial is a historical comparison of ATRA alone and ATRA with subsequent combination chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the trial shows a significant improvement in the event free survival of patients receiving chemotherapy as consolidation following ATRA.","['Advani, S H', 'Nair, R', 'Bapna, A', 'Gladstone, B', 'Kadam, P', 'Saikia, T K', 'Parekh, P M', 'Gopal, R', 'Nair, C N']","['Advani SH', 'Nair R', 'Bapna A', 'Gladstone B', 'Kadam P', 'Saikia TK', 'Parekh PM', 'Gopal R', 'Nair CN']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Weight Gain']",,1999/02/03 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/02/03 03:03'],"['1999/02/03 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/02/03 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199902)60:2<87::AID-AJH1>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199902)60:2<87::aid-ajh1>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Feb;60(2):87-93. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199902)60:2<87::aid-ajh1>3.0.co;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following integration into the host cell genome, HTLV-I replication is regulated by both host and viral mechanisms that control transcription. Low levels of viral transcription (basal transcription) occur before expression of the virally encoded Tax protein (Tax-mediated transcription). Members of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding (CREB)/activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) family of transcription factors bind three 21-bp repeats (Tax-responsive element-1, or TRE-1) within the viral promoter and are important for basal and Tax-mediated transcription. Using mitogen stimulated and quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Jurkat cells, we compared differences in basal transcription and amounts and binding of transcription factors with TRE-1. We demonstrate that amounts of transcriptionally active phosphorylated CREB protein (P-CREB) differ between activated PBMC and Jurkat cells. Following stimulation, P-CREB levels remain elevated in PBMC for up to 24 hours whereas CREB is dephosphorylated in Jurkat cells within 4 hours following stimulation. The differences in P-CREB levels between PBMC and Jurkat cells were directly correlated with basal transcription of HTLV-I in the two cell types. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we determined that the pattern of band migration differed between the two cell types. These data demonstrate that PBMC differentially regulate basal HTLV-I transcription compared with Jurkat T cells, and this differential regulation is due, in part to differential phosphorylation and binding of CREB/ATF-1 to TRE-1 in the HTLV-I promoter. We demonstrate the utility of using primary lymphocyte models to study HTLV-I transcription in the context of cell signaling and suggest that activated PBMC maintain elevated levels of P-CREB, which promote basal HTLV-I transcription and enhance viral persistence in vivo.","['Newbound, G C', ""O'Rourke, J P"", 'Collins, N D', 'DeWille, J', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Newbound GC', ""O'Rourke JP"", 'Collins ND', 'DeWille J', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1092, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,1999/02/03 00:00,1999/02/03 00:01,['1999/02/03 00:00'],"['1999/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199901010-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1999 Jan 1;20(1):1-10. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199901010-00001.,"['AI 01474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The target gene(s) of MLL is unknown at present, but because of its homology to the trithorax gene in Drosophila as well as experimental data from mice, it appears to be involved in maintaining the function of some of the homeobox genes.

Relative to extract from untreated cells, GATA-1 binding activity increased markedly in all cases. However, immunoblot analysis revealed unchanged levels of GATA-1 protein after induction. Incubation of induced but not uninduced K562 extracts with phosphatase prior to EMSA weakened the binding activity, suggesting that the increase in GATA-1 binding following induction of K562 cells was a consequence of phosphorylation. When the mouse erythroleukaemic cell line MEL was induced with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), NaB or NAC, GATA-1 binding activity fell with DMSO, rose significantly with NaB and remained at about the same level in NAC-induced cells. In this case immunoblotting revealed that GATA-1 protein levels were in accord with the EMSA data. The DNA-binding activities of induced and uninduced MEL cell nuclear extracts were decreased by incubation with phosphatase, showing that phosphoryl-ation and DNA binding of GATA-1 are already optimalin these cells. The DNA-binding activity of affinity-purified GATA-1 from MEL cells was also reduced by phosphatase treatment, showing that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is directly affecting the factor. Furthermore, when a comparison was made by EMSA of nuclear extracts prepared from K562 and MEL cells untreated or incubated with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, GATA-1 binding was seen to increase with K562 cells, whereas with MEL cells there was no change in GATA-1 binding. Overall the results suggest that the level of GATA-1 phosphorylation increases after the induction of K562, but not MEL cells, where GATA-1 is already highly phosphorylated. Furthermore, phosphorylation increases the binding affinity of GATA-1 for a canonical binding site.","['Partington, G A', 'Patient, R K']","['Partington GA', 'Patient RK']","[""Developmental Biology Research Centre, School of Biomedical Sciences, The Randall Institute, King's College London, 26-29 Drury Lane, London WC2B 5RL, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,1999/02/03 00:00,1999/02/03 00:01,['1999/02/03 00:00'],"['1999/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['gkc194 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/27.4.1168 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Feb 15;27(4):1168-75. doi: 10.1093/nar/27.4.1168.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],PMC148299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with this hypothesis, the susceptibility of some wild mice to X-MLVs has been mapped to the P-MLV receptor locus at the distal end of mouse chromosome 1. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA for the human X-MLV cell surface receptor (X-receptor) by using a human T lymphocyte cDNA library in a retroviral vector. The predicted X-receptor contains 696 amino acids with multiple hydrophobic potential membrane-spanning sequences and with weak homologies to the yeast proteins SYG1, of unknown function, and PHO81, which has been implicated in a system that regulates transport of inorganic phosphate. Expression of the X-receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which are substantially resistant to P-MLVs and to X-MLVs, made them susceptible to both of these virus groups. The mouse homologue of the X-receptor was mapped by hybridization to the distal end of chromosome 1 at the same position as the P-MLV receptor gene Rmc1. These results strongly support the hypothesis that a common gene encodes the receptors for X-MLVs and P-MLVs, with the human X-receptor preferentially mediating X-MLV infections and the homologous protein of inbred mice mediating only P-MLV infections. We propose that X-MLVs and P-MLVs comprise a single family of retroviruses that have coevolved in response to diversification in X-receptor genes of the host.","['Tailor, C S', 'Nouri, A', 'Lee, C G', 'Kozak, C', 'Kabat, D']","['Tailor CS', 'Nouri A', 'Lee CG', 'Kozak C', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201-3098, USA. tailorc@ohsh.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Asia', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",,1999/02/03 00:00,1999/02/03 00:01,['1999/02/03 00:00'],"['1999/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.3.927 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Feb 2;96(3):927-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.3.927.,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC15327,['GENBANK/AF089744'],,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Feb 2;96(3):802-4.

This is the case with anthracyclines such as daunomycin and also with indolocarbazoles including the antibiotic rebeccamycin and its tumor active analog, NB506. In each case, the glycoside residue plays a significant role in the interaction of the drug with the DNA double helix. In this study we show that the DNA-binding affinity and sequence selectivity of a rebeccamycin derivative can be enhanced by replacing the glucose residue with a 2'-aminoglucose moiety. The drug-DNA interactions were studied by thermal denaturation, fluorescence, and footprinting experiments. The thermodynamic parameters indicate that the newly introduced amino group on the glycoside residue significantly enhanced binding to DNA by increasing the contribution of the polyelectrolyte effect to the binding free energy, but does not appear to participate in any specific molecular contacts. The energetic contribution of the amino group of the rebeccamycin analog was found to be weaker than that of the sugar amino group of daunomycin, possibly because the indolocarbazole derivative is only partially charged at neutral pH. Topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage studies reveal that the OH-->NH2 substitution does not affect the capacity of the drug to stabilize enzyme-DNA covalent complexes. Cytotoxicity studies with P388 leukemia cells sensitive or resistant to camptothecin suggest that topoisomerase I represents a privileged intracellular target for the studied compounds. The role of the sugar amino group is discussed. The study provides useful guidelines for the development of a new generation of indolocarbazole-based antitumor agents.","['Bailly, C', 'Qu, X', 'Anizon, F', 'Prudhomme, M', 'Riou, J F', 'Chaires, J B']","['Bailly C', 'Qu X', 'Anizon F', 'Prudhomme M', 'Riou JF', 'Chaires JB']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret et Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U-124, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Amino Sugars)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (NB 506)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '93908-02-2 (rebeccamycin)']",IM,"['Amino Sugars/*chemistry', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carbazoles/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glucosides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Indoles', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",,1999/02/03 00:00,1999/02/03 00:01,['1999/02/03 00:00'],"['1999/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.55.2.377 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1999 Feb;55(2):377-85. doi: 10.1124/mol.55.2.377.,['CA35635/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In monolayer cultures of murine PGC, stem cell factor (SCF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) independently promote survival in vitro; however, the relevance of these data to fetal ovarian oogonium and oocyte survival, as well as the intracellular events involved in transducing the antiapoptotic actions of these cytokines in germ cells, remain to be elucidated. In this report, we investigated the effects of SCF and LIF, alone and in combination, on the survival of oogonia and oocytes, and elaborated on components of the signal transduction pathway used by these molecules, after validating a method of culturing fetal mouse ovaries. We further employed this system to also test the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a classic antiapoptotic molecule, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a classic pro-apoptotic molecule, interact with the SCF/LIF pathway and function in a reciprocal fashion to precisely regulate germ cell numbers during fetal oogenesis. Freshly isolated embryonic day 13.5 ovaries contained nonapoptotic germ cells, as determined by histologic analysis of cellular morphology and in situ 3'-end-labeling of DNA integrity. In vitro culture of fetal ovaries without tropic support for 24, 48, and 72 h resulted in a time-dependent induction of germ cell apoptosis, such that most oogonia and oocytes present after 72 h were apoptotic. Morphometric analysis of serially sectioned ovaries indicated that the numbers of nonapoptotic germ cells remaining after 24, 48, and 72 h of culture were 78%, 38%, and 10%, respectively, of the number present before culture (P < 0.05 for all time points vs. 0 h). Inclusion of SCF (100 ng/ml) together with LIF (100 ng/ml) in the culture medium significantly attenuated germ cell apoptosis, with the SCF/LIF-treated ovaries retaining 5.5-fold more oogonia and oocytes after 72 h of culture as compared with control ovaries deprived of tropic support (P < 0.05). However, SCF or LIF, when added separately, had no (SCF) or little (LIF) inhibitory effect on germ cell apoptosis. Provision of 50 ng/ml IGF-I maintained survival of approximately two-thirds of the germ cells in cultured ovaries (P < 0.05), whereas a combination of all three growth factors (SCF, LIF, IGF-I) completely preserved the fetal ovary in culture to that resembling a freshly-isolated gonad. Cotreatment with 25 ng/ml TGF-beta partially reversed the survival actions of IGF-I or SCF/LIF, such that only one-third of the starting number of oogonia/oocytes remained after 72 h of culture (P < 0.05). Lastly, the antiapoptotic effects of SCF/LIF or IGF-I were almost entirely eliminated by cotreatment of fetal ovaries with either one of two inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K), LY294002 (5 microM) or wortmannin (50 nM), whereas cotreatment with an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase (rapamycin, 25 ng/ml) was without effect. These data indicate that the combined actions of SCF, LIF, and IGF-I are required for maximal inhibition of apoptosis in germ cells of fetal mouse ovaries, and that the PI3K signaling pathway is an essential component of cytokine-mediated female germ cell survival. Moreover, TGF-beta can partially override the antiapoptotic actions of SCF/LIF or IGF-I in oogonia and oocytes, suggesting the existence of a complex signaling network that ultimately determines fetal ovarian germ cell fate.","['Morita, Y', 'Manganaro, T F', 'Tao, X J', 'Martimbeau, S', 'Donahoe, P K', 'Tilly, J L']","['Morita Y', 'Manganaro TF', 'Tao XJ', 'Martimbeau S', 'Donahoe PK', 'Tilly JL']","['Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Female', 'Fetus/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Ovary/cytology/embryology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.140.2.6539 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1999 Feb;140(2):941-9. doi: 10.1210/endo.140.2.6539.,"['R01-AG12279/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-ES08430/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HD34226/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, two such proteins, PLZF and LAZ-3/BCL-6, have been implicated in oncogenesis. We have now identified a new member of this gene subfamily which encodes a 62 kDa Zn-finger protein, termed LRF, with a BTB/POZ domain highly similar to that of PLZF. Both human and mouse LRF genes, which localized to syntenic chromosomal regions (19p13.3 and 10B5.3, respectively), were widely expressed in adult tissues and cell lines. At approximately 9.5-10.0 days of embryonic development, the mouse LRF gene was expressed in the limb buds, pharyngeal arches, tail bud, placenta and neural tube. The LRF protein associated in vivo with LAZ-3/BCL-6, but not with PLZF to which it was more related. Although the LRF, or LAZ-3/BCL-6, BTB/POZ domain could readily homodimerize, no heterodimerization was detected in vivo between the LRF and LAZ-3/BCL-6 BTB/POZ domains and interaction between full length LRF and LAZ-3/BCL-6 required the presence of both the BTB/POZ domain and Zn-fingers in each partner protein. As expected from the above results, LRF and LAZ-3/BCL-6 also colocalized with each other in the nucleus. Taken together, our findings suggest that BTB/ POZ-domain Zn-finger proteins may function as homo and heterodimeric complexes whose formation, and hence the resultant effect on transcription of their downstream target genes, is determined by the levels and expression domains of a given partner protein.","['Davies, J M', 'Hawe, N', 'Kabarowski, J', 'Huang, Q H', 'Zhu, J', 'Brand, N J', 'Leprince, D', 'Dhordain, P', 'Cook, M', 'Morriss-Kay, G', 'Zelent, A']","['Davies JM', 'Hawe N', 'Kabarowski J', 'Huang QH', 'Zhu J', 'Brand NJ', 'Leprince D', 'Dhordain P', 'Cook M', 'Morriss-Kay G', 'Zelent A']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)', '0 (Zbtb7a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202332 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 14;18(2):365-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202332.,['CA59936-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['GENBANK/AF086830', 'GENBANK/AF086831']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its ability to mimic the proliferative and cell survival functions of hematopoietic growth factors, we hypothesized that the oncogene activated in CML, BCR-ABL, might also influence differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of expressing BCR-ABL on the myeloid differentiation of murine M1 leukemic cells, which cease dividing and differentiate into macrophages in the presence of the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or interleukin (IL)-6. We found that BCR-ABL induced macrophage differentiation in M1 cells, accompanied by increased expression of macrophage cell surface markers and the acquisition of phagocytic ability. interestingly, clones of M1 cells which expressed BCR-ABL remained in cell cycle and were refractory to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by IL-6 or LIF in parental M1 cells.

Using differential display of mRNAs from nontumorigenic infinite life span human fibroblast cell strain MSU-1.1 and an isogenic fibrosarcoma-derived cell line, 6A/SB1, which was derived from chemical carcinogen transformed MSU-1.1 cells, we identified a novel gene, ST7, showing sixfold lower expression in 6A/SB1 cells compared with parental MSU-1.1 cells. Molecular cloning of a near full-length cDNA revealed that the novel gene encodes a putative transmembrane protein composed of 859 amino acids: the 492 N-terminal amino acids including a fivefold cysteine-rich repeat of 40 amino acids homologous to the ligand binding repeat of the known low density lipoprotein receptor, a 24 hydrophobic amino acid stretch spanning the plasma membrane, and a C-terminal domain of 343 residues. ST7 is located on human chromosome 8, band q22.2-23.1, the same locus as the genes involved in acute myeloid leukemia and a locus of high polymorphism in cancer biopsies. The ST7 gene is widely expressed in normal human tissues and is particularly abundant in human heart and skeletal muscle. Northern analysis of 15 tumor cell lines derived from patients and 16 cell lines established from tumors formed in athymic mice by MSU-1.1 cells transformed in culture by various methods showed that 16 of the 31 cell lines have low or undetectable levels of ST7 mRNA. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis using a specific anti-peptide antibody demonstrated that the level of ST7 protein is high in normal fibroblasts and low in 12 sarcoma-derived cell lines tested. Altered expression of ST7 appears to occur at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. These studies are a first step in characterizing a novel putative receptor protein, whose expression is downregulated in some malignantly transformed cells, and which may play an important role in the transformation process of these cells.","['Qing, J', 'Wei, D', 'Maher, V M', 'McCormick, J J']","['Qing J', 'Wei D', 'Maher VM', 'McCormick JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, The Cancer Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1316, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202290 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 14;18(2):335-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202290.,"['AG11026/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/AF166350'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study in detail the patterns of p15INK4B methylation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, we adopted a novel approach based on PCR amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA followed by resolution of differentially methylated sequences by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. This method visually displays the degree and heterogeneity of DNA methylation and enables the isolation and characterization of distinct clonotypic epigenotypes. A surprisingly high degree of intra- and interindividual heterogeneity of p15INK4B methylation was observed in the 65 acute myeloid leukemia patients examined. Methylation was detected in 46 (71%) of the patients and was observed more frequently in the French-American-British subtypes M1/M2 than in M4/M5 (P < 0.025). Examination of the same panel of samples using a highly sensitive methylation-specific PCR method showed methylated p15INK4B alleles in 61 (94%) of the samples.

Here, we demonstrated a pronounced elevation of H2O2 and O2- in human leukemia HL-60 cells treated with beta-Lap. Treatment with other Topo poisons, such as camptothecin (CPT), Vbeta-16, and GL331, did not have the same effect. On the other hand, antioxidant vitamin C (Vit C) treatment effectively antagonized beta-Lap-induced apoptosis. This suggested that a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related pathway was involved in beta-Lap-induced apoptosis program. We also found that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was persistently activated in apoptosis induced by beta-Lap. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1-DN) or treatment with JNK-specific antisense oligonucleotide or Vit C all prevented beta-Lap-induced JNK activation and the subsequent apoptosis. Only the expression of MEKK1-DN, not Vit C treatment, blocked the JNK activity induced by CPT, Vbeta-16, or GL331. These results confirm again that ROS acts as a mediator for JNK activation during beta-Lap-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that beta-Lap can stimulate CPP32/Yama activity, which was, however, markedly inhibited by the MEKK1-DN expression or Vit C treatment. Again, CPT-induced CPP32/Yama activation can be abolished by MEKK1-DN but not by Vit C treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-Lap but not other Topo inhibitors triggers apoptosis signaling, i.e., JNK and subsequent CPP32/Yama activation are mediated by the generation of ROS.","['Shiah, S G', 'Chuang, S E', 'Chau, Y P', 'Shen, S C', 'Kuo, M L']","['Shiah SG', 'Chuang SE', 'Chau YP', 'Shen SC', 'Kuo ML']","['Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '4707-32-8 (beta-lapachone)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jan 15;59(2):391-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data indicate that whilst aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts are seen both in normal and malignant cells, lack of FHIT protein is restricted to leukaemia. Absent FHIT protein expression might contribute to leukaemogenesis.","['Peters, U R', 'Hasse, U', 'Oppliger, E', 'Tschan, M', 'Ong, S T', 'Rassool, F V', 'Borisch, B', 'Tobler, A', 'Fey, M F']","['Peters UR', 'Hasse U', 'Oppliger E', 'Tschan M', 'Ong ST', 'Rassool FV', 'Borisch B', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF']","['Department of Clinical Research, the Institute of Medical Oncology, University and Inselspital, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202256 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jan 7;18(1):79-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202256.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commitment to hemoglobin synthesis in response to a variety of chemical inducers, including hexamethylene bisacetamide and dimethyl sulfoxide is completed by 24 h and proceeds to terminal differentiation by 96 h. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a classical tumor promoter phorbol ester that binds to protein kinase C, blocks differentiation in a reversible manner, suggesting an important role for protein kinase C signaling pathways. The classical protein kinase C isoforms alpha, betaI, and betaII, play distinct roles in the transduction of proliferative and differentiative signals in human, as well as in murine, erythroleukemia cells. Protein kinase Calpha has been implicated in differentiation of human erythroleukemia cells although its translocation to the nucleus has not been observed. Taking advantage of the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to block differentiation in Friend erythroleukemia cells, we determined the localization of the predominant protein kinase C isoforms alpha and betaI during differentiation and in response to their blockade. The ability of phorbol myristate acetate to preferentially diminish protein kinase Calpha-protein localization to the nucleus by 24 h and thereby block differentiation induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide was paralleled by the ability of protein kinase Calpha antisense transfection to block differentiation. In addition, beta-globin transcription, assessed by polymerase chain reaction, was significantly decreased in protein kinase Calpha antisense-transfected cells compared to that seen in vector transfected ones. Taken together, these data suggest an important temporal role for nuclear protein kinase Calpha localization in Friend erythroleukemia cell differentiation.","['Mallia, C M', 'Aguirre, V', 'McGary, E', 'Tang, Y', 'Scandurro, A B', 'Liu, C', 'Noguchi, C T', 'Beckman, B S']","['Mallia CM', 'Aguirre V', 'McGary E', 'Tang Y', 'Scandurro AB', 'Liu C', 'Noguchi CT', 'Beckman BS']","['Department of Pharmacology, Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkca protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94312-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4312 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Feb 1;246(2):348-54. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4312.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to test this hypothesis, the in vitro antitumor activities of these compounds and their [glycyl,glutamyl] diethyl ester prodrug forms (1(Et)2-3(Et)2) have been examined. All three diethyl esters inhibit the growth of L1210 murine leukemia and B16 melanotic melanoma in culture, with GI50 values in the micromolar concentration range. Cell permeability studies with L1210 cells indicate that growth inhibition is associated with rapid diffusion of the diethyl esters into the cells, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the ethyl ester functions to give the inhibitory diacids. In contrast, the corresponding diacids neither readily diffuse into nor significantly inhibit the growth of these cells. Consistent with the hypothesis that cell growth inhibition is due to competitive inhibition of glyoxalase I, preincubation of L1210 cells with 2(Et)2 increases the sensitivity of these cells to the inhibitory effects of exogenous methylglyoxal. Compound 2(Et)2 is much less toxic to nonproliferating murine splenic lymphocytes, possibly reflecting reduced sensitivity to methylglyoxal and/or reduced chemical stability of the diacid inside these cells. Finally, a plasma esterase-deficient murine model has been identified that should allow in vivo testing of the diethyl esters.","['Kavarana, M J', 'Kovaleva, E G', 'Creighton, D J', 'Wollman, M B', 'Eiseman, J L']","['Kavarana MJ', 'Kovaleva EG', 'Creighton DJ', 'Wollman MB', 'Eiseman JL']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/02/02 00:00,1999/02/02 00:01,['1999/02/02 00:00'],"['1999/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm9708036 [doi]', 'jm9708036 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1999 Jan 28;42(2):221-8. doi: 10.1021/jm9708036.,['CA 59612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AA isomers are nearly identical in their physical and chemical properties but differ widely in their biological properties. AA, a lactone sugar, has a number of reactive positions, especially at 2- and 6-. Although there are a number of reports on the cytotoxic effect of AA and its isomers on malignant and nonmalignant cell lines, no work has been reported on the comparative effects of substitutions at these active sites. This study, then, investigates the comparative cytotoxicity of such substitutes on the malignant leukemia P388 cell line in culture. We tested a series of 2-, 6- and 2,6- disubstituted AA-derivatives, comprising the following: i) substitution at 2-position: -PO4, -SO4, O-Me, O-octadecyl; ii) substitution at 6-position: -PO4, -SO4, -palmitate, -stearate; and iii) substitution at 2,6-position: -dipalmitate. About 50,000 P388 cells/ml were incubated with and without AA derivatives in a final concentration of 1000, 500, 100, 10 and 1 microg/ml in triplicate and counted after 72 hrs. All 2-substituted and the 2,6-substituted AA derivatives tested were nontoxic and ineffective in preventing cell growth. In contrast, all 6-substituted AA derivatives were very toxic at all levels, even at the lowest concentration. These results suggest that substitution at 2-, 6- and 2,6-positions in AA have a different effect on toxicity. The 2-, and 2,6-substituted AA derivatives are stable compounds, resistant to hydrolysis which render them inactive. The cytotoxicity of the 6-substituted derivatives may be explained by one of the following mechanisms, yet to be explored: i) the hydrolysis rate may differ; or ii) the chemical structure itself may affect toxicity. Further studies are in progress to understand the mechanism.","['Roomi, M W', 'House, D', 'Tsao, C S']","['Roomi MW', 'House D', 'Tsao CS']","['Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis 97331, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/30 00:00,1999/01/30 00:01,['1999/01/30 00:00'],"['1999/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1998 Nov;16(4):295-300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 1994, 136 patients, 82 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 54 with acute leukemia (AL), received a uniform preparatory regimen of fractionated total body irradiation (TBI; 12 Gy in 3 days) plus different chemotherapy regimens before bone marrow transplantation. Eighty-six patients were considered to be in early phase of disease (CML in chronic phase or AL in first complete remission) and 50 in advanced phase (all those beyond first remission or first chronic phase). Ninety-five patients received unmanipulated allogeneic BM, and 41 T-lymphocyte-depleted BM. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the whole series were 43% and 31%, and median survival was 43 and 10 months, respectively. A Cox proportional hazard model identified variables related to overall and disease-free survival. For OS, graft versus host disease (GVHD) was the first independent variable (P < 0.0001), followed by age (P < 0.001), T-depletion (P < 0.01), disease status (P < 0.05) and type of leukemia (P < 0.05). With regard to DFS, only T-depletion (P < 0.0001), disease status (P < 0.01) and GVHD (P < 0.01) resulted predictor factors. Early complications after BMT were reported in 59 patients, TBI-induced delayed toxicity in 9 patients, and 16 patients suffered late complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the curability of early phase leukemias with standard fractionated TBI-induced Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT).

Over a course of 5 years, we followed a case of B-CLL which aberrantly expressed the CD8 molecule. During this period, the clinical and hematological conditions of the patient were stable. This B-CLL presented a typical immunophenotype (HLA DR+, CD19+, CD5+, CD23+) with monotypic expression of surface immunoglobulin light chain kappa. We confirmed the CD8 expression on these leukemia cells by using double labelling and different antibodies directed against this antigen. We measured the quantitative expression of the CD8 molecule. The number of CD8 molecules per cell was clearly lower on these malignant B cells than on normal T lymphocytes. In order to evaluate the prognostic significance of this CD8 expression, we quantitated in parallel other markers such as CD5, CD23, CD22, CD11c. During 5 years, this aberrant CD8 expression persisted and was associated with an increase of the CD23 and a decrease of CD22 levels, known to correlate with a good prognosis in agreement with the karyotype analysis.

To identify target antigens for the GvL response on leukemia cells, we looked for polymorphism of proteinase 3, a primary granule protein overexpressed in myeloid leukemias. The study was carried out in 10 patients with hematologic diseases and their HLA-identical marrow donors. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism assay, followed by direct sequencing of the PCR products, we found seven DNA polymorphisms. One of them encodes for either an isoleucine or a valine at position 119 of the amino acid sequence. Peptides that span the polymorphic site, at amino acids 115-124, were shown to bind in vitro to the HLA-A2 molecule. We screened 23 HLA-A2 patients with myeloid leukemia and their HLA-identical donors for this polymorphism. No relapse was found in the group of 4 evaluable patients who possessed at least one allele absent in their donor, whereas 7 of the 15 remaining evaluable patients relapsed.

Whether the tumour cells are of B- or T-cell type is an important criterion for prognosis which has not been available previously to pathologists, due to the lack of a reliable early B-cell marker functioning on routinely processed material. This has changed with the production of monoclonal antibodies against the B-cell signalling molecule CD79a. CD79a is expressed on normal and neoplastic B cells from the early stages of B-cell maturation and has been considered to be B-cell-specific. Currently available antibodies against CD79a, in particular JCB117, allow the identification of B cells, and hence B lymphoblastic disease, in paraffin-embedded material. In this study, the expression of CD79a (JCB117) and CD3 has been investigated in 149 cases of T and 68 cases of B lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma. For the first time, co-expression of CD79a (JCB117) and CD3 is reported in 10 per cent of cases of T lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma.

Uterine expression of LIF and that of its receptors has been demonstrated in a number of mammalian species indicating that LIF may have widespread importance in the establishment of pregnancy. The variations in the reaction of the uterus in preparation for and during implantation are considerable between species and understanding the differences and similarities assists in the interpretation of how this cytokine functions. Recent studies suggest that reduced endometrial LIF contributes to human infertility. Studies also demonstrate a potential role in placentation and fetal development. Thus, LIF has become an important cytokine warranting further investigation in the human.

This oncoprotein expresses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that is crucial for its cellular transforming activity. In this study, we evaluated the antineoplastic activity of CGP57148B, which is a competitive inhibitor of the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase. METHODS: Nude mice were given an injection of the Bcr/Abl-positive human leukemia cell lines KU812 or MC3. Tumor-bearing mice were treated intraperitoneally or orally with CGP57148B according to three different schedules. In vitro drug wash-out experiments and in vivo molecular pharmacokinetic experiments were performed to optimize the in vivo treatment schedule. RESULTS: Treatment schedules administering CGP57148B once or twice per day produced some inhibition of tumor growth, but no tumor-bearing mouse was cured. A single administration of CGP57148B caused substantial (>50%) but short-lived (2-5 hours) inhibition of Bcr/Abl kinase activity. On the basis of the results from in vitro wash-out experiments, 20-21 hours was defined as the duration of continuous exposure needed to block cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis in these two leukemia cell lines. A treatment regimen assuring the continuous block of the Bcr/Abl phosphorylating activity that was administered over an 11-day period cured 87%-100% of treated mice. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the continuous block of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase of Bcr/Abl protein is needed to produce important biologic effects in vivo.","['le Coutre, P', 'Mologni, L', 'Cleris, L', 'Marchesi, E', 'Buchdunger, E', 'Giardini, R', 'Formelli, F', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C']","['le Coutre P', 'Mologni L', 'Cleris L', 'Marchesi E', 'Buchdunger E', 'Giardini R', 'Formelli F', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/29 00:00,1999/01/29 00:01,['1999/01/29 00:00'],"['1999/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/91.2.163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Jan 20;91(2):163-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.2.163.,,,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Jan 20;91(2):102-3.

As such, it may have clinical potential by sequestering IL-1, thereby preventing it from binding to its membrane-bound receptor and eliciting a biological effect. As IL-1 has been shown to regulate leukemic cell proliferation in an autocrine fashion, a phase I trial of rhu IL-1R was conducted in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The study group comprised 11 patients who were sequentially treated on one of three dose levels, receiving a single intravenous (i.v.) bolus dose on day 1 followed by 13 days of daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections with the option of an additional 14 days of treatment if a response of stable disease or better was achieved. Dose level 1 i.v. bolus 500 microg/m2, s.c. dose 250 microg/m2 per day (five patients); dose level 2 i.v. bolus 1000 microg/m2, s.c. dose 500 microg/m2 per day (three patients); dose level 3 i.v. bolus 2000 microg/m2, s.c. dose 1000 microg/m2 per day (three patients). Owing to limited drug availability, the study was designed to only examine these three dose levels. RESULTS: rhu IL-IR was well tolerated. There was no grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity related to the study drug and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. No IL-1R-blocking antibodies developed during the course of the study. Serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF were undetectable before, during and after rhu IL-IR administration. The terminal half-life after i.v. dosing was at least 7-12 h, and after s.c. dosing 2-4 days.

L1210 murine leukemia model. In this study, several oxaliplatin derivatives of the general formula trans-(carboxylato)chloro(1R,2R-cyclohexanediamine)(oxala to)platinum(IV) were synthesized in order to find new derivatives with greater oral activity than C5-OHP in a clinically predictive tumor model. In the formula, the carboxylate and chloride ligands are situated in axial positions. METHOD: Four complexes with the axial carboxylate ligands n-butyrate, n-valerate, n-caproate or n-heptanoate were synthesized and designated C4-OHP-Cl, C5-OHP-Cl, C6-OHP-Cl and C7-OHP-Cl, respectively. The oral antitumor activity of the complexes was evaluated against the murine reticulosarcoma M5076 implanted subcutaneoulsy (s.c.) in to male BDF1 mice. The complexes were administered orally daily for 5 days in two cycles initiated on days 5 and 12 postimplantation. The physicochemical properties were examined by measuring the concentrations of the complexes in test solutions at intervals by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic behaviors of C5-OHP-Cl, C6-OHP-Cl and C5-OHP following a single oral administration were studied in non-tumor-bearing male BDFl mice. RESULTS: Of the complexes synthesized in this study, C5-OHP-Cl, which exhibited high activity in the i.p. L1210 model, was found to be orally active in the s.c. M5076 model while C5-OHP was not. The in vitro reduction of the complexes by ascorbate was much more rapid than that of C5-OHP, while the complexes were more stable than C5-OHP in HCl-acidic and alkaline solutions. Pharmacokinetic study showed that Cmax and AUC0 24h values of plasma total and filterable platinum of C5-OHP-Cl were four to six times greater than those of C5-OHP, indicating that C5-OHP-Cl was absorbed more than C5-OHP. CONCLUSION: C5-OHP-Cl was found to be a superior 1-OHP derivative C5-OHP, exhibiting significant oral antitumor activity in the s.c. M5076 model. The enhanced activity of C5-OHP-Cl was considered to be due in part to increased susceptibility to reduction and increased gastrointestinal absorption. C5-OHP-Cl is a suitable candidate for further study as an oral cancer chemotherapy agent.","['Kizu, R', 'Nakanishi, T', 'Hayakawa, K', 'Matsuzawa, A', 'Eriguchi, M', 'Takeda, Y', 'Akiyama, N', 'Tashiro, T', 'Kidani, Y']","['Kizu R', 'Nakanishi T', 'Hayakawa K', 'Matsuzawa A', 'Eriguchi M', 'Takeda Y', 'Akiyama N', 'Tashiro T', 'Kidani Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (bis(butyrato)(1,2-cyclohexanediamine)(oxalato)platinum(IV))', '0 (bis(caproato)(1,2-cyclohexanediamine)(oxalato)platinum(IV))', '0 (bis(heptanato)(1,2-cyclohexanediamine)(oxalato)platinum(IV))', '0 (bis-valerato-oxalato-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",,1999/01/29 00:00,1999/01/29 00:01,['1999/01/29 00:00'],"['1999/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050869 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1999;43(2):97-105. doi: 10.1007/s002800050869.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our review of the literature revealed only 11 biopsy-proved cases in which the 2 reactive dermatoses occurred together. None were associated with an underlying malignant neoplasm. OBSERVATIONS: We report a biopsy-proved case of SS and EN occurring simultaneously in a patient with an underlying malignant neoplasm (specifically, acute myelogenous leukemia). We also report another biopsy-proved case of SS and EN occurring simultaneously in a patient with underlying Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous occurrence of SS and EN in 1 patient is rarely reported. Both disorders are reactive dermatoses that share many overlapping features. Although individually distinctive, SS and EN are also part of a growing continuum of reactive dermatoses. Our expanded understanding of the similarities and simultaneous manifestation of SS and EN may help us in the future to identify a common underlying mechanism of pathogenesis.","['Waltz, K M', 'Long, D', 'Marks, J G Jr', 'Billingsley, E M']","['Waltz KM', 'Long D', 'Marks JG Jr', 'Billingsley EM']","['Department of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, the Milton S.

Catalase activity of HP100 cells was much higher than that of HL-60 cells. Duocarmycin A-mediated DNA ladder formation in HP100 cells was delayed compared with that in HL-60 cells, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 in duocarmycin A-induced apoptosis. Flow cytometry demonstrated that peroxide formation preceded loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) in cells treated with duocarmycin A. Then, caspase-3 was activated, followed by DNA ladder formation. These findings suggest that DNA damage by duocarmycin A induces H2O2 generation, which causes delta psi m loss and subsequently caspase-3 activation, resulting in apoptosis.","['Tada-Oikawa, S', 'Oikawa, S', 'Kawanishi, M', 'Yamada, M', 'Kawanishi, S']","['Tada-Oikawa S', 'Oikawa S', 'Kawanishi M', 'Yamada M', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Hygiene, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'PJV9990868 (duocarmycin A)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Alkylation', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Duocarmycins', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Indoles', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology']",,1999/01/29 00:00,1999/01/29 00:01,['1999/01/29 00:00'],"['1999/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(98)01618-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01618-4 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Jan 8;442(1):65-9. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01618-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with the parent HL60 cells, the HL60/DOX cells were 13.0-fold more resistant to DOX and showed multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype characterized by 4.6-fold, 2.3-fold, and 5.7-fold cross-resistance to vincristine, pirarubicin, and etoposide, respectively, but no cross-resistance to alkylating agent, cisplatin. Immunocytochemical analyses using the specific monoclonal antibody, MRPr1, and quantitative analyses using a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (CRT-PCR) confirmed overexpression of MRP gene products (about 8-fold determined by CRT-PCR) in this resistant clone. The P-gp expression was not detectable by the monoclonal antibody, C219, in the HL60/DOX cells, and that was consistent with extremely low levels of mdr1 mRNA expression determined by CRT-PCR in this clone. Drug accumulation and efflux studies demonstrated the significantly increased efflux rate of DOX compared to the parent HL60 cells. This enhancement of DOX efflux was reversed by the addition of 10 microM verapamil. To investigate the additional underlying mechanisms contributing to MDR phenotype in the HL60/DOX cells, the levels of DNA topoisomerases (Topo) including Topo I, Topo IIalpha, and Topo IIbeta, and gamma-glutamylcystein synthetase (y-GCS) expression were determined using CRT-PCR techniques. Normal expression of each enzyme at the transcriptional level was demonstrated in this resistant clone. Southern blot analysis of the gene organization in the HL60/DOX cells revealed the amplification of MRP gene. These results indicate that alteration of the drug accumulation from enhanced efflux appears to be a major mechanism(s) of MDR phenotype and attributable to high levels of MRP expression in the HL60/DOX cells. Overexpression of MRP in this clone is regulated by the genomic amplification of DNA and increased levels of the MRP mRNA, independently with the normal expression of Topo I, Topo IIalpha, Topo IIbeta, or gamma-GCS.","['Wada, H', 'Saikawa, Y', 'Niida, Y', 'Nishimura, R', 'Noguchi, T', 'Matsukawa, H', 'Ichihara, T', 'Koizumi, S']","['Wada H', 'Saikawa Y', 'Niida Y', 'Nishimura R', 'Noguchi T', 'Matsukawa H', 'Ichihara T', 'Koizumi S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'DNA/analysis', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1999/01/29 00:00,1999/01/29 00:01,['1999/01/29 00:00'],"['1999/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X98000277 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00027-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Jan;27(1):99-109. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00027-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of cases occur in patients who have malignant hematologic disease, particularly during chemotherapy induction or consolidations phases for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The principal risk factors are profound (PN < 500 per mm3) and prolonged (very high risk beyond 20 days) neutropenia, perturbed phagocyte function and cellular immune deficiency (AIDS, immunosuppressive treatment in organ and bone marrow recipients). Clinically, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis presents as acute non-specific pneumonia with cough, chest pain and fever. The severe infection rapidly becomes life-threatening. The development of massive hemoptysis is a major risk. We report four cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients who had hemoptysis. All four patients developed non-specific pneumonia resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics during post-chemotherapy aplasia. Computed tomography of the thorax and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed due to the occurrence of hemoptysis. In the first two cases, the patients were recovering from aplasia. The thoracic CT scan showed evidence of a cavitating mass with peripheral vessels. Bronchoscopy findings suggested mucosal lesions. The patients were managed surgically. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with the presence of ischemic necrosis of the pulmonary parenchyma harboring numerous aspergillus filaments. Outcome was favorable and chemotherapy was re-initiated in one case. These two patient died from their hematological disease a few months later. The other two patients remained in aplasia. A CT of the thorax showed multifocal infiltration with vascular contact. Bronchoscopy was again suggestive. One patient developed massive hemoptysis with respiratory distress.

The mAbs partially inhibited the plating of pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing envelope antigens of HTLV-I. Formation of proviral DNA was also inhibited when indicator cells were treated with the mAbs before adsorption of HTLV-I, but not after its adsorption. They did not inhibit syncytium formation induced by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Flow cytometry revealed that H16h hardly reacted with various HTLV-I-positive T cells, while H3e and H11b reacted with HTLV-I-positive human cells as well as HTLV-I-negative human cells. H11b and H16h immunoprecipitated the membrane antigen with a molecular weight of 20 and 110-130 kDa, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that H3e, H11b and H16h bound to the protein of 20, 20 and 110-130 kDa, respectively.

In this study, a murine retrovirus producing cell line (psi CRIP-pXT1) was incubated in variable concentrations of doxycycline. The retroviral titer of this cell line was measured by the ability to transfer resistance to G418 to NIH/3T3 cells. The retroviral titer was significantly decreased by 70% when the packaging cells had been incubated with 25 microM of doxycycline at 37 degrees C. The ID50 was around 8 micrograms/ml. Astonishingly, this effect was not observed at 32 degrees C. The mechanism of this effect is still to be determined.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included all cases of enterococcal bacteremia in neutropenic cancer patients documented between January 1986 and December 1995 in a 1,000-bed university hospital, where a prospective surveillance of all cases of bacteremia is regularly done. Molecular typing was performed on all vancomycin-resistant strains with the analysis of chromosomic DNA by macrorestriction. RESULTS: Seventeen cases of enterococcal bacteremia were documented. Seven (41%) were caused by vancomycin-resistant strains (E. faecium 3 and E. gallinarum 4), six of which occurred in the last 5 years of the study period. The average age of patients was 43 years (18-69) and most of them had acute leukemia. Eighty percent of these patients had received vancomycin and/or cephalosporins within 2 weeks prior to bacteremia. Previous administration of antibiotics was more frequent in patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci than in those with bacteremia caused by susceptible strains (86% vs 30%; p < 0.05). The mean number of previous antibiotics (2.4 vs 0.8; p < 0.05) as well as days of treatment (13.6 vs 4.3; p = 0.05) were also higher among patients with resistant enterococcal bacteremia. The overall mortality was 57%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the emergence of sporadic cases of bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci in neutropenic cancer patients in our area.

The frequency and association of gene alterations of p16, interferon alpha and interferon beta were investigated in a total of 39 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients. Of these, 10 patients (25.6%) presented abnormalities of at least one of the three genes studied. In 32 ALL cases studies of the three genes could be accomplished. In 23 out of 32 ALL cases the 3 genes studied were normally preserved. In the remaining 9 ALL, p16 was affected in 8 cases by homozygous deletions. In 2 patients, p16 deletion was associated with homozygous deletions for interferon alpha and interferon beta genes and in 1 case with total deletion of interferon beta 1 gene and partial deletion of interferon alpha. In the remaining 5 cases, p16 was the only gene deleted with no alteration of type I interferon genes. These data indicate that p16 gene is deleted in a higher frequency than type I interferon genes in ALL. Moreover, within the ALL group with p16 gene deletion, 37.5% are associated with interferon deletions and in general, ALL with alpha and/or beta interferon gene deletions are associated with p16 deletions. Therefore, p16 gene deletion with preserved type I interferon genes in some ALL suggests that the absence of this cdk inhibitor may disturb the normal cell cycle and favor blast transformation.","['Sternik, G', 'Pittis, M G', 'Gutierrez, M', 'Diez, R A', 'Sen, L']","['Sternik G', 'Pittis MG', 'Gutierrez M', 'Diez RA', 'Sen L']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Celular y Retrovirus, Hospital Nacional de Pediatria Juan P.

In addition, prophylactic administration of G-CSF was shown to significantly accelerate neutrophil recovery in most clinical trials. This was associated with a substantially reduced incidence and duration of febrile neutropenia and of severe infections in selected high risk patients receiving multiple treatment cycles, whereas the clinical benefit appears to be negligible in patients at low risk of infectious complications. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of GM-CSF as an adjunct to treatment for ALL outside of clinical trials. Apart from patient characteristics and type of CSF, it has become evident that scheduling of growth factor administration in relation to the type of chemotherapy, and use of different study end points influence the clinical efficacy of HGF administration. Although no studies have so far shown that use of growth factors is associated with reduced mortality, higher complete remission rates or superior survival, improvements in other clinical endpoints, e.g. infection rate, duration of i.v. antibiotics, and length of hospital stays were frequently perceived as clinically important and felt to contribute substantially to the patient's quality of life. It will become increasingly important to select those patients likely to benefit from growth factor support and to identify additional predictive criteria. Scheduling of CSFs, e.g. early versus delayed and prophylactic versus interventional administration, the type of growth factor used and the duration of administration need to be optimized in the context of specific treatment protocols. Although myeloid growth factors presently can not be expected to have a major impact on overall treatment outcome in patients with ALL, they facilitate important incremental improvement; in supportive care when appropriately applied. As the remaining open questions are resolved, clinical benefits may be achieved consistently and with a favorable cost benefit ratio.","['Ottmann, O G', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Ottmann OG', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Klinik III des Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany. ottmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",30,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001167 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00116-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Dec;22(12):1171-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00116-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there is a clinical requirement for a drug that will reliably alleviate the thrombocytopenia associated with leukemia therapy. The c-mpl ligand thrombopoietin is the most interesting factor for the treatment of thrombocytopenia because of its lineage specificity. Phase I and II studies confirm its biological efficacy to induce rise in platelet count in patients with solid tumors and acute leukemia. Several other pleiotropic hematopoietic growth factors are also currently in clinical trials. These include interleukin-6, interleukin-3, interleukin-11, PIXY321 and stem cell factor.

Hemopoietic growth factor receptors belong to two major families, the transmembrane protein tyrosine kinases and the hemopoietin receptors. Ligand binding stimulates receptor aggregation and activation resulting in transduction of signals that induce diverse cellular responses including proliferation, maturation, prevention of apoptosis and/or functional activation. Deregulation of hemopoiesis can result in leukemia, the malignant transformation of blood cells, or the development of other hemoproliferative disorders. As hemopoietic growth factor receptors are integral to blood cell regulation, it is feasible that receptor abnormalities may contribute to leukemia by circumventing normal growth factor control or altering the balance of proliferation and differentiation. Although considerable experimental evidence has clearly established the leukemogenic potential of mutated growth factor receptors, studies to date suggest that such abnormalities contribute only rarely to human disease.","['Alexander, W S', 'Nicola, N A']","['Alexander WS', 'Nicola NA']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research and the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, PO Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin']",134,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001106 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00110-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Dec;22(12):1097-111. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00110-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence is now growing to indicate that three key biological changes affecting the development of such clones are: (1) an increased probability of differentiation at the level of the most primitive leukemic stem cells; (2) an increased turnover rate of the leukemic progenitors at all stages of differentiation: and (3) their increased ability to survive under conditions of factor-deprivation. Such a model explains the long latent period for the development of CML as well as why normal stem cells may persist in large numbers but still fail to compete in contributing to the daily output of mature blood cells in patients with disease. The recent development of new genetic and transplant models of human CML may now allow the molecular basis of these biological disturbances to be delineated and more effective therapeutic strategies developed.,"['Eaves, C', 'Cashman, J', 'Eaves, A']","['Eaves C', 'Cashman J', 'Eaves A']","['BC Cancer Agency, and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. connie@terryfox.ubc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Division', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood']",86,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001131 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00113-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Dec;22(12):1085-96. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00113-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the change of HOX B6 and HOX B9 mRNA expressions during the in vitro differentiation of four myeloid leukemia cell lines because HOX B6 may be involved closely in myeloid differentiation. HL-60, NB4, NKM-1 and NOMO-1 were established from acute leukemia of M2, M3, M2 and M5 subtype of the French-American-British classification, respectively. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), TPA, and G-CSF were used as differentiation inducers. Each cell line was cultured with each inducer and total RNA was isolated on day 1, 2, 3, or 5. HOX B mRNA was detected by Northern blotting and RT-PCR methods. HOX B6 and HOX B9 mRNAs were constitutively expressed in NB4, NKM-1 and NOMO-1, but were expressed at very low levels in HL-60. HOX B6 and HOX B9 mRNAs were also expressed in fresh acute myelocytic leukemia blasts. HOX B6 mRNA expression in HL-60, NB4, and NKM-1 cultured with ATRA increased on day 3 and decreased on day 5. HOX B6 mRNA expression in NB4 and NKM-1 cultured with TPA decreased on day 3. HOX B9 mRNA expression displayed changes similar to those of HOX B6 mRNA in NB4 and NKM-1. These results indicate that myeloid leukemia cell lines express HOX B6 and HOX B9, and that their respective mRNA expressions in NB4 and HL-60 increase at a mid stage of myeloid differentiation by ATRA induction and then decrease during a late stage. HOX B6 mRNA expression decreased in monocytoid differentiation by TPA induction in NB4, HL-60 and NKM-1. HOX B6 antisense-oligonucleotide inhibited the proliferation of NB4 and NKM-1. These results suggest that HOX B gene expression is related to simultaneous activation of cellular proliferation and differentiation in leukemic cells.","['Ohnishi, K', 'Tobita, T', 'Sinjo, K', 'Takeshita, A', 'Ohno, R']","['Ohnishi K', 'Tobita T', 'Sinjo K', 'Takeshita A', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (HOXB6 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB9 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057620 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Nov;31(5-6):599-608. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057620.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is of clinical interest to find new potential modulators and compare their P-gp-modulating efficacy. The present analysis investigated the influence of P-gp modulators, such as verapamil, tamoxifen, droloxifene E, droloxifene Z, SDZ PSC 833 (PSC 833) and dexniguldipine in a leukemic T-cell line (CCRF-CEM) and its P-gp-resistant counterparts (CCRF-CEM/ACT400 and CCRF-CEM/VCR1000). P-gp expression was assessed with an immunocytological technique using the monoclonal antibody 4E3.16. It was characterized as the percentage of P-gp positive cells and also expressed as a D value by using the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic. The efficacy of P-gp modulators was determined with the rhodamine-123 accumulation test and the MTT test. An in vitro modulator concentration between 0.1 microM and 3 microM was determined, where no genuine antiproliferative effect was apparent. The modulators PSC 833 and dexniguldipine were the significant (p<C0.05) most potent chemosensitizers followed by verapamil, droloxifene Z, tamoxifen and droloxifene E in descending order. In addition to the modulators PSC 833 and dexniguldipine, droloxifene Z should especially be considered as a candidate for future ex vivo and in vivo studies. The main advantage of droloxifene Z could be the low rate of expected side effects. This fact permits the use of high Drol Z dosage in order to achieve a relevant modulating effect in vivo and to use this drug in combination with a further modulator so as to reach maximum efficacy with tolerable side effects.","['Nussler, V', 'Pelka-Fleisc, R', 'Gieseler, F', 'Hasmann, M', 'Loser, R', 'Gullis, E', 'Stotzer, O', 'Zwierzina, H', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Nussler V', 'Pelka-Fleisc R', 'Gieseler F', 'Hasmann M', 'Loser R', 'Gullis E', 'Stotzer O', 'Zwierzina H', 'Wilmanns W']","['Med.

Rapid tapering of Cyclosporin resulted in moderately severe acute GVHD in 2 cases, and in extensive chronic GVHD in a further 2 patients (fatal in 1 case). An antileukemic effect was observed in 6 patients, with complete haematological and cytogenetic remission observed in all cases. The seventh patient did not respond, and died after infusion of donor leucocytes. Four of the responders remain in complete remission of CML 30 to 120 months after BMT. One patient died in remission of chronic GVHD, and one patient had a complete response lasting 5 months, but relapsed and died 13 months post transplant. Rapid withdrawal of Cyclosporin therapy appears to be an effective means of treatment of early relapse of CML after transplant, and is an alternative to the use of donor leucocyte infusions for those patients still receiving Cyclosporin at the time of relapse.","['Brandenburg, U', 'Gottlieb, D', 'Bradstock, K']","['Brandenburg U', 'Gottlieb D', 'Bradstock K']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Service Westmead Hospital Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057613 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Nov;31(5-6):545-50. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057613.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty patients with a diagnosis of MDS (n = 30) or CMML (n = 30) were treated. Their median age was 66 years, with 50 patients (83%) being over 60 years of age at time of study entry. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 50% of patients and thrombocytopenia of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in 50%. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 4 to 6 weeks for two courses, then at maximum tolerated dose level (1-2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days) once every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Nineteen patients (31%) achieved a complete response (CR). A CR was achieved in 11 of 30 patients with MDS (37%) and in eight of 30 with CMML (27%). A CR was achieved in 10 of 23 patients with previously untreated MDS (43%). Eight of 11 patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five of which involved chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities) and achieved CR, were evaluated cytogenetically in CR: all were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics associated with a higher CR rate were lack of previous chemotherapy, absence of ras oncogene mutations, and presence of less than 10% monocytes in either peripheral blood or bone marrow. In contrast, CR rates were similar by different agent groups, by different karyotype abnormalities, and by other pre-therapy peripheral blood counts. Non-myelosuppressive side effects were mucositis in 67% of patients (severe [grade 3-4] 23%), diarrhea in 38% (severe 17%), and nausea and vomiting in 28% (severe 5%). Febrile episodes during neutropenia occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47 %. Mortality in the first four weeks was 20%. With a median follow-up duration of 31 months, the 12 month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months. In summary, topotecan has significant single-agent activity in MDS and CMML. Complete responses associated with topotecan therapy often involve the disappearance of abnormal, poor-prognosis karyotypes, which is particularly encouraging. Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine).","['Beran, M', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S M"", 'Giles, F J', 'Koller, C A', 'Kornblau, S', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Beran M', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Giles FJ', 'Koller CA', 'Kornblau S', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Topotecan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057611 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Nov;31(5-6):521-31. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057611.,['UO1-CA70172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were compared to numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities present in these leukemic cells. In a series of 95 patients, the percent with high lymphoblast methotrexate polyglutamate levels increased with the increase in modal number of total chromosomes (p<0.001). Thus, lymphoblast methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation appeared to be closely linked to the extent of hyperdiploidy in childhood pro-B ALL. Lymphoblasts from 35 (88%) of the 40 children with hyperdiploid (>50 chromosomes) and 23 (88%) of 26 with hyperdiploid (DNA Index >1.16) pro-B ALL accumulated high levels of methotrexate polyglutamate, suggesting that they were more sensitive to methotrexate cytotoxicity. While children with hyperdiploid (DNA Index >1.16) pro-B ALL have a good prognosis, those with trisomies of both chromosomes 4 and 10, almost all of whom are hyperdiploid, have an even better outcome. There was no significant difference in methotrexate polyglutamate levels in lymphoblasts from 19 children with and 21 without trisomies of both chromosomes 4 and 10 (p = 0.25). The improved response to multi-agent chemotherapy conferred by the presence of trisomies of both chromosomes 4 and 10 in such patients may be due to increased sensitivity of their lymphoblasts to one or more anti-leukemic agents in addition to methotrexate.","['Whitehead, V M', 'Vuchich, M J', 'Cooley, L D', 'Lauer, S J', 'Mahoney, D H', 'Shuster, J J', 'Payment, C', 'Koch, P A', 'Akabutu, J J', 'Bowen, T', 'Kamen, B A', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Emami, A', 'Look, A T', 'Beardsley, G P', 'Pullen, D J', 'Camitta, B']","['Whitehead VM', 'Vuchich MJ', 'Cooley LD', 'Lauer SJ', 'Mahoney DH', 'Shuster JJ', 'Payment C', 'Koch PA', 'Akabutu JJ', 'Bowen T', 'Kamen BA', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Emami A', 'Look AT', 'Beardsley GP', 'Pullen DJ', 'Camitta B']","[""The Penny Cole Hematology Research Laboratory, McGill University - Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Trisomy']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057610 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Nov;31(5-6):507-19. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057610.,"['CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This observation has been made studying both blood and bone marrow in children on widely differing treatment regimens from the 1970s to the present day. It appears to be independent of other classical prognostic factors such as age and diagnostic white cell count. Currently some major collaborative groups are using the rate of initial disease clearance to risk-stratify subsequent therapy and this practice may increase. The best way to measure the rate of disease clearance remains to be defined. Watching disappearance of peripheral blood blasts is the least invasive method but possibly the least sensitive. Molecular quantitation of minimal residual disease (MRD) after achievement of conventional remission is much more sensitive but less specific. It cannot be applied to all patients and is costly and time consuming. The degree of marrow infiltration remaining after 7 or 14 days may fall between the two but is often difficult to estimate reliably and reproducibly due to technical limitations. The three techniques may reflect response to therapy in a way slightly different from each other and may not be direct correlates. The best compromise may be to use all three but to reserve MRD study only for those who clear their blood and bone marrow after 7 days.,"['Lilleyman, J S']",['Lilleyman JS'],"[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, St Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine, St Bartholomew's Hospital, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",25,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057609 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Nov;31(5-6):501-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increased bleeding tendency of APL is caused by a massive proteolytic state, triggered by procoagulant substances, plasminogen activators and proteinases released into the circulation from leukemic cells. The introduction of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) into the treatment of APL has reduced bleeding complications. However the mechanisms of the hemostatic defects in patients with APL and their modifications during ATRA with or without chemotherapy are still incompletely understood. Attempts at characterizing and monitoring these hemostatic abnormalities have been made by using several laboratory parameters. Among them we have studied the structural modifications of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). In APL, plasma vWF is massively degraded, with specific fragments produced by the action of plasmin and elastase. After ATRA therapy, proteolysis diminishes progressively in parallel with the improvement of other hemostatic measurements. We conclude that abnormalities of vWF structure and function might adversely affect hemostasis in APL and that their improvement after ATRA administration might explain in part the effectiveness of this drug in reducing hemorrhagic complications.","['Federici, A B', ""D'Amico, E A""]","['Federici AB', ""D'Amico EA""]","['The Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, I.R.C.C.S.

However, pentostatin has been found to produce higher complete remission rates than IFN. The current study was undertaken to investigate response and long term follow-up in HCL patients treated with pentostatin. METHODS: Between March 1989 and October 1996, 49 patients with HCL and 1 patient with a HCL variant were treated with pentostatin. Eighteen patients had received no prior therapy, 31 patients had received prior treatment with IFN, and 1 patient had received prior treatment with 2'-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2'CdA) and IFN. All patients except 1 were treated with a dose of 4 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. The median number of cycles was 12. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 96% (48 of 50 patients); 22 patients (44%) achieved a complete response, 18 patients (36%) achieved a good partial response (defined as residual bone marrow infiltration < 5%), 8 patients (16%) achieved a partial response, and 2 patients died. For a median follow-up of 33 months off therapy, there were 5 recurrences between 12-66 months; 3 of these patients were treated further with and responded to 2'CdA and 2 died of disease progression at 12 and 40 months, respectively. In addition, 3 patients died of unrelated causes (1 of very early infection, 1 of toxic death and another of cardiac arrest) comprising an overall death rate of 14% (7 of 50 patients). The overall survival rate was 86% for a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 8-105 months). Major side effects were febrile episodes, herpes zoster, nausea/emesis, and pancytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirms both the high remission rate and durable responses that may be achieved with pentostatin treatment in HCL patients. Although pentostatin is active, the risk of cytopenia and immunosuppression must be evaluated carefully.","['Ribeiro, P', 'Bouaffia, F', 'Peaud, P Y', 'Blanc, M', 'Salles, B', 'Salles, G', 'Coiffier, B']","['Ribeiro P', 'Bouaffia F', 'Peaud PY', 'Blanc M', 'Salles B', 'Salles G', 'Coiffier B']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Benite, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/01/28 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/28 03:01'],"['1999/01/28 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/28 03:01 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990101)85:1<65::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990101)85:1<65::aid-cncr9>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jan 1;85(1):65-71. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990101)85:1<65::aid-cncr9>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors present a case of a 48-year-old male with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive CML and T-cell lymphoid BP after 17 months in the chronic phase. RESULTS: Plasma pharmacokinetic studies after an infusion of GW506U78 at a dose of 40 mg/kg showed GW506U78 concentrations of 60 microM, and a peak ara-G concentration of 260 microM in the plasma. Cellular ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP) concentration in the peripheral blood T-lymphoblasts was 80 microM at the end of GW506U78 infusion and reached a maximum of 150 microM. The patient achieved a complete response that lasted 13 months. Severe neurotoxicity related to GW506U78 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: GW506U78 showed antileukemic activity against Ph positive T-cell BP CML. Neurotoxicity was dose-limiting in this patient. Treatment with GW506U78 and modulation of ara-GTP concentrations are therapeutic strategies that require further exploration in T-cell malignancies.

Immunological demonstration of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the cytoplasm of AML blasts is considered to be a reliable and highly sensitive marker. Using a direct single and double immunofluorescence staining method and flow cytometry we evaluated the intracellular expression of two granular constituents of myeloid cells--MPO and lactoferrin (LF) in leukemia cells from 18 patients at AML diagnosis, two patients in remission after allogenic bone marrow transplantation and in six controls. Two different fixation/permeabilization techniques were used: Fix&Perm, paraformaldehyde and saponin prior to monoclonal antibody staining in order to verify the sensitivity of two labeling methods for MPO. Although both reagents used in this study proved to be efficient tools for the fixation and permeabilization of leukemia cells, the second one was characterized by higher sensitivity in detection of MPO. By double staining of MPO and LF we were able to distinguish undifferentiated cells from the granulomonocytic maturation compartments in bone marrow, since LF is proposed to be selectively expressed from the myelocyte stage of differentiation onward. Cytoplasmic CD13 expression was detectable in AML blasts after their buffered-formaldehyde-acetone fixation/permeabilization. According to our results the detection of MPO and CD13 markers in the cytoplasm of leukemia cells is of great importance in the definition of FAB M0-M1 subtype of AML. Furthermore we described overexpression of CD34 antigen in AML and revealed the characteristic marker combination when CD34 was studied simultaneously with MPO. This finding also coincided with some atypical phenotypic features (CD15/MPO, CD7/cCD13, CD2/cCD13, CD33/cCD13, MPO/cCD13) contributing to the differential diagnosis and allowing the immunologic monitoring of patients for the presence of residual disease.","['Konikova, E', 'Glasova, M', 'Kusenda, J', 'Babusikova, O']","['Konikova E', 'Glasova M', 'Kusenda J', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lactoferrin/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Permeability', 'Peroxidase/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Tissue Fixation']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1998;45(5):282-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LAZ3 encodes a transcriptional repressor with a POZ/zinc finger structure similar to several Drosophila development regulators and to the human promyelocytic leukemia-associated PLZF gene. Consistent with the origin of LAZ3-associated malignancies, LAZ3 is expressed in mature B-cells and required for germinal center formation. However, its ubiquitous expression, with predominant levels in skeletal muscle, suggests that it may act outside the lymphoid system. To study how LAZ3 could be involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, we examined its expression in the C2 muscle cells. We report here that LAZ3 is upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels during the differentiation of proliferating C2 myoblasts into post-mitotic myotubes. This rise in LAZ3 expression is both precocious and sustained, and is not reversed when myotubes are re-exposed to mitogen-rich medium, suggesting that irreversible evens occurring upon myogenic terminal differentiation contribute to lock LAZ3 upregulation. In addition, using two different models, we found that a ""simple"" growth-arrest upon serum starvation is not sufficient to induce LAZ3 upregulation which rather appears as a feature of myogenic commitment and/or differentiation. Finally, BrdU incorporation assays in C2 cells entering the differentiation pathway indicate that ""high"" LAZ3 expression strongly correlates with their exit from the cell cycle. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that LAZ3 could play a role in muscle differentiation. Together with some results reported in other cell types, we propose that LAZ3 may contribute to events common to various differentiation processes, possibly the induction and stabilization of the withdrawal from the cell cycle.","['Albagli-Curiel, O', 'Dhordain, P', 'Lantoine, D', 'Aurade, F', 'Quief, S', 'Kerckaert, J P', 'Montarras, D', 'Pinset, C']","['Albagli-Curiel O', 'Dhordain P', 'Lantoine D', 'Aurade F', 'Quief S', 'Kerckaert JP', 'Montarras D', 'Pinset C']","['INSERM U124, Onco-Hematologie Moleculaire, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60663-0 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6410033.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1998 Nov;64(1):33-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6410033.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to Skipper's scheme, based on constancy of cancer cell proliferation or post-chemotherapy decrease slope, the same chemotherapy successive cycles decrease in fact less and less the proportion of cell number reduction, and the hope of killing the ""last cell"" is a utopian concept. Hence, the very poor global benefit in cancer medicine registered in the last 50 years. The only cures are seen in child tumors and young adults testis cancer: the immunity reaction being stronger before 40 years of age than after 40 may explain this difference with age. The a priori systematic opposition to active immunotherapy of cancer from some authorities has been a grave fault. Such fault should not be committed for the treatment of HIV1-AIDS complex. The continuous HIV1 so called intensive virostatic chemotherapy is complicated by severe toxicities, and resistances of relapses and virus re-activation when it must be discontinued. The widely accepted triple therapy only affects two virus targets (retro-transcriptase and virus protease), which is insufficient, as we have shown. We have also observed that the constant and most rapid VL decrease to < 200 or < 20 RNA copies/mL is obtained when four virus targets are affected, including some concerning DNA provirus (which is the case of acriflavine and methylhydroxy-ellipticine). As in acute lymphoid leukemia, two treatment phases can be distinguished: a) the VL reduction to 20 copies; b) the maintenance of the residual < 20 copies of viruses. Excellent results as far as VL decrease and maintenance at < 20 copies have been obtained with a follow-up between 1 1/2 and 6 years, without any toxicity nor global resistance, with combinations of four drugs affecting four viral targets, applied in short (3 week) sequences, different from each others owing to drug rotation. This can be compared with the 65% remission rate obtained with alternative different cycles of cancer chemotherapy in tumors resistant to conventional modalities. The possibility of repeating for ten patients the evaluation of viral load and of immunologic parameters has allowed us to discover that some VL decrease curves are fractal. As well, maintenance 20 copies are not rarely interrupted by short and reversible HIV1 rebounds as those we had described in ""cured"" acute lymphoid leukemia patients. Of utmost importance, all HIV1 rebounds were associated with the presence of one cofactor: chimerism, chronic hepatitis, CMV, herpes 8, herpes 6, and influenza are those we observed. The problem today is not to ""kill the last tumor cell in cancer"" or ""the last HIV1 particle"" in HIV1-AIDS complex. It is to keep the residual cells or virus in latency. Active immunotherapy and other biologic interventions, such as hypermethylation, should be studied in this aim, as they are also able to do so.","['Mathe, G']",['Mathe G'],,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Review']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,,IM,"['Animals', 'HIV Infections/*pathology/*virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Neoplasms/*pathology']",49,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(99)80018-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0753-3322(99)80018-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1998;52(10):413-20. doi: 10.1016/S0753-3322(99)80018-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that an early event in the cell membrane of myeloblastic leukemia (ML-1) cells was the vigorous activation of the voltage-gated K+ channel by UV irradiation. The strong enhancement by UV irradiation of K+ channel activity in the cell membrane subsequently activated the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway and resulted in myeloblastic leukemia cell apoptosis. Suppression of UV-induced K+ channel activation with specific channel blockers prevented UV-induced apoptosis through inhibition of UV-induced activation of the proteins SEK (SPAK kinase) and JNK. However, suppression of K+ channel activity could not protect cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis, which bypasses the membrane event. Elimination of extracellular Ca2+ had no effect on the UV-induced and K+ channel-mediated JNK/SAPK activation. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism in which activation of K+ channels by UV-irradiation upstream of SEK and SAPK/JNK mediates UV-induced myeloblastic cell apoptosis.","['Wang, L', 'Xu, D', 'Dai, W', 'Lu, L']","['Wang L', 'Xu D', 'Dai W', 'Lu L']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio 45435, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Potassium Channels)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Ion Transport', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Potassium Channels/agonists/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.6.3678 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87995-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Feb 5;274(6):3678-85. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.6.3678.,"['CA59985/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY11653/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46834/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One cause of MDR is overexpression of the drug-effluxing protein, P-glycoprotein. It is now apparent that P-glycoprotein may also possess a more generic antiapoptotic function that protects P-glycoprotein-expressing cancer cells and normal cells from cell death. Herein we show that cells induced to express P-glycoprotein either by drug selection or by retroviral gene transduction with MDR1 cDNA are resistant to cell death induced by a wide range of death stimuli, such as FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, that activate the caspase apoptotic cascade.However, P-glycoprotein-expressing cells were not resistant to caspase-independent cell death mediated by pore-forming proteins and granzyme B.MDR P-glycoprotein-expressing cells were made sensitive to caspase-dependent apoptosis by the addition of anti-P-glycoprotein antibodies or verapamil, a pharmacological inhibitor of P-glycoprotein function. Clonogenic assays showed that P-glycoprotein confers long-term resistance to caspase-dependent apoptotic stimuli but not to caspase-independent cell death stimuli. This study has confirmed a potential novel physiological function for P-glycoprotein and it now remains to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of capsase-dependent cell death by P-glycoprotein.","['Johnstone, R W', 'Cretney, E', 'Smyth, M J']","['Johnstone RW', 'Cretney E', 'Smyth MJ']","['The Austin Research Institute, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia. r.johnstone@ari.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Genes, MDR', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48824-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):1075-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the compound is apoptogenic in primary cultures of freshly isolated APL blasts obtained from a newly diagnosed case and an ATRA-resistant relapsed patient. NB4 cells in the S-phase of the cycle are most sensitive to CD437-triggered apoptosis. CD437-dependent apoptosis does not require de novo protein synthesis and activation of RAR-gamma or any of the other nuclear retinoic acid receptors. The process is preceded by rapid activation of a caspase-like enzymatic activity capable of cleaving the fluorogenic DEVD but not the fluorogenic YVAD tetrapeptide. Increased caspase activity correlates with caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation. Inhibition of caspases by z-VAD suppresses the nuclear DNA degradation observed in NB4 cells treated with CD437, as well as the degradation of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-7. CD437-dependent activation of caspases is preceded by release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol of treated cells. Leakage of cytochrome c lays upstream of caspase activation, because the phenomenon is left unaffected by pretreatment of NB4 cells with z-VAD. Treatment of APL cells with CD437 is associated with a caspase-dependent degradation of promyelocytic leukemia-RAR-alpha, which can be completely inhibited by z-VAD.","['Mologni, L', 'Ponzanelli, I', 'Bresciani, F', 'Sardiello, G', 'Bergamaschi, D', 'Gianni, M', 'Reichert, U', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Terao, M', 'Garattini, E']","['Mologni L', 'Ponzanelli I', 'Bresciani F', 'Sardiello G', 'Bergamaschi D', 'Gianni M', 'Reichert U', 'Rambaldi A', 'Terao M', 'Garattini E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Laboratory of Cancer Chemotherapy, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri,"" Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD 437)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'S Phase', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48821-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):1045-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age, sex ratio, and bone lesion extension were similar, but PCL cases displayed a higher prevalence of clinical stage III, extramedullary involvement, and Bence Jones cases, with fewer IgA cases than for MM patients. In addition, according to several prognostic indicators (beta2-microglobulin serum level, proportion of S-phase PCs, proteinuria, calcium serum level, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and renal function), the incidence of adverse prognostic factors was significantly higher in PCL versus MM. Immunophenotypic expression was similar for CD38, CD138, CD2, CD3, CD16, CD10, CD13, and CD15, but PCL differed from MM in the expression of CD56, CD9 HLA-DR, CD117, and CD20 antigens. Twenty-two PCL cases were diploid and one was hypodiploid, while most MM cases (57%) showed DNA hyperdiploidy. With the fluorescent in situ hydridization (FISH) technique, 12 of 13 PCL cases displayed the numeric aberrations, -13 (86%), +/-1 (57%), +18 (43%), and -X in women (25%), but they lacked several numeric aberrations usually found in MM such as +3, +6, +9, +11, and +15. PCL cases had a lower overall response to therapy than MM cases (38% v 63%, P =.01332). Among PCL patients, a trend for a worse response was observed in cases treated with melphalan and prednisone (MP) versus polychemotherapy. Overall survival was significantly worse in PCL versus MM patients (8 v 36 months, P <.0001), but it was significantly better in PCL patients treated with polychemotherapy versus MP (18 v 3 months, P =.0137).

We have analyzed the molecular basis of this lesion in three patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two of whom were known to have chromosome 12 breakpoints within the ETV6 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ETV6 cosmids indicated that this gene was also disrupted in the third patient, while the normal ETV6 allele was retained. 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from bone marrow mRNA of this individual identified a novel sequence fused to ETV6 that was homologous to a region just upstream of the mouse CDX2 homeobox gene, the human homologue of which has previously been mapped to chromosome 13q12. PCR primers designed to amplify an ETV6-CDX2 fusion identified two major transcripts from this patient. First, a direct in-frame fusion between exon 2 of ETV6 and exon 2 of CDX2, and second, a transcript that had an additional sequence of unknown origin spliced between these same exons. Surprisingly, apparently normal CDX2 transcripts, usually expressed only in intestinal epithelium, were also detectable in cDNA from this patient. Neither normal nor fusion CDX2 mRNA was detectable in the two other patients with a t(12;13), indicating that this translocation is heterogeneous at the molecular level. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that CDX2 mRNA, but not ETV6-CDX2 mRNA, was strongly expressed in 1 of 10 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in transformation, suggesting that deregulation of this gene may be more widespread in leukemia. CDX2 is known to regulate class I homeobox genes and its expression in hematopoietic cells may critically alter the balance between differentiation and proliferation.","['Chase, A', 'Reiter, A', 'Burci, L', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Pickard, J', 'Roberts, I A', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Chase A', 'Reiter A', 'Burci L', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Pickard J', 'Roberts IA', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ETV6-CDX2 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics/ultrastructure', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48818-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):1025-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the mechanisms of bone marrow suppression induced by HHV-6 infection, it is necessary to establish an in vitro model of HHV-6 infection in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have established two novel Philadelphia chromosome-positive myeloid cell lines, SAS413 and SAS527, which possess different hematologic characteristics and show distinct susceptibility to infection by HHV-6, from a patient with blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). HHV-6 subgroup A (HHV-6A) showed marked replication in SAS413, forming syncytia and inducing cell lysis in short-term culture. On the other hand, HHV-6A-inoculated SAS527 continued to proliferate without cell lysis and only a few cells showed HHV-6 antigen expression. In contrast to HHV-6A infection, inoculation with HHV-6 subgroup B (HHV-6B) did not induce any cytopathic effect (CPE) or viral antigen expression in either of the cell lines. Although HHV-6B replication was undetectable, the presence of the HHV-6 genome in both cell lines was shown by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during culture for more than 10 months, suggesting that HHV-6B latently infected SAS413 and SAS527. Phorbol ester treatment of SAS527 latently infected with HHV-6B resulted in reactivation of HHV-6, as shown by the appearance of a CPE, positive reactivity for the HHV-6 antigen, and isolation of infectious HHV-6. These novel cell lines should be useful for studying the mechanisms of HHV-6-induced hematopoietic failure and HHV-6 latency and reactivation, as well as differentiation, of the myeloid cell lineage.","['Yasukawa, M', 'Ohminami, H', 'Sada, E', 'Yakushijin, Y', 'Kaneko, M', 'Yanagisawa, K', 'Kohno, H', 'Bando, S', 'Fujita, S']","['Yasukawa M', 'Ohminami H', 'Sada E', 'Yakushijin Y', 'Kaneko M', 'Yanagisawa K', 'Kohno H', 'Bando S', 'Fujita S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan. yasukawa@m.ehimeu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/growth & development/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/virology', '*Virus Activation/drug effects', '*Virus Latency', 'Virus Replication']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48814-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):991-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A DEK-CAN fusion peptide-specific CD4(+) Th0 CTL clone, designated HO-1, was established from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a healthy individual. HO-1 exerted direct but not ""innocent bystander"" cytotoxicity within 2 hours. The cytotoxicity mediated by HO-1 was completely Ca2+-dependent. Because HO-1 lysed peptide-loaded Fas-deficient target cells derived from a patient with a homozygous Fas gene mutation, its cytotoxicity appeared to be mediated by a Fas-independent pathway. In addition, its cytotoxicity was only partially inhibited by treatment with concanamycin A and strontium ions, which are inhibitors of the perforin-based cytotoxic pathway. Although membrane-bound type of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was expressed on HO-1, an anti-TNF-alpha antibody had no effect on HO-1-mediated cytotoxicity. HO-1 expressed mRNA for apoptosis-inducing mediators, including perforin, granzyme B, Fas ligand, TNF-alpha, and lymphotoxin; however, no DNA fragmentation was detected in target cells incubated with HO-1 by 5-[125I]Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine release assay and agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA. Although it has been suggested that the Fas/Fas ligand system is the main pathway by which CD4(+) CTL-mediated cytotoxicity is exerted in murine systems, HO-1 produced peptide-specific and HLA-restricted cytotoxicity via a Fas-independent and nonapoptotic pathway. The present study thus describes a novel mechanism of cytotoxicity mediated by CD4(+) CTL.","['Ohminami, H', 'Yasukawa, M', 'Kaneko, S', 'Yakushijin, Y', 'Abe, Y', 'Kasahara, Y', 'Ishida, Y', 'Fujita, S']","['Ohminami H', 'Yasukawa M', 'Kaneko S', 'Yakushijin Y', 'Abe Y', 'Kasahara Y', 'Ishida Y', 'Fujita S']","['First Departments of Internal Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (DEK-CAN fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '80890-47-7 (concanamycin A)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'YZS2RPE8LE (Strontium)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Macrolides', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Strontium/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/physiology']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48808-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):925-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We isolated an active 125-kD component of LAI from HL-60 conditioned medium (CM), subjected it to cyanogen bromide cleavage and show by amino acid sequencing of the resulting peptides that it consists of a complex of the serine proteinase inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin and a 31-kD fragment that retained the S-phase inhibitory activity, but resisted sequencing. This finding suggested that the 31-kD fragment originated from one of the neutrophil serine proteases (ie, elastase, proteinase 3, or cathepsin G) produced by normal promyelocytes, as well as HL-60 cells, for storage in primary granules and partly secreted during synthesis as enzymatically inactive proforms. Immunoblot analysis showed that the 125-kD complex contained proteinase 3 (PR3), and immunoprecipitation of PR3 from HL-60 CM abrogated the S-phase inhibitory activity, whereas immunoprecipitation of cathepsin G or elastase did not. Immunoprecipitation of PR3 from CM of a subpopulation of normal marrow cells also abrogated the S-phase inhibitory effect. Furthermore, CM from rat RBL and murine 32D cell lines transfected with human PR3 both reduced the fraction of CFU-GM in S-phase with 30% to 80% at 1 to 35 ng/mL PR3, whereas CM of the same cells transfected with cathepsin G or elastase did not. Also, an enzymatically silent mutant of PR3 exerted full activity, showing that the S-phase modulatory effect is not dependent on proteolytic activity. Amino acid sequencing of biosynthetically radiolabeled PR3 showed that PR3 from transfected cells is secreted after synthesis as proforms retaining amino terminal propeptides. In contrast, mature PR3 extracted from mature neutrophils has only minor activity. The inhibitory effect of secreted PR3 is reversible and abrogated by granulocyte (G)- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Experiments with highly purified CD34(+) bone marrow cells suggested that PR3 acts directly on the granulopoietic progenitor cells. These observations suggest a role for PR3 in regulation of granulopoiesis, and possibly in suppression of normal granulopoiesis in leukemia.","['Skold, S', 'Rosberg, B', 'Gullberg, U', 'Olofsson, T']","['Skold S', 'Rosberg B', 'Gullberg U', 'Olofsson T']","['Department of Hematology, Research Department 2, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Feedback', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloblastin', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/isolation & purification/physiology']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48799-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):849-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these family members, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is most closely related to OSM, and various overlapping biologic activities have been described between human LIF and OSM (hLIF and hOSM). Two types of functional hOSM receptors are known: the type I OSM receptor is identical to the LIF receptor that consists of gp130 and the LIF receptor beta subunit (LIFRbeta), and the type II OSM receptor consists of gp130 and the OSM receptor beta subunit (OSMRbeta). It is thus conceivable that common biologic activities between hLIF and hOSM are mediated by the shared type I receptor and OSM-specific activities are mediated by the type II receptor. However, in contrast to the human receptors, recent studies have demonstrated that mouse OSM (mOSM) does not activate the type I receptor and exhibits unique biologic activity. To elucidate the molecular structure of the functional mOSM receptor, we cloned a cDNA encoding mOSMRbeta, which is 55.5% identical to the hOSMRbeta at the amino acid level. mOSM-responsive cell lines express high-affinity mOSM receptors, as well as mOSMRbeta, whereas embryonic stem cells, which are responsive to LIF but not to mOSM, do not express mOSMRbeta. mOSMRbeta alone binds mOSM with low affinity (kd = 13.0 nmol/L) and forms a high-affinity receptor (kd = 606 pmol/L) with gp130. Ba/F3 transfectants expressing both mOSMRbeta and gp130 proliferated in response to mOSM, but failed to respond to LIF and human OSM. Thus, the cloned mOSMRbeta constitutes an essential and species-specific receptor component of the functional mOSM receptor. Reminiscent of the colocalization of the mOSM and mLIF genes, the mOSMRbeta gene was found to be located in the vicinity of the LIFRbeta locus in the proximal end of chromosome 15.","['Tanaka, M', 'Hara, T', 'Copeland, N G', 'Gilbert, D J', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Miyajima, A']","['Tanaka M', 'Hara T', 'Copeland NG', 'Gilbert DJ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Miyajima A']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Genes', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48795-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):804-15.,,,['GENBANK/AB015978'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions of etoposide and mitoxantrone with PSC were anticipated, measured in comparison with historical controls without PSC, and showed a 57% decrease in etoposide clearance (P =.001) and a 1.8-fold longer beta half-life for mitoxantrone in plasma (P <.05). The doses of mitoxantrone and etoposide were substantially reduced to compensate for these interactions and clinical toxicity and in Cohort II were well tolerated at dose levels of 4 mg/m2 mitoxantrone, 40 mg/m2 etoposide, and 1 g/m2 C daily for 5 days. Overall, postchemotherapy marrow hypoplasia was achieved in 33 patients. Twelve patients (32%) achieved complete remission, four achieved partial remission, and 21 failed therapy. The PK observations correlated with enhanced toxicity. The probability of an infectious early death was 36% (4 of 11) in patients with high PK parameters for either drug versus 5% (1 of 20) in those with lower PK parameters (P =.04). P-gp function was assessed in 19 patients using rhodamine-123 efflux and its inhibition by PSC. The median percentage of blasts expressing P-gp was increased (49%) for leukemic cells with PSC-inhibitable rhodamine efflux compared with 17% in cases lacking PSC-inhibitable efflux (P =.004).

Cells from 19 AML patients with a variety of chromosomal abnormalities were studied for their ability to generate DC. In all but 1 case, cells with the morphology, phenotypic characteristics, and T-cell stimulatory properties of DC could be generated. These cells expressed high levels of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens as well as the costimulatory molecules B7-2 and ICAM-1. In three cases these cells were determined to be of leukemic origin by fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomal abnormalities or Western blotting for the inv(16) fusion gene product. Autologous lymphocytes cocultured with AML-derived DC (DC-AL) were able to lyse autologous leukemia targets, whereas little cytotoxicity was noted against autologous, normal cells obtained from the patients during remission. We conclude that leukemia derived DC may be useful for immunotherapy of many AML patients.","['Choudhury, B A', 'Liang, J C', 'Thomas, E K', 'Flores-Romo, L', 'Xie, Q S', 'Agusala, K', 'Sutaria, S', 'Sinha, I', 'Champlin, R E', 'Claxton, D F']","['Choudhury BA', 'Liang JC', 'Thomas EK', 'Flores-Romo L', 'Xie QS', 'Agusala K', 'Sutaria S', 'Sinha I', 'Champlin RE', 'Claxton DF']","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48792-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Feb 1;93(3):780-6.,['CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas GRalpha is a hormone-activated transcription factor, GRbeta does not bind glucocorticoids (GCs), is transcriptionally inactive, and is a potential inhibitor of activated GRalpha. Differential expression of GR isoforms may play a role in generalized or tissue-specific GC resistance. GCs induce apoptosis in neoplastic lymphoid cells; and, defective apoptosis is implicated in the genesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We studied a patient with generalized GC resistance and CLL. GR number in the patient's transformed lymphocytes was approximately one half that of control cells with a approximately 10-fold reduction in binding affinity for dexamethasone. In vitro apoptosis induction in CLL cells was delayed in response to GCs, but not to other apoptosis inducers. Sequencing of the GR cDNA and gene including the 2.3-kb coding region, the intron/exon junctions, the known 5'-regulatory region, and approximately 300 bp of the 3'-region revealed no alterations. Western blot with an N-terminal antibody showed normal levels of immunoreactive GR, but quantitative analysis with isoform-specific C-terminal antibodies revealed a markedly reduced GRalpha expression, and high GRbeta expression. These findings indicate that imbalanced expression of the GR isoforms may be a mechanism of GC resistance, and may have implications for tumorigenesis by enhancing cell survival.","['Shahidi, H', 'Vottero, A', 'Stratakis, C A', 'Taymans, S E', 'Karl, M', 'Longui, C A', 'Chrousos, G P', 'Daughaday, W H', 'Gregory, S A', 'Plate, J M']","['Shahidi H', 'Vottero A', 'Stratakis CA', 'Taymans SE', 'Karl M', 'Longui CA', 'Chrousos GP', 'Daughaday WH', 'Gregory SA', 'Plate JM']","[""Department of Medicine, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, 1725 West Harrison Street, Suite 821, Chicago, 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dexamethasone/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*blood/chemistry/genetics']",,1999/01/28 00:00,1999/01/28 00:01,['1999/01/28 00:00'],"['1999/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)99980-6 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.9980 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Jan 27;254(3):559-65. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.9980.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of WT1 expression also have been detected in myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting that WT1 may be important in other neoplasms as well. To seek a role of high level expression of WT1 in the differential arrest characteristic of myeloid leukemia, WT1 or its zinc-finger domain alone was stably expressed in human promyeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells and the ability of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to induce macrophage differentiation was examined. HL-60 cell differentiation was completely arrested in TPA treated cells that expressed WT1 or its zinc-finger domain alone whereas TPA fully induced macrophage differentiation in control HL-60 cells, indicating that high level expression of WT1 is capable of differentiation arrest of myeloid cells and that its effect may be mediated through its zinc-finger domain. To determine if the zinc-finger domain of WT1 directly influences transcription, it was brought to promoter DNA as a fusion protein with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The fusion protein failed to regulate transcription of a reporter gene but when the zinc-finger domain of WT1 was brought to DNA with a promoter containing two upstream WT1-binding sites, reporter gene expression was activated approximately threefold, suggesting that WT1 interferes with myeloid differentiation through the ability of its zinc-finger domain to compete with other transcription factors for common promoter elements.","['Deuel, T F', 'Guan, L S', 'Wang, Z Y']","['Deuel TF', 'Guan LS', 'Wang ZY']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA.

Much less is known about how astrocyte generation is normally controlled. Here we report the purification and characterization of astrocyte precursor cells (APCs) from the developing rat optic nerve. APCs are antigenically distinct from astrocytes. Both cell types are Pax2(+) and vimentin+, whereas astrocytes are GFAP+ and S100beta+, and the precursor cells are A2B5(+). In contrast to purified astrocytes, purified APCs rapidly die in serum-free culture but can be saved by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and glial growth factor 2 (GGF2). Unlike oligodendrocyte precursor cells, APCs do not differentiate by default; their differentiation into GFAP+ cells is induced by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Finally, the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of APCs were promoted by coculture with other embryonic optic nerve cell types but not with purified embryonic retinal ganglion cells, indicating that interactions with non-neuronal cells are likely to play an important role in controlling astrocyte generation in the developing optic nerve.","['Mi, H', 'Barres, B A']","['Mi H', 'Barres BA']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Neurobiology, Fairchild Science Building, Stanford, California 94305-5125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glia Maturation Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/growth & development', 'Antigens/analysis', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glia Maturation Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Optic Nerve/*cytology/embryology/growth & development', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/*physiology']",,1999/01/27 00:00,1999/01/27 00:01,['1999/01/27 00:00'],"['1999/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1999 Feb 1;19(3):1049-61.,"['5F32NS10015/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 EY10257/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6782146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this pilot study, we have measured PG production induced by lipoproteins of six diabetic patients with poor metabolic control, compared to five healthy controls. Plasma lipoprotein levels were similar in both groups. Lipoprotein fractions were purified by sequential ultracentrifugation. After lipoprotein incubation with cells, supernatants were extracted and PG quantified by HPLC. In presence of LDL, in control subjects, there was an increase in total PG production, mainly due to thromboxane B2 (TxB2). In diabetic patients, the secretion pattern was similar. In presence of HDL, in control subjects, total PG secretion was also increased, but it was balanced between TxB2 and prostacyclin. In diabetic patients, at low HDL concentration (10 mg/l) the secretion was mainly due to TxB2, while at higher HDL concentrations (100 mg/l). the secretion was balanced between TxB2 and prostacyclin. Comparison of means of areas under curve for the two groups studied showed that LDL increased all PG secretion in diabetic patients compared to controls (P < 0.05 for PGF2alpha), while HDL increased all PG secretion in controls compared to diabetic patients, except PGF2alpha. Our work suggests a key role of LDL in TxB2 secretion in diabetic patients, which is a major proaggregant and vasoconstrictive agent. There was also an increased secretion of all PG in diabetic patients.","['Fredenrich, A', 'Jambou, D', 'Bayer, P', 'Hieronimus, S', 'Lapalus, P', 'Harter, M']","['Fredenrich A', 'Jambou D', 'Bayer P', 'Hieronimus S', 'Lapalus P', 'Harter M']","[""Department of Endocrinology, Hopital de l'Archet 1, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, France. afredenrich@compuserve.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,"['0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolism', 'Epoprostenol/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandins/*metabolism', 'Thromboxane B2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/27 03:03,2000/02/19 09:00,['1999/01/27 03:03'],"['1999/01/27 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/27 03:03 [entrez]']","['S0021-9150(98)00207-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0021-9150(98)00207-x [doi]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 1999 Jan;142(1):217-24. doi: 10.1016/s0021-9150(98)00207-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QSAR have also been derived for the inhibitory activity of the anilinoacridines with tumor cells and their binding to DNA. These results are compared with reactivity with simple nucleophiles. The comparative analysis shows the importance of electron releasing substituents (in general negative coefficients with the Hammett parameter sigma+) throughout the various systems and the complete lack of hydrophobic interactions from DNA to cells to mice. The presence of steric terms suggests that a protein receptor is involved. The study shows that QSAR has an important role to play in improving the efficiency in the design of bioactive compounds and that care must be taken in the design of a set of congeners so that the necessary parameters are available to do the QSAR analysis.

We report in this study on a second generation TSH binding inhibitory assay using the human recombinant TSH-R with two major improvements: 1) superior diagnostic sensitivity for Graves' disease, and 2) for the first time, nonradioactive and radioactive coated tube (CT) technology. Full-length human recombinant TSH-R was expressed in the K562 leukemia cell line and grown in suspension at a high density. A murine monoclonal antibody was selected for binding to the native TSH-R without interfering with autoantibodies or TSH and was coated to polystyrene tubes. After detergent extraction, TSH-R was affinity immobilized on antibody-coated tubes. The binding of TSH to the TSH-R could be demonstrated by the addition of 125I- or acridinium ester-labeled bovine TSH, and this binding could be inhibited by sera from patients with Graves' disease up to 95%. Subsequently, these novel assays, a CT RRA and a CT luminescence receptor assay, were compared to the conventional RRA based on porcine antigen in a blinded clinical multicenter trial. Sera from 328 patients with Graves' disease (86 untreated, 116 treated, and 126 in remission) and 520 controls (comprised of healthy blood donors and patients with autoimmune diseases or goiter) were tested in all 3 assays. Receiver-operating characteristic plot analysis resulted in a specificity of 99.6% with a sensitivity of 98.8% for both CT assays, compared to 99.6% specificity and 80.2% sensitivity for the conventional RRA (P < 0.001). In all 3 groups of patients with Graves' disease, the 2 CT assays were significantly more sensitive for the disease than the conventional assay, without loss of specificity in the control groups.

Additionally, this region has been shown to be involved in early infection events in a wide spectrum of retroviruses, including mammalian type C [e.g., murine leukemia virus (MuLV)], human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Rous sarcoma virus, and other retroviruses. Mutations in the two Zn2+-fingers of the NC protein of simian immunodeficiency virus strain Mne [SIV(Mne)] have been generated. The resulting virions contained the normal complement of processed viral proteins with densities indistinguishable from wild-type SIV(Mne). All of the mutants had electron micrograph morphologies similar to those of immature particles observed in wild-type preparations. RNA packaging was less affected by mutations in the NC protein of SIV(Mne) than has been observed for similar mutants in the MuLV and HIV-1 systems. Nevertheless, in vitro replication of SIV(Mne) NC mutants was impaired to levels comparable to those observed for MuLV and HIV-1 NC mutants; replication defective NC mutants are typically 10(5)- to 10(6)-fold less infectious than similar levels of wild-type virus. One mutant, DeltaCys33-Cys36, was also found to be noninfectious in vivo when mutant virus was administered intravenously to a pig-tailed macaque. NC mutations can therefore be used to generate replication defective virions for candidate vaccines in the SIV macaque model for primate lentiviral diseases.","['Gorelick, R J', 'Benveniste, R E', 'Gagliardi, T D', 'Wiltrout, T A', 'Busch, L K', 'Bosche, W J', 'Coren, L V', 'Lifson, J D', 'Bradley, P J', 'Henderson, L E', 'Arthur, L O']","['Gorelick RJ', 'Benveniste RE', 'Gagliardi TD', 'Wiltrout TA', 'Busch LK', 'Bosche WJ', 'Coren LV', 'Lifson JD', 'Bradley PJ', 'Henderson LE', 'Arthur LO']","['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC-Frederick, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, SAIC-Frederick, Frederick, Maryland, 21702-1201, USA. gorelick@avpaxp1.ncicrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cysteine', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Virion', 'Virus Replication', '*Zinc Fingers']",,1999/01/27 00:00,1999/01/27 00:01,['1999/01/27 00:00'],"['1999/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99513-7 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9513 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Jan 20;253(2):259-70. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9513.,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor protein p16(INK4a) and thus has been thought to contribute to induction of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We examined the mutagenic effects of Tax on a cellular gene, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt), and LacI gene in lambda shuttle vector exogenously integrated in Big Blue Rat-2 (BBRat-2) cells. Expression of Tax in BBRat-2 cells enhanced the frequency of HPRT(-) phenotype severalfold. Tax-expressing cell clones, BBTax-1 and -2 established from BBRat-2 cells, gave rise to an average mutation frequency of 5.9 x 10(-5) in LacI gene, but Tax-negative cell clones, BBRat-C1 and -C2, showed 2. 1 x 10(-5). The 2.8-fold increase in mutation frequency in the presence of Tax indicates that Tax expression enhanced mutation frequency in chromosomal DNA. However, neither the mutation spectrum of base transitions, transversions, and deletions/insertions nor the loci of the mutations were significantly affected by Tax expression. These findings indicate that Tax has the capability to induce random mutations and suggest that Tax would be able to modulate cellular phenotypes through mutation of the cellular genome.","['Miyake, H', 'Suzuki, T', 'Hirai, H', 'Yoshida, M']","['Miyake H', 'Suzuki T', 'Hirai H', 'Yoshida M']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Lac Repressors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Genome', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Lac Repressors', '*Mutagenesis', 'Rats', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology']",,1999/01/27 00:00,1999/01/27 00:01,['1999/01/27 00:00'],"['1999/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99500-9 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9500 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Jan 20;253(2):155-61. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9500.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell surface recognition sites that bound ME with high affinity and specificity were detected for NALM 6 (pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and Jurkat (T lymphoma) cells. Brain-like enkephalin receptors were measured for these lymphocytes using conventional radioligand-receptor assays and the highly delta opioid receptor-selective enkephalin analog [3H]DPDPE. Upon activation, the lymphocyte enkephalin receptors transmitted signals that enhanced the accumulation of intracellular cAMP. These studies provide evidence that cultured human lymphocytes of the B (NALM 6 cells) and T (Jurkat cells) lineages express functional enkephalin receptors and suggest that such receptors may be instrumental in the lymphocyte response to opioid peptides and alkaloids.","['Heagy, W', 'Teng, E', 'Lopez, P', 'Finberg, R W']","['Heagy W', 'Teng E', 'Lopez P', 'Finberg RW']","['Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA. heagy001@gold.tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid)', '100929-53-1 (Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-)', '36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)', '58569-55-4 (Enkephalin, Methionine)', '88373-73-3 (Enkephalin, D-Penicillamine (2,5)-)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-', 'Enkephalin, D-Penicillamine (2,5)-', 'Enkephalin, Methionine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enkephalins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Naloxone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Opioid/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction']",,1999/01/27 00:00,1999/01/27 00:01,['1999/01/27 00:00'],"['1999/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(98)91409-5 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1998.1409 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1999 Jan 10;191(1):34-48. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1998.1409.,"['R01AI29657/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R0DA10166/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpene that inhibits 5-lipoxygenase in a selective, enzymedirected, nonredox, and noncompetitive manner. To investigate a possible effect of AKBA on leukemic cell growth, proliferation of HL-60 and CCRF-CEM cells was assayed in the presence of AKBA and a structural analog without effect on 5-lipoxygenase, amyrin. Cell counts and [3H]thymidine incorporation were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of AKBA (IC50 = 30 microM) but not amyrin. An additive effect of AKBA with the crosslinking of the CD95 receptor was also observed. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells indicated that the cells underwent apoptosis. This was confirmed by flow cytometric detection of sub-G1 peaks in AKBA-treated cells and by DNA laddering. However, because HL-60 and CCRF-CEM do not express 5-lipoxygenase mRNA constitutively, a mechanism distinct from inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase must account for the effect of AKBA. In a DNA relaxation assay with phiX174RF DNA, AKBA inhibited topoisomerase I from calf thymus at concentrations of >/=10 microM. A semiquantitative cDNA polymerase chain reaction approach was used to estimate the relative level of expression of topoisomerases in both cell lines. The data suggest that induction of apoptosis in HL-60 and CCRF-CEM by AKBA may be due to inhibition of topoisomerase I in these cells.","['Hoernlein, R F', 'Orlikowsky, T', 'Zehrer, C', 'Niethammer, D', 'Sailer, E R', 'Simmet, T', 'Dannecker, G E', 'Ammon, H P']","['Hoernlein RF', 'Orlikowsky T', 'Zehrer C', 'Niethammer D', 'Sailer ER', 'Simmet T', 'Dannecker GE', 'Ammon HP']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacology, Tuebingen, Germany.rrhoernl@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (acetyl-11-ketoboswellic acid)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'KM8353IPSO (beta-amyrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Oleanolic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/26 00:00,1999/01/26 00:01,['1999/01/26 00:00'],"['1999/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999 Feb;288(2):613-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge this is the largest cohort of HCL patients treated with this type of regimen. Median follow-up amounted to 36 months. Fifty-six of 97 patients with typical HCL were newly diagnosed and 41 were relapsed after previous treatment. Splenectomy as a first-line therapy was performed in 23 patients and 18 remaining patients received prednisone, chlorambucil or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) alone or in combinations. Seventy-five (77.3%) patients entered CR and 18 (18.6%) achieved PR, giving an overall response rate of 95.9%. The mean time of first CR duration amounting to 32 months (range 3-72) did not correlate to the number of 2-CdA cycles. 2-CdA was equally effective in treatment of newly diagnosed patients and patients who relapsed after previous therapeutic procedures. Relapse of the disease occurred in 20 of 75 patients who achieved CR after 2-CdA and was usually manifested by very discrete changes in peripheral blood counts (neutropenia and/or relative lymphocytosis). The mean progression-free survival (PFS) time in this group was 37.4 (range 10-66) months. Ten of 20 relapsed patients were retreated with 2-CdA given an identical course to the first one. Seven patients entered second CR lasting 19+ (range 8-47) months and 3 experienced PR. This confirms the previous observations that 2-CdA gives no resistance to leukemic clone. Ten remaining patients have not required retreatment so far and remain in a good clinical and hematological state. The results of HCL-V treatment with 2-CdA were poor. Only 2 patients achieved PR and 4 patients did not respond to this drug. Seven patients (5 with typical HCL and 2 with HCL-V) died, 3 of causes unrelated to the disease. Second neoplasms were noted in 5 patients. 2-CdA-related side effects resulted mainly from myelosuppression and infectious complications. In conclusion we confirm the effectiveness of 2-CdA in inducing CR in patients with typical HCL, but this drug is unable to completely eradicate the leukemic clone which results in the relapse of the disease. The real incidence of the relapse rate may be underestimated unless bone marrow biopsy is performed. The results of our study indicate that a 2-h infusion of 2-CdA in HCL patients is at least as effective as a 24-h infusion but more convenient to the patients, and may be given on an outpatient basis.","['Robak, T', 'Blasinska-Morawiec, M', 'Blonski, J', 'Hellmann, A', 'Halaburda, K', 'Konopka, L', 'Kotlarek-Haus, S', 'Potoczek, S', 'Hansz, J', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Urasinski, I', 'Zdziarska, B', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, J', 'Holowiecki, J', 'Skotnicki, A B']","['Robak T', 'Blasinska-Morawiec M', 'Blonski J', 'Hellmann A', 'Halaburda K', 'Konopka L', 'Kotlarek-Haus S', 'Potoczek S', 'Hansz J', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Urasinski I', 'Zdziarska B', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Holowiecki J', 'Skotnicki AB']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland. robaktad@pskz.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/secondary', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Poland', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/01/26 00:00,1999/01/26 00:01,['1999/01/26 00:00'],"['1999/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01114.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Jan;62(1):49-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01114.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that a high bcl-2 expression and the presence of autonomous proliferation are related to a poor prognosis in AML.","['Bincoletto, C', 'Saad, S T', 'da Silva, E S', 'Queiroz, M L']","['Bincoletto C', 'Saad ST', 'da Silva ES', 'Queiroz ML']","['Department of Physiology, State University of Campinas - UNICAMP, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis']",,1999/01/26 00:00,1999/01/26 00:01,['1999/01/26 00:00'],"['1999/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01112.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Jan;62(1):38-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01112.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that both A/G and G/T motif oligonucleotides recognize and bind strongly to a critical polypurine sequence interrupted in the middle by two adjacent cytosines and located in the promoter of the human bcr gene at the transcription initiation. The interaction between the designed TFO and this irregular poly (R.Y) target has been studied using a number of techniques, including electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), circular dichroism (CD), DNase I, and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting. Although CD shows that the 24-mer TFO self-aggregate in solution, they bind to the bcr target at 37 degrees C, forming stable triplexes that do not dissociate during electrophoretic runs performed up to 50 degrees C in 50 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl (buffer A). We used EMSA to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the reaction T <==> D + TFO at 37 degrees C, either in buffer A or in 50 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaCl (buffer B). The triplexes were found to be more stable in buffer B, a behavior that can be rationalized in terms of monovalent and divalent cation competition for binding to DNA. Footprinting experiments showed that the TFO interact with the irregular poly (R.Y) target in a highly sequence-specific way and that the A/G motif oligonucleotide, juxtaposing T to the double CG inversions of the target, formed the most stable triplex (e.g., 1 microM TFO promoted strong footprints at 37 degrees C). These triplexes, except the one containing two A.C.G mismatched triads, are not destabilized under near physiologic conditions, that is, in 50 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.4, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM spermidine. Moreover, we found that guanine N7 in T.C.G and guanine N7 in A.C.G are both accessible to DMS and that the first is less reactive than the second. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that a critical sequence in the human ber promoter may be used as a potential binding site for TFO designed to repress artificially the transcription of the fused bcr/abl gene expressed in leukemia cells.","['Xodo, L E', 'Manzini, G', 'Quadrifoglio, F']","['Xodo LE', 'Manzini G', 'Quadrifoglio F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, University of Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (triplex DNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Humans', 'Magnesium/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Purines/*chemistry', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry', 'Sodium/chemistry']",,1999/01/26 00:00,1999/01/26 00:01,['1999/01/26 00:00'],"['1999/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/oli.1.1998.8.477 [doi]'],ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998 Dec;8(6):477-88. doi: 10.1089/oli.1.1998.8.477.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 29 pediatric BMT patients were studied. TESTING: Comprehensive ophthalmic check-up, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), Schirmer's test, tear breakup time, and slit-lamp and fundus examinations, was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tear film instability and its related complications, IOP, cataract, and fundus lesions were measured. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 9.1 years (range, 1.5-15 years). The mean post-BMT duration was 20.2 months (range, 3-54 months). Fifteen patients (51.7%) had tear abnormalities. Subconjunctival fibrosis was detected in two patients (6.9%). Dry and scaly skin of the eyelids was seen in one patient (3.4%). Lens opacities were found in 2 (33.3%) of 6 irradiated patients and 2 (8.7%) of 23 nonirradiated patients. Two patients (6.9%) had fundus changes, one with unilateral epiretinal membrane and the other with bilateral multiple discrete chorioretinal hypopigmented lesions in the middle to peripheral part of the retina. The overall complication rates for the anterior and posterior segments were 75.8% and 6.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations of BMT in children are not uncommon. The most common anterior segment problem is tear dysfunction. Posterior segment complications are less common but do exist. High rate of cataract formation is reported, and this probably is the most important long-term ""amblyogenic"" problem in these immature eyes. Awareness and management of these problems with routine eye examination and early intervention are recommended.","['Ng, J S', 'Lam, D S', 'Li, C K', 'Chik, K W', 'Cheng, G P', 'Yuen, P M', 'Tso, M O']","['Ng JS', 'Lam DS', 'Li CK', 'Chik KW', 'Cheng GP', 'Yuen PM', 'Tso MO']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Eye Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Fundus Oculi', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Tears/chemistry', 'Visual Acuity', 'beta-Thalassemia/therapy']",,1999/01/26 00:00,1999/01/26 00:01,['1999/01/26 00:00'],"['1999/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(99)90023-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90023-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1999 Jan;106(1):160-4. doi: 10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90023-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) during immunosuppressive treatment in children with malignancies is a severe complication with a poor prognosis if mechanical ventilation is required. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a recognized technique that provides temporary respiratory support for patients with intractable respiratory failure. PROCEDURE: We here report successful ECMO support in four children with PCP, secondary to chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, in whom the respiratory situation deteriorated despite pharmacological treatment and mechanical ventilation. The duration of ECMO was 7-43 days. RESULTS: Three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia recovered from their PCP to continue chemotherapy and are now in complete continuous remission. Their pulmonary function normalized completely during 6-12 months after ECMO therapy. One child with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor survived the PCP and was off ECMO for 11 days before succumbing to unrelated complications. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ECMO offers an important means of respiratory support in children with severe PCP that can also be adopted during treatment for malignant disease.","['Linden, V', 'Karlen, J', 'Olsson, M', 'Palmer, K', 'Ehren, H', 'Henter, J I', 'Kalin, M']","['Linden V', 'Karlen J', 'Olsson M', 'Palmer K', 'Ehren H', 'Henter JI', 'Kalin M']","['Department of Pediatric Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Karolinska Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors/drug therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,1999/01/26 03:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/26 03:00'],"['1999/01/26 03:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/26 03:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199901)32:1<25::AID-MPO6>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199901)32:1<25::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Jan;32(1):25-31. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199901)32:1<25::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Osteonecrosis may complicate the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To have more information about the natural history and clinical course of the development of osteonecrosis, a prospective MRI study was designed. PROCEDURE: The development of osteonecrosis was studied prospectively in 24 consecutive children with ALL who underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning of the lower extremities at the beginning of, during, and at the cessation of the chemotherapy. The general bone marrow signal intensity was assessed together with focal lesions. Circumscribed lesions with a rim of low signal intensity were considered typical of osteonecrosis. RESULTS: Nine of the 24 patients (rate 38%) developed osteonecrosis during the treatment. Six of them were asymptomatic. MRI lesions regressed in size in six patients, and in three patients the MRI finding returned to normal. No operative treatment was needed. The osteonecroses appeared immediately or within a few months after the delayed intensification phase with intensive dexamethasone medication. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids have been considered to be the main pathogenetic factor in the development of osteonecrosis in children with malignancies, which was also suggested by our findings. However, there is a lack of systematic prospective studies concerning the natural history and long-term follow-up observations of the prognosis of osteonecrosis, especially in pediatric patients. Based on our results, the lesions are often asymptomatic and cause no disability, and spontaneous improvement or even resolution may occur.","['Ojala, A E', 'Paakko, E', 'Lanning, F P', 'Lanning, M']","['Ojala AE', 'Paakko E', 'Lanning FP', 'Lanning M']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Oulu University Hospital, Finland. aojala@cc.oulu.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leg Bones/drug effects/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Survival Rate']",,1999/01/26 03:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/26 03:00'],"['1999/01/26 03:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/26 03:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199901)32:1<11::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199901)32:1<11::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Jan;32(1):11-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199901)32:1<11::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed our experience with the infants diagnosed with ALL at Children's Memorial Hospital from 1992 to 1997. PROCEDURE: During this time period, 10 infants were diagnosed with ALL. Seven of them were transplanted, four with marrow from HLA-matched siblings and three with umbilical cord blood. Four of the transplanted patients had the MLL gene rearrangement and the other three transplanted patients had one or more other high-risk features including CD10-blasts, age less than 6 months at diagnosis, or prior relapse. The patients were conditioned with a regimen of total body irradiation (TBI), etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (CY). Peritransplant toxicity was tolerable. The graft infused contained a median total nucleated cell dose/kg of 3 x 10(8) (.3 x 10(8)-6 x 10(8)). The median CD34+ cell dose/kg was 5 x 10(6) (.25 x 10(6)-31 x 10(6)). RESULTS: All of the patients engrafted with a median of 18 days (11-29) to reach an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 500/microliter. The median time to reach an unsupported platelet count greater than 20,000/microliter was 24 days (18-64). Four of seven of the transplanted patients are leukemia-free survivors at a median follow-up of 775 days. Of the three patients who were not transplanted, one is surviving 2+ years off therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplant is an alternative to chemotherapy alone as a treatment for infant ALL when a suitable donor is available.","['Pirich, L', 'Haut, P', 'Morgan, E', 'Marymount, M', 'Kletzel, M']","['Pirich L', 'Haut P', 'Morgan E', 'Marymount M', 'Kletzel M']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Medical School, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL 60614, USA. l-pirich@nwu.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1999/01/26 03:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/26 03:00'],"['1999/01/26 03:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/26 03:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199901)32:1<1::AID-MPO2>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199901)32:1<1::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Jan;32(1):1-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199901)32:1<1::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorted NK cells were examined for cytotoxic activity and NK co-cultured with K562 were examined for cytokine secretion, phenotyping and DNA fragmentation. The cytotoxic activity was inhibited and was not alleviated by cytokine treatment. Whereas the cytokine treatment maintained NK cell viability for several days, NK cell viability was decreased significantly in the presence of K562 target cells. Downregulation of CD16 and upregulation of CD69 on NK cells were induced by K562 target cells and no modulation of these antigens was observed with cytokine treatment. A subpopulation of target-treated NK cells succumbed to cell death by apoptosis and cell death was not rescued by the activating cytokines. These findings demonstrate that target-induced functional inactivation and apoptosis of NK cells were not rescued by the activating cytokines IL-2, IL-12, and IL-15 regardless of whether the NK cells were pretreated with cytokines prior to exposure to K562 or the cytokines were added to the NK-K562 mixtures. These results also suggest that signals triggered by the target cells and resulting in NK cell anergy and apoptosis override cytokine-mediated signals for activation, cell proliferation, and survival.","['Cavalcanti, M', 'Jewett, A', 'Bonavida, B']","['Cavalcanti M', 'Jewett A', 'Bonavida B']","['Instituto de Microbiologia Professor Paulo de Goes, Departamento de Imunologia, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', '*Tumor Escape']",,1999/01/26 00:00,1999/01/26 00:01,['1999/01/26 00:00'],"['1999/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.14.2.361 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 Feb;14(2):361-6. doi: 10.3892/ijo.14.2.361.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon (IFN)-alpha may induce hematological remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, but only a small proportion of patients achieve a sustained, complete cytogenetic remission. We have investigated the possibility of transducing CML cells with the retroviral vector LIalpha2SN, which encodes the IFN-alpha2 gene. We first optimized the transduction efficiency using the CML-derived K562 cell line. A transduction efficiency of 50% and 85% after three and six infections, respectively, was obtained in K562 cells. We then expressed IFN-alpha2 in CML cells by transducing the latter with LIalpha2SN viral particles. The IFN-alpha secretion after three and six infections was 5,400 and 18,000 U/24 hours/10(6) cells for unselected K562 cells and 7,000 and 290 U/24 hours/10(6) cells for CML CD34+ cells at days 4 and 5. Moreover, the major histocompatibility complex class I antigens were overexpressed after infection with LIalpha2SN in both K562 and CML CD34+ cells. The proliferation (in liquid culture) and the cloning efficiency of these CML cells were significantly decreased after LIalpha2SN treatment. By contrast, the proliferation of cord blood CD34+ cells was not affected by transduction with LIalpha2SN. These results demonstrate the transduction efficiency of CML cells and suggest the possibility of CML cell immunotherapy with retroviral gene transfer of different cytokines such as IFN-alpha.","['Salesse, S', 'Moreau-Gaudry, F', 'Pigeonnier-Lagarde, V', 'Mazurier, F', 'Chahine, H', 'Ged, C', 'de Verneuil, H', 'Reiffers, J', 'Mahon, F X']","['Salesse S', 'Moreau-Gaudry F', 'Pigeonnier-Lagarde V', 'Mazurier F', 'Chahine H', 'Ged C', 'de Verneuil H', 'Reiffers J', 'Mahon FX']","['Laboratoire de Pathologie Moleculaire et Therapie Genique, Institut Federatif de Recherches Biologie des Greffes, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, MHC Class I/drug effects', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1998 Nov-Dec;5(6):390-400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In tissues with rapid cell turnover terminally differentiated cells undergo programmed cell death. Terminal differentiation, thus, represents one form of negative growth control. It was surmised that the molecular engine which drives the differentiation process forward requires induction of positive regulators of terminal cell differentiation, to be found among differentiation primary response genes, as well as suppression of negative regulators, which correspond to genes which control cellular growth. This line of thought has prompted the isolation of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, upon IL-6 induced terminal differentiation of murine M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, where the cells growth arrest and ultimately undergo programmed cell death. As delineated in this review many of the genes identified as MyD genes, including both known genes [IRF-1, (AP-1)Fos/Jun.EGR-1] and novel ones (MyD88, MyD116, MyD118), turned out to play a role in negative growth control, including growth suppression and apoptosis, in many cell types, of both hematopoietic and non hematopoietic origins.","['Liebermann, D A', 'Hoffman, B']","['Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (GADD45B protein, human)', '0 (Gadd45b protein, mouse)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tl protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Ppp1r15a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/physiology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Insect Proteins/metabolism', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/physiology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",165,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202574 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Dec 24;17(25):3319-29. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202574.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently available monoclonal antibodies to CD10 have been found to be effective only in fresh-frozen tissue and for techniques such as flow cytometry. We have used a recombinant protein corresponding to the whole of CD10 to generate a monoclonal antibody that is effective in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. We have used this antibody to assay for the presence of CD10 on a range of normal and pathological tissues. Strong staining was seen in lymphoid germinal centers, renal tubules, glomeruli, syncytiotrophoblast, hepatic parenchymal canaliculi, B-lineage ALL, follicle center cell lymphoma, and a proportion of cases of large-B-cell lymphoma.

Recent studies have shown that the type III sodium-dependent Pi transporters, Glvr-1 and Glvr-2, are expressed in human osteoblast-like cells and have suggested a potential role for type III transporters in regulated Pi handling in osteogenic cells. To address the relevance of these findings in the context of bone formation in vivo and, in particular, in relation to matrix calcification, we investigated expression of the Glvr-1 transporter by in situ hybridization in developing embryonic murine metatarsals, using human Glvr-1 cDNA as a probe. In this model of endochondral ossification, expression of transcripts encoding Glvr-1 could be detected from day 17 of embryonic development. A hybridization signal for Glvr-1 was specifically observed in a subset of hypertrophic chondrocytes and could not be detected in osteoblasts. The expression of Glvr-1 mRNA was compared with that of transcripts encoding extracellular matrix proteins. Glvr-1 mRNA expression was confined to a population of early hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing type X collagen and to slightly more mature cells that express transcripts encoding osteopontin but lack type X collagen mRNA. No Glvr-1 transcripts were detected in fully differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes. This pattern of Glvr-1 mRNA expression was maintained throughout embryonic development until after birth. In conclusion, the Glvr-1 phosphate transporter is selectively expressed in a subset of hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral bone formation, in a region where matrix mineralization proceeds. This observation represents the first in vivo evidence consistent with a potential role for this phosphate transporter in matrix calcification.","['Palmer, G', 'Zhao, J', 'Bonjour, J', 'Hofstetter, W', 'Caverzasio, J']","['Palmer G', 'Zhao J', 'Bonjour J', 'Hofstetter W', 'Caverzasio J']","['WHO Collaborating Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (IBSP protein, human)', '0 (Ibsp protein, mouse)', '0 (Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone Development/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cartilage/embryology/metabolism', 'Collagen/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein', 'Metatarsal Bones/*embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteopontin', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S8756-3282(98)00151-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s8756-3282(98)00151-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 1999 Jan;24(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/s8756-3282(98)00151-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panel of cytokines was surveyed for changes in LTC4 synthase mRNA in THP-1 cells. TGF-beta1, -2, and -3 had significant stimulatory effects. The addition of TGF-beta resulted in a time-dependent increase in LTC4 synthase mRNA at 6 h, which persisted through 48 h. Furthermore, this conditioning resulted in an increase in immunoreactive protein for LTC4 synthase through 7 days. TGF-beta conditioning of cells resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in stimulated LTC4 synthase activity. Following transient transfection of THP-1 cells with a promoter-reporter construct containing 1.2 kb of the LTC4 synthase promoter, TGF-beta treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in reporter activity. Conditioning with TGF-beta did not prolong the half-life of LTC4 synthase mRNA, as assessed by RNase protection assays in actinomycin D-treated cells. Cycloheximide exposure experiments revealed that new protein synthesis was not required for the observed stimulatory effect of TGF-beta on LTC4 synthase mRNA.

Here we report that stimulation of the 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNFR-1) induced an overall decrease in filamentous actin (F-actin), inhibited CSF-1- and Cdc42-dependent filopodium formation, and stimulated macropinocytosis. Using a panel of TNFR-1 mutants, the regions of the receptor required for each of these responses were mapped. The decrease in F-actin required both the death domain and the membrane proximal part of the receptor, whereas inhibition of filopodium formation and increased pinocytosis were only dependent upon a functional death domain. When the TNF-induced decrease in F-actin was inhibited using either receptor mutants or the compound D609, TNF-stimulated actin reorganization at the cell cortex became apparent. This activity was dependent upon the FAN-binding region of TNFR-1. We conclude that different domains of TNFR-1 mediate distinct changes in the Mphi cytoskeleton, and that the ability of TNF to inhibit Mphi chemotaxis may be due to decreased filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42.","['Peppelenbosch, M', 'Boone, E', 'Jones, G E', 'van Deventer, S J', 'Haegeman, G', 'Fiers, W', 'Grooten, J', 'Ridley, A J']","['Peppelenbosch M', 'Boone E', 'Jones GE', 'van Deventer SJ', 'Haegeman G', 'Fiers W', 'Grooten J', 'Ridley AJ']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. m.p.peppelenbosch@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', '*Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Macrophages/enzymology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Peptide Fragments/physiology', 'Pinocytosis/drug effects', 'Pseudopodia/enzymology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/chemistry/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jan 15;162(2):837-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic marrow transplantation (BMT) has been used to overcome resistance of the leukemic clone resulting in long-term survival of up to 20%. Due to lack of suitable related donors BMT from an HLA-compatible unrelated donor (MUD) has been increasingly applied in these patients during the last years. Between January 1991 and August 1997 twenty five patients with advanced acute myeloid (n=19) or lymphoid (n=6) leukemia, 11 males and 14 females, age 22 to 41 (median 32) years received MUD (n=22) or 1-antigen mismatched unrelated donor (n=3) grafts. In four patients an autologous BMT had been performed previously. For conditioning all patients were given total body irradiation containing regimens. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CSA) and methotrexate (n=24) or CSA and methylprednisone (n=1). In 23 patients (92%) class II region compatibility was assessed by DRB1, DRB3, DRB5, and DQB1 allele typing by hybridization of amplified DNA with ligation based typing. In 2 patients HLA-DR typing was performed by two colour fluorescence cytotoxicity test and mixed lymphocyte cultures. As of November 1997 10/25 patients (40%) are surviving leukemia-free after a median observation time of 17 (range, 3 to 38) months. Transplant-related mortality was an overall of 36% and 28% in patients receiving their first BMT. In 6/25 patients (24%) relapse occurred 2 to 26 months after BMT. Incidence of acute GVHD grade I to IV was 85%. The probability of relapse projected at 3 years was 35%. High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by MUD marrow infusion has a curative potential for patients with advanced acute leukemia and offers the chance of long-term leukemia-free survival. Currently, up to 80% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) under the age of 50 years achieve complete hematological remission (CR) with conventional dose chemotherapy. However, in patients who are refractory to induction chemotherapy or relapse prognosis is still poor. There, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic marrow infusion has been used to overcome resistance of the refractory leukemic clone and has resulted in long-term survival. For selected patients lacking a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatible family donor marrow transplantation (BMT) with a suitable unrelated marrow donor (MUD) has become a feasible and effective treatment. Here, we report our experience in patients with advanced acute leukemia given marrow grafts from unrelated donors.","['Greinix, H T', 'Reiter, E', 'Schulenburg, A', 'Keil, F', 'Lechner, K', 'Fischer, G', 'Rosenmayr, A', 'Leitner, G', 'Kalhs, P']","['Greinix HT', 'Reiter E', 'Schulenburg A', 'Keil F', 'Lechner K', 'Fischer G', 'Rosenmayr A', 'Leitner G', 'Kalhs P']","['University of Vienna, Dep. of Medicine I, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (von Willebrand Factor)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'von Willebrand Factor/genetics']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Dec;22 Suppl 4:S53-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapy was excellent tolerated and clinical side effects occurred in only eight patients. The drug had to be withdrawn in one episode. A significant influence of liposomal amphotericin-B on laboratory parameters was not observed. Creatinine increased under therapy from a median base point of 1,0 (0,2-3,5) mg/dl to the upper normal value of 1,4 (0,4-4,2) mg/dl. Heavy increases of creatinine as well as of bilirubin, OT and PT were mostly associated with GvHD or regimen related toxicity. Considering the high-risk state of the patients the overall response rate was favourable with 62,9%. However, despite administration of liposomal amphotericin-B culture-proven mycoses were associated with a high morbidity (93,3%). Only one of fourteen patients was cured from Candida lambica septicaemia. We conclude that the antimycotic therapy with liposomal amphotericin-B has a low incidence of side effects. This should, considering the high mortality of fungal infections in BMT recipients, encourage investigators to perform dose escalating studies against the conventional formulation.","['Kruger, W H', 'Kroger, N', 'Russmann, B', 'Renges, H', 'Kabisch, H', 'Zander, A R']","['Kruger WH', 'Kroger N', 'Russmann B', 'Renges H', 'Kabisch H', 'Zander AR']","['Dept.

Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Abnormal ABL-related protein with increased tyrosine kinase activity suggested a molecular mechanism of CML. The BCR/ABL fusion gene can be found not only in the chromosome but in interphase nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We employed both fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and FISH to study the lineage involvement of individual stem cells and progenitor cells in patients with CML. Evidence of BCR/ABL fusion was found in pluripotent stem cells (CD34+, Thy1+), myeloid cells, B progenitor cells (CD34+, CD19+) and T/NK progenitor cells (CD34+, CD7+, CD5+) but not mature T cells (CD3+) or natural killer cells (CD3-, CD56+). These data suggested that BCR/ABL gene fusion occurs in pluripotent stem cells and that Ph+ T cells and natural killer cells are eliminated during differentiation.","['Miura, A']",['Miura A'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Akita University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Lecture', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

This condition is reversed by infusion of LIF or by transferral of embryos to pseudopregnant, wild-type mice. This led us to hypothesize that embryonic diapause in the spotted skunk is due to insufficient uterine expression of LIF whereas resumption of development and implantation are associated with increased LIF expression. We also investigated the hormonal control of LIF expression. Uterine concentrations of LIF mRNA were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Changes in cell-specific localization of LIF mRNA and protein were determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. LIF mRNA was detected but was not abundant during embryonic diapause; it then increased when blastocysts resumed development and remained elevated prior to implantation. LIF mRNA and protein could not be localized in the uterus during embryonic diapause but were quite apparent in luminal and glandular epithelium during blastocyst activation. Prolactin, progesterone, and estradiol failed to increase uterine concentrations of LIF mRNA above those in ovariectomized controls. These data are consistent with the initial hypothesis and suggest that LIF may somehow be involved in preparing the uterus for implantation in the spotted skunk.","['Hirzel, D J', 'Wang, J', 'Das, S K', 'Dey, S K', 'Mead, R A']","['Hirzel DJ', 'Wang J', 'Das SK', 'Dey SK', 'Mead RA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83844, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Estradiol/blood/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*genetics', 'Mephitidae/*metabolism', 'Ovariectomy', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/blood/pharmacology', 'Prolactin/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Uterus/chemistry/*metabolism']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod60.2.484 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1999 Feb;60(2):484-92. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod60.2.484.,"['HD 12304/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 34247/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'RR11833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This indicates that LIF plays an important role in placental development. The expression of LIF-R and LIF was examined in human trophoblast and decidua using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. LIF-R mRNA and immunoreactivity was localized in villous and extravillous trophoblast throughout pregnancy, and in endothelial cells of the fetal villi. Strong expression of mRNA encoding LIF was detected in decidual leukocytes, which are abundant at the implantation site. Extravillous trophoblast, which invades the maternal decidua, therefore expresses LIF-R as it moves past decidual leukocytes, which express LIF mRNA. The effect of LIF on cultured human trophoblast was examined in vitro. Recombinant human LIF had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation by purified extravillous trophoblast, nor on expression of integrins alpha1, alpha5, or beta1 by isolated trophoblast. These results identify fetal endothelial cells and all cells of the trophoblast lineage as targets for the action of LIF in human placenta. Although its effects on trophoblast are not yet clear, LIF appears to mediate interactions between maternal decidual leukocytes and invading trophoblast. LIF may also play a critical role in controlling angiogenesis in the placental villi, since human fetal endothelial cells express LIF-R, and mice lacking a functional LIF receptor gene show altered vascular development in the placenta.","['Sharkey, A M', 'King, A', 'Clark, D E', 'Burrows, T D', 'Jokhi, P P', 'Charnock-Jones, D S', 'Loke, Y W', 'Smith, S K']","['Sharkey AM', 'King A', 'Clark DE', 'Burrows TD', 'Jokhi PP', 'Charnock-Jones DS', 'Loke YW', 'Smith SK']","['Reproductive Molecular Research Group, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Maternity Hospital, Cambridge CB2 2SW, United Kingdom. ams@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Decidua/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrins/analysis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Placenta/blood supply/*chemistry', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/chemistry/metabolism']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod60.2.355 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1999 Feb;60(2):355-64. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod60.2.355.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although anorexia is common, a decreased food intake alone is unable to account for the changes in body composition seen in cancer patients, and increasing nutrient intake is unable to reverse the wasting syndrome. Although energy expenditure is increased in some patients, cachexia can occur even with a normal energy expenditure. Various factors have been investigated as mediators of tissue wasting in cachexia. These include cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as well as tumor-derived factors such as lipid mobilizing factor (LMF) and protein mobilizing factor (PMF), which can directly mobilize fatty acids and amino acids from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle respectively. Induction of lipolysis by the cytokines is thought to result from an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), although clinical studies provide no evidence for an inhibition of LPL in the adipose tissue of cancer patients. Instead there is an increased expression of hormone sensitive lipase, the enzyme activated by LMF. Protein degradation in cachexia is associated with an increased activity of the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The biological activity of both the LMF and PMF was shown to be attenuated by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Clinical studies show that this polyunsaturated fatty acid is able to stabilize the rate of weight loss and adipose tissue and muscle mass in cachectic patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Knowledge of the mechanism of cancer cachexia should lead to the development of new therapeutic agents.","['Tisdale, M J']",['Tisdale MJ'],"['Pharmaceutical Sciences Institute, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,,IM,"['Anorexia/metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism/physiology', 'HIV Wasting Syndrome/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Weight Loss/physiology']",46,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/129.1.243S [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 1999 Jan;129(1S Suppl):243S-246S. doi: 10.1093/jn/129.1.243S.,,,,,,,,10.1093/jn/129.1.243S [doi],,,,,,,,,

We investigated the binding of phospholipid vesicles to the monocytic leukemia cell lines THP-1 and J774A.1 with a flow cytometric assay; vesicles contained 50 mol% PtdSer, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), or phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro), with the balance being phosphatidylcholine. Specific, high affinity binding was observed for vesicles containing PtdSer, PtdIns, or PtdGro. Specificity of the assay was confirmed by control experiments with erythrocytes, which showed minimal vesicle binding, and with annexin V, which blocked the binding of PtdSer, PtdGro, and PtdIns vesicles to the THP-1 cells. However, O-phospho-L-serine (to 1 mM) had no effect on the binding of PtdSer vesicles, indicating that high affinity binding requires a surface containing multiple phosphoserine groups rather than a single molecule. A monoclonal antibody to CD36 blocked up to 60% of the specific binding of PtdSer vesicles but had minimal to no effect on the binding of PtdGro or PtdIns vesicles. This antibody also selectively inhibited the phagocytosis of PtdSer-containing vesicles as measured by fluorescence microscopy, indicating that CD36 is functionally significant for phagocytosis of this vesicle type. In addition, collagen and thrombospondin, two other putative ligands of CD36, were unable to inhibit the binding of PtdSer vesicles. We conclude that CD36 is the primary protein responsible for the high affinity binding of PtdSer vesicles to these monocyte-like cells. In addition, CD36 appears to be specific for PtdSer among anionic phospholipids, and non-phospholipid ligands of CD36 do not share binding sites with PtdSer on CD36.","['Tait, J F', 'Smith, C']","['Tait JF', 'Smith C']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7110, USA. tait@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Phosphatidylglycerols)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Phospholipids)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CD36 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphatidylglycerols/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.5.3048 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)88088-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jan 29;274(5):3048-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.5.3048.,['HL-47151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia cells from spleens of leukemic rats were transplanted into young male Fischer 344 rats, producing signs of leukemia in approximately 2-3 months. The animals were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups (108/group) as follows: 1) 10 G (1.0 mT) linearly polarized 60 Hz magnetic fields, 2) sham exposed [null energized unit with residual 20 mG (2 microT) fields], 3) ambient controls [<1 mG (0.1 [microT)], and 4) positive controls (a single 5 Gy whole body exposure to 60Co 4 days prior to initiation of exposure). All rats were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with 2.2 x 10(7) LGL leukemic cells at the initiation of exposure or sham exposure. The magnetic fields were activated for 20 h/day, 7 days/week, allowing time for animal care. The experimental fields were in addition to natural ambient magnetic fields. Eighteen rats from each treatment group were bled, killed, and evaluated at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 weeks of exposure. Peripheral blood hematological endpoints, changes in spleen growth, and LGL cell infiltration into the spleen and liver were measured to evaluate the leukemia progression. No significant or consistent differences were detected between the magnetic field exposed groups and the ambient control group, although the clinical progress of leukemia was enhanced in the positive control animals. These data indicate that exposure to sinusoidal, linearly polarized 60 Hz, 10 G magnetic fields did not significantly alter the clinical progression of LGL leukemia. Furthermore, the data are in general agreement with previous results of a companion repeated-bleeding study in which animals were exposed for 18 weeks.","['Morris, J E', 'Sasser, L B', 'Miller, D L', 'Dagle, G E', 'Rafferty, C N', 'Ebi, K L', 'Anderson, L E']","['Morris JE', 'Sasser LB', 'Miller DL', 'Dagle GE', 'Rafferty CN', 'Ebi KL', 'Anderson LE']","['Bioelectromagnetics Group, Battelle, Richland, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,"['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Liver/pathology', '*Magnetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Spleen/cytology']",,1999/01/23 19:27,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/23 19:27'],"['1999/01/23 19:27 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/23 19:27 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1999)20:1<48::AID-BEM7>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(1999)20:1<48::aid-bem7>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1999;20(1):48-56. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(1999)20:1<48::aid-bem7>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress in diagnosis, physiology, and etiopathogenesis of CD5+ malignancies has been made, particularly in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The low-level expression of surface immunoglobulin has been explained by the mutations that occur in the associated CD79b.

In all gnathostomes there appear to be two main embryonic locations derived from the early mesoderm, both intra- and extraembryonic, which contribute to primitive and definitive hematopoiesis based upon their differential expression of SCL, Gata-1, Gata-2 and myeloblastosis oncogene (c-myb). In teleosts, a unique intraembryonic location for hematopoietic stem cells termed the intermediate cell mass (ICM) of Oellacher appears to be responsible for primitive or definitive hematopoiesis depending upon the species being investigated. In Xenopus, elegant grafting studies in combination with specific molecular markers has led to a better definition of the roles that ventral blood islands and dorsal lateral plate play in amphibian hematopoiesis, that of primitive and definitive lymphopoiesis. After the early embryonic contribution to hematopoiesis, specialized tissues must assume the role of providing the proper microenvironment for T and B-lymphocyte development from progenitor stem cells. In all gnathostomes, the thymus is the major site for T-cell maturation as evidenced by strong expression of developmental markers such as Ikaros, Rag and TdT plus expression of T-cell specific markers such as T-cell receptor beta and lck. In this respect, several zebrafish mutants have provided new insights on the development of the thymopoietic environment. On the other hand, the sites for B-cell lymphopoiesis are less clear among the lower vertebrates. In elasmobranchs, the spleen, Leydig's organ and the spiral valve may all contribute to B-cell development, although pre-B cells have yet to be fully addressed in fish. In teleosts, the kidney is undeniably the major source of B-cell development based upon functional, cellular and molecular indices. Amphibians appear to use several different sites (spleen, bone marrow and/or kidney) depending upon the species in question.","['Hansen, J D', 'Zapata, A G']","['Hansen JD', 'Zapata AG']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland. hansen@bii.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Amphibians/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Body Temperature Regulation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Fishes/*immunology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Mesoderm', 'Vertebrates/immunology']",159,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01264.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1998 Dec;166:199-220. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01264.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specificity and antitumor effects of the conjugates were examined in vitro and in vivo using TAA-positive bovine B-cell lymphoma line as the target tumor. In vitro studies with the TAA-positive cell line indicated that luciferase gene-containing cationic liposomes associated with the c143 anti-TAA monoclonal antibody caused about 2-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with cationic liposomes having no antibody, and also that the c143-conjugated cationic liposomes containing pLTR-DT exerted selective growth-inhibitory effects on the TAA-positive B-cell line. Three injections of pLTR-DT-containing cationic liposomes coupled with c143 into tumor-bearing nude mice resulted in significant inhibition of the tumor growth. The antitumor potency of the c143-conjugated cationic liposomes containing pLTR-DT was far greater than that of normal mouse IgG-coupled cationic liposomes containing pLTR-DT as assessed in terms of tumor size. These results suggest that cationic liposomes bearing c143 are an efficient transfection reagent for BLV-infected B-cells lymphoma cells, and that the delivery of the pLTR-DT gene into BLV-infected B-cells by the use of such liposomes may become a useful technique for gene therapy of bovine leukosis.","['Tana', 'Watarai, S', 'Onuma, M', 'Aida, Y', 'Kakidani, H', 'Kodama, H', 'Yasuda, T']","['Tana', 'Watarai S', 'Onuma M', 'Aida Y', 'Kakidani H', 'Kodama H', 'Yasuda T']","['Department of Cell Chemistry, Okayama University Medical School.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (diphtheria toxin fragment A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cations', 'Cattle', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/pathology/*therapy', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/*genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505099800167 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00516.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1998 Nov;89(11):1202-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00516.x.,,PMC5921722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transmembrane PTPepsilon (PTPepsilonM) and cytosolic PTPepsilon (PTPepsilonC) were encoded by a single gene. 5' RACE analysis and RNase protection assay showed that the mRNA of each PTPepsilon isoform was transcribed from different promoters. The putative promoter regions of two alternative first exons lacked a TATA box, but contained potential recognition sites for several transcription factors. Reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that PTPepsilonC mRNA was up-regulated during interleukin 6-induced differentiation of murine leukemia M1 cells, whereas PTPepsilonM mRNA was down-regulated. With the use of luciferase as a reporter gene, the promoter activities of the 5'-flanking regions were examined during phorbol myristate acetate-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. In the differentiated HL-60 cells, the activity of the PTPepsilonC promoter, but not that of PTPepsilonM, was dramatically elevated. Furthermore, we found that PTPepsilonC mRNA is highly expressed in mouse peritoneal macrophages and enhanced during activation by lipopolysaccharide.

The importance of these processes has, this year, been exemplified by the phenotypes of mice deficient in key signal transduction proteins and the discovery that mutations in the component proteins of some signalling pathways are linked to human diseases.

In multiple-wounded monolayers of bovine microvascular endothelial (BME) cells, an increase in mRNA and total protein for both alpha5 and beta1 subunits was observed, and this could be correlated with a reduction in cell density but not proliferation, both of which are induced following wounding. Although as previously reported, the alpha5 subunit was increased when cells were exposed to TGF-beta1 alone, co-addition of bFGF and TGF-beta1 resulted in a striking synergistic induction of alpha5, with no significant changes in the expression of beta1. In contrast, the alpha5 subunit was decreased by LIF in bovine aortic endothelial but not in BME cells.

Several studies have suggested that RTX toxins kill target cells by the induction of apoptosis. In the present study, BL3 bovine leukaemia cells were exposed to LKT and assessed by molecular and flow cytometric techniques that measure different aspects of apoptotic cell death. The intoxicated cells demonstrated morphological, light scatter and Hoechst 33258 staining characteristics consistent with cells undergoing apoptosis. The cells also exhibited internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, both indicators of apoptosis. LKT-treated cells bound annexin-V-FITC indicating that phosphatidylserine groups were translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. The effect of LKT on cells was dose dependent and inhibitable by incubation with anti-LKT monoclonal antibody. Finally, an early step for induction of apoptosis appears to be the binding of LKT to a beta2 integrin since pre-incubating cells with anti-beta2 integrin antibodies inhibited LKT-induced apoptosis.

The variant cells also showed resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as well as NO donors, but not to anti-tumor drugs. We found that HL-NR6 cells when compared with HL-60 cells possessed twice the activities of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and catalase, but no change in Mn-SOD nor in glutathione peroxidase. Immunoblotting confirmed the high levels of both enzymes in the variant cell. We also observed that ROS generation following DETA/NO exposure was substantially higher in HL-60 cells than in HL-NR6 cells, using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorometric method. Moreover, the SOD mimetic Mn(III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin and exogenous catalase effectively attenuated DETA/NO-elicited DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells. Taken together, these data suggested that the NO resistance in HL-NR6 cells is associated with the increased Cu,Zn-SOD/catalase and that NO-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells is correlated with the generation of ROS and derived molecules like peroxynitrite.","['Yabuki, M', 'Kariya, S', 'Ishisaka, R', 'Yasuda, T', 'Yoshioka, T', 'Horton, A A', 'Utsumi, K']","['Yabuki M', 'Kariya S', 'Ishisaka R', 'Yasuda T', 'Yoshioka T', 'Horton AA', 'Utsumi K']","['Department of Cell Chemistry, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Catalase/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(98)00203-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00203-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1999 Feb;26(3-4):325-32. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00203-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 30 hematopoietic cell lines were composed of 4 cell lines derived from the patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), 3 from Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Ph1+ALL), 8 from acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 3 from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), 8 from chronic myeloid leukemia at blast crisis (CML-BC), 3 from Burkitt's lymphoma and one from follicular cell lymphoma. The expression of CD80 or CD86 was frequent on cell lines derived from the patients with CML-BC or Burkitt's lymphoma, while it was rare on cell lines from T-ALL. Subsequently we analyzed the cells obtained from 48 patients with hematological malignancies, which consisted of 6 samples from patients with ALL, 30 from AML, 2 from CML-BC, 3 from B-cell lymphoma and one from each acute mixed leukemia (AMixL), adult T cell leukemia (ATL), T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL leukemia), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-RAEB in T, multiple myeloma (MM) or T-cell lymphoma. Among all the 48 cases, all cases except one case with CLL and two with B cell lymphoma were demonstrated to be negative for CD80 on the neoplastic cells. CD86 and HLA-DR were shown to be expressed in 50% and 88% of total 48 cases respectively. In 30 AML samples, CD86 was positive in 15 cases (50%), which was sharply in contrast with the finding that CD80 was not detected in any AML samples. HLA-DR was expressed in 25 AML samples (83%). We also treated seven human hematopoietic cell lines with IFN-gamma, IL-12 or IL-15 and observed whether these cytokines could induce or enhance the expression of CD40, CD54, CD58 and HLA-DR as well as CD80 and CD86. The present study demonstrated that the expression of CD86 could be upregulated not only by IFN-gamma, but also by IL-12 or IL-15 in some cell lines. These findings suggested the possibility that the absence of CD80 on neoplastic cells may be associated with the lack of efficient anti-tumor immunity in most patients with hematological malignancies and that the immuno or immuno-gene therapy manipulating the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 may be a useful treatment modality for hematological malignancies.","['Zheng, Z', 'Takahashi, M', 'Aoki, S', 'Toba, K', 'Liu, A', 'Osman, Y', 'Takahashi, H', 'Tsukada, N', 'Suzuki, N', 'Nikkuni, K', 'Furukawa, T', 'Koike, T', 'Aizawa, Y']","['Zheng Z', 'Takahashi M', 'Aoki S', 'Toba K', 'Liu A', 'Osman Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Tsukada N', 'Suzuki N', 'Nikkuni K', 'Furukawa T', 'Koike T', 'Aizawa Y']","['First Dept. of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Niigata University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Blast Crisis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Sep;17(3):251-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+ cells were positively selected by means of avidin-biotin immunoaffinity columns (Ceprate SC) or immunomagnetic beads (Isolex 300i) systems. Evaluation of minimal residual disease was performed by PCR analysis of the IgH gene rearrangment on the apheresis product before and after selection. Our results showed that after CY a median of 3.6 x 10(6)/kg (0.5-12.8) CD34+ cells were collected with a median of two aphereses in 14 out of 17 patients; three failed to mobilize a number of CD34+ cells adequate for subsequent manipulation. We found that in CR patients CD34+ cell yield per apheresis was significantly higher than in PR patients (P < 0.05). Sixteen selection procedures were performed in 13 patients. CD34+ cell recovery was 33.5% (10-85) with a median final yield of 1 x 10(6)/kg CD34+. Two patients underwent marrow collection due to the low number of CD34+ cells recovered.

GCs cause cell death in certain types of lymphoid cells mediated by the process known as apoptosis. This cell death is completely inhibited by Bcl-2. Here we report that Bcl-2 and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by GC, while acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO), an inhibitor of the caspase-3 family proteases, does not. This suggests that the inhibition by Bcl-2 and activation of some initiator caspases are upstream events of mitochondrial damage, whereas the activation of caspase-3 family proteases occurs downstream of mitochondrial changes. We also demonstrate that caspase-6 but not caspase-3 is cleaved and activated during GC-mediated apoptosis and that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a substrate of caspases, also undergoes proteolysis. In addition, we provide the evidence that DNA fragmentation is markedly inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO, while cell death, assessed by the damage of the plasma membrane, is marginally inhibited or merely delayed.","['Miyashita, T', 'Nagao, K', 'Krajewski, S', 'Salvesen, G S', 'Reed, J C', 'Inoue, T', 'Yamada, M']","['Miyashita T', 'Nagao K', 'Krajewski S', 'Salvesen GS', 'Reed JC', 'Inoue T', 'Yamada M']","[""Department of Genetics, National Children's Medical Research Center, Tokyo, Japan. tmiyashita@nch.go.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400442 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1998 Dec;5(12):1034-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400442.,['CA72994/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the physiological inhibitor of calpain, calpastatin, was found to be cleaved in three different apoptotic systems. The 110-120 kDa calpastatin protein of Jurkat T-lymphocytes and U937 monocytic leukemia cells was cleaved to a 65-70 kDa form after the induction of apoptosis with anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody, staurosporine or TNF. Cleavage of calpastatin in apoptotic cells occurred simultaneously with the cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The caspase inhibitors VAD-cmk and IETD-fmk prevented calpastatin cleavage in all three systems. Calpain inhibitor I, however, suppressed calpastatin cleavage only during TNF-induced apoptosis. Other protease inhibitors, such as lactacystin and pepstatin A, did not confer any significant protection against apoptotic calpastatin cleavage. The results from in vitro incubations with cell lysates and purified enzymes showed that calpain I, calpain II and recombinant caspase-3, all cleaved calpastatin, with varying efficiency. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that caspases may cleave calpastatin and thus, regulate calpain activity during apoptotic cell death.","['Porn-Ares, M I', 'Samali, A', 'Orrenius, S']","['Porn-Ares MI', 'Samali A', 'Orrenius S']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

METHODS: Clinical audit over a 12-month period of all new referrals with arterial disease to the vascular outpatients department at the Leicester General Hospital. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-two patients had at least one blood test performed at their outpatient visit. All of these patients had a full blood count performed, of which 21 results (21%) were abnormal. Further investigation of patients with abnormal results revealed one case of bladder cancer, one case of leukaemia and one patient with polycythaemia. Urea and electrolytes were measured in 269 patients (99%). Of these, 26 (10%) were expectedly abnormal in patients with known renal impairment. A further 27 patients (10%) were identified to have some degree of unrecognised renal impairment. Serum non-fasting glucose was measured in 252 patients (93%). There were 11 unexpectedly raised results, but further investigation of these patients only diagnosed one of these patients as diabetic. Serum cholesterol was measured in 201 patients (74%). One hundred and thirty-two patients (66%) had an abnormally raised serum cholesterol level. Of these, only 12 patients (6%) were known to have hyperlipidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Screening new patients with arterial disease in vascular outpatients does identify significant abnormalities, in particular renal impairment and hyperlipidaemia. Correction of these abnormalities may reduce the morbidity associated with contrast induced nephrotoxic acute renal failure, and also contribute to secondary prevention of vascular events associated with raised lipids.","['Pararajasingam, R', 'Nasim, A', 'Sutton, C', 'Dennis, M J', 'Bell, P R', 'Sayers, R D']","['Pararajasingam R', 'Nasim A', 'Sutton C', 'Dennis MJ', 'Bell PR', 'Sayers RD']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Leicester General Hospital NHS Trust, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,9512728,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Arterial Occlusive Diseases/blood/*complications', '*Blood Cell Count/economics', '*Blood Chemical Analysis/economics', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', '*Diagnostic Tests, Routine/economics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/complications/diagnosis', 'Kidney Diseases/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Referral and Consultation']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1078-5884(98)80243-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1078-5884(98)80243-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg. 1998 Dec;16(6):513-6. doi: 10.1016/s1078-5884(98)80243-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a multiparameter approach that integrates clinical features, morphologic features, phenotype, and genetics techniques allows for a confident separation of lymphomas from lymphoid hyperplasia in most cases. By morphologic features, formation of a mass, tissue architectural effacement, cellular monomorphism, cytologic atypia, presence of proliferation centers, and plasma cells containing Dutcher bodies are all features of low-grade B-cell lymphomas. Demonstration of immunoglobulin light chain restriction or of an aberrant B-cell phenotype are immunologic features that help to support a malignant diagnosis. Because of technical limitations and ambiguity regarding the significance of small B-cell clones, the roles of the Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction techniques to demonstrate clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or various chromosomal translocations must be evaluated further as potential criteria for malignancy. As more molecular techniques are applied to low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, more of the steps in lymphomagenesis are being defined, and the critical molecular events that predict adverse clinical outcome have yet to be discovered. Therefore, more studies are required to search for additional molecular markers that define adverse outcome so that the number of cases of borderline small B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders can be minimized.","['Kurtin, P J']",['Kurtin PJ'],"['Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",66,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Jan;111(1 Suppl 1):S119-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phospholipid activities, such as lipid composition and transportation, contribute to cellular homeostasis in the lifespan of cells. Alterations in phospholipids result in the movement of bilayer lipids and the initiation of coagulation, recognition and internalization. Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) exerts antitumor potencies and represents a new class of antitumor agents targeted to the cellular membrane. Human myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K562 employed in this study were inhibited by HePC in vitro. The results indicate that the HL-60 cell line was sensitive, while K562 was resistant to HePC. Synthetic HePC is an alkyllysophospholipid analog which interacted with the cell membrane, thereby altering lipid composition and metabolism of membrane phospholipids and modulating intracellular calcium in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 and K562 cell lines. The contents of membrane phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), were determined quantitatively with high performance liquid chromatography. The sensitivity of myeloid leukemia HL-60 and K562 cell lines to HePC probably depends on the different distribution of these four phospholipids in the cellular membrane, or on the response of these phospholipids to HePC. The cytosolic free calcium ([Ca++]i) concentration increased by HePC confirmed that [Ca++]i was released from the intracellular calcium pool and is associated with cell differentiation and apoptosis. We investigated the hypothesis that the antiproliferative effect of HePC was mediated through the interference with cellular membrane phospholipids, including choline-containing phospholipids (PC), aminophospholipids (PE and PS) and PI, in eukaryotic cells.","['Wang, Y Z', 'Chang, Y B', 'Xing, C', 'Fu, D']","['Wang YZ', 'Chang YB', 'Xing C', 'Fu D']","['Institute of Radiation Medicine of AMMS, Beijing, China. wangyz@nic.bmi.ac.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Tissue React,International journal of tissue reactions,8302116,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytosol', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Tissue React. 1998;20(3):101-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a significant increase of FEN-1 protein was observed when temporarily quiescent fibroblasts were induced to proliferate by serum stimulation. In contrast, the FEN-1 mRNA level showed a sharp decrease in HL-60 cells differentiated by dimethyl-sulfoxide, all-trans retinoic acid or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These results demonstrate that the FEN-1 gene expression is up-regulated during entrance into the mitotic cell cycle and down-regulated in nongrowing cells, as in the case of differentiated promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['Kim, I S']",['Kim IS'],"['Department of Natural Sciences Chemistry Section, Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ikim@cmc.cuk.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Flap Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.- (FEN1 protein, human)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*genetics', 'Flap Endonucleases', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/emm.1998.37 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 1998 Dec 31;30(4):252-6. doi: 10.1038/emm.1998.37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since O2- is generated by NADPH-oxidase, we examined the effect of calyculin A pretreatment on oxidase activation in response to various agonists. When Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells were treated with calyculin A prior to the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), O2- production was inhibited; however, calyculin A enhanced O2- production by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). The decreased O2- production seen with calyculin A pretreatment followed by PMA may be due to diminished translocation of the p47-phox and p67-phox, cytosolic components of the oxidase, and inhibition of arachidonic acid release. Interestingly calyculin A pretreatment followed by either agonist significantly enhanced mitogen-activated-protein kinase (MAPK) activity. The differential effects of pretreatment with calyculin A on subsequent oxidase stimulation elicited by FMLP or PMA provide further evidence for substantial heterogeneity in the activation of the respiratory burst.","['Park, J I', 'Uhlinger, D J', 'Chung, B S', 'Kim, I H', 'Kwak, J Y']","['Park JI', 'Uhlinger DJ', 'Chung BS', 'Kim IH', 'Kwak JY']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Pusan, Korea. jipark@seunghak.donga.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '7D07U14TK3 (calyculin A)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Marine Toxins', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,1999/01/23 00:00,1999/01/23 00:01,['1999/01/23 00:00'],"['1999/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/emm.1998.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 1998 Dec 31;30(4):214-20. doi: 10.1038/emm.1998.31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An easy method of estimating numerical densities of cells or particles within a tissue.,489-500,"OBJECTIVE: A new parametric method is presented, called ""square sampling,"" which speeds up the estimate of the number of cells or particles that are randomly distributed within a tissue. STUDY DESIGN: The principle of square sampling is subdivision of a biopsy into at least 100 squares of the same size using a measuring ocular or computer-based morphometric system and estimating the cell number by counting ""positive"" squares, squares with at least one cell of interest, assuming a binomial distribution of positive squares, depending on numerical density. RESULTS: The derived estimate yielded almost identical results when compared with the exact count of pseudo-Gaucher cells within bone marrow biopsies from untreated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (r = .97, examined area = 94 x 2 mm2, with 400 squares/2 mm2), but (1) the total time of investigation could be halved by square sampling (25.1 versus 55.3 hours, P < .00005), and (2) the estimated number of cells did not very more widely around the mean exact count than the cell numbers exactly counted (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Square sampling is an easy, fast and effective alternative to nonparametric approaches in order to quantify the numerical density of cells randomly distributed within a tissue. The method can also be applied to test hypotheses of random distribution as well as to quantify a clustering of cells in cases of nonrandom cell distribution.","['Busche, G', 'Schlue, J', 'Georgii, A']","['Busche G', 'Schlue J', 'Georgii A']","['Pathologisches Institut der Medizinischen Hochschule, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Count/*methods', 'Humans']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 1997 Dec;19(6):489-500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mutations in heterogeneous samples might not be detected because of the diluting effect of DNA from normal background cells. Even if a mutation were detected, it could not be traced back to a specific cell type. Molecular analysis of single cells circumvents this problem. Both mechanical and laser assisted methods have been described for the selective procurement of cells from histology slides; however, they have the drawback of either being technically demanding or expensive. Furthermore, it is nuclear whether they can be applied to cytology specimens. Finally, few of these techniques are able to procure single cells. Therefore, we developed a simplified combined microdissection and aspiration device for the rapid procurement of single cells from clinical cytology specimens. The principle of this device, called the cytopicker, is the combination of the microdissection tool, a steel cannula, with the aspiration tool, a glass capillary connected to a vacuum, into one device. Steel cannulae are optimal for microdissection of cells from the hard matrix of cytology specimens but aspirate poorly. On the other hand, glass capillaries are suboptimal for dissecting but aspirate very well. Combining both tools into one by inserting the capillary into the cannula allows optimal dissection using the cannula (with the glass capillary with-drawn and thus protected), followed by optimal aspiration using the capillary (after being advanced through the cannula). All movements of the device are controlled by just one micromanipulator, making the cytopicker inexpensive to manufacture. The cytopicker can rapidly and simply procure single cells, such as lymphoblasts, from cytology specimens, such as peripheral blood smears. DNA from these cells can be amplified by PCR. However, precautions have to be taken to avoid contamination. Once improved further, the cytopicker might facilitate molecular analysis in the routine cytology laboratory.","['Beltinger, C P', 'Debatin, K M']","['Beltinger CP', 'Debatin KM']","['Universitats-Kinderklinik Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,['0 (fas Receptor)'],IM,"['Blood Specimen Collection/*instrumentation/methods', 'Cell Separation/*instrumentation/methods', 'Dissection/*instrumentation/methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Suction/instrumentation/methods', 'fas Receptor/genetics']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.51.4.233 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 1998 Aug;51(4):233-6. doi: 10.1136/mp.51.4.233.,,PMC395645,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleotide excision repair (NER), which represents one of the most important cellular DNA repair processes able to remove a broad spectrum of DNA lesions, is involved in the recognition and repair of the crosslinks caused by DDP and melphalan (L-PAM). In this study, the mRNA levels of the different genes involved in NER (ERCC1, XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF) were examined in a panel of eight different human cancer cell lines, together with the overall DNA repair capacity using a host cell reactivation assay of a damaged plasmid. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the relative expression of XPA/XPC (P < 0.05) and ERCC1/XPC (P < 0.05) mRNAs. No correlation was found between the DDP and L-PAM IC50S and the relative mRNA expression of the tested NER genes. When the overall cellular DNA repair capacity was studied, carcinomas seemed to have a higher repair activity than leukaemias; but this repair DNA activity correlated neither with the mRNA expression of the different NER genes nor with DDP and L-PAM IC50S. These data seem to suggest that even if the NER pathway is an important determinant for the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents, as demonstrated by the extremely high sensitivity to alkylating agents in cells lacking this repair system, other factors have to play a role in regulating the cellular sensitivity/resistance to these antitumour drugs.","['Damia, G', 'Guidi, G', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Damia G', 'Guidi G', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', '*DNA Repair', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804998001907 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00190-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1998 Oct;34(11):1783-8. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00190-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the conventional chemotherapeutic agents daunorubicin, etoposide and mitoxantrone, TBZ caused equal or even greater cytotoxicity in HL60R than in HL60, and this result was associated with a more marked induction of apoptosis in the drug resistant cells. The antitumour activity of TBZ occurred in the range of concentrations higher than those required to exert antiviral activity.

This was carried out using a series of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against polymorphic and monomorphic class I and class II antigens, as well as to the transferrin receptor and assessed by flow cytometry and direct and indirect immunofluorescence. The expression of these molecules was assessed as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). The results showed that cells from all 13 individuals expressed monomorphic class I antigens. The number of cases expressing polymorphic HLA-Bw6, -Bw4, -B7, -B27 and -A2 class I antigens on CD5- B cells was 11 (85%), 6(46%), 2(15%), 1(8%), 3 (23%), respectively, which was consistent with the expected population frequency distributions of these antigens. For each of the class I antigens on CD5+ and CD5- B cells, the ratio of the MFI was greater than 1 in 12 of 13 cases. For the transferrin receptor (CD71), this ratio was also almost always greater than 1. These results indicate that, unlike solid tumours where the loss or abnormal expression of class I and II antigens is a frequent event, the expression of class I antigens in CLL patients seems to be normal. This indicates that the loss of these antigens cannot provide the leukaemic cells with a selective advantage to escape immunological detection.","['Nouri, A M', 'Smith, S', 'Oliver, T R', 'Newland, A C', 'Macey, M G']","['Nouri AM', 'Smith S', 'Oliver TR', 'Newland AC', 'Macey MG']","['Department of Medical Oncology, London Hospital Medical College, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804998001580 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00158-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1998 Sep;34(10):1618-22. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00158-0.,,,,,,,,,['Eur J Cancer 1999 Apr;35(4):678'],,,,,,,,

It is likely that they are involved in the initiation and maintenance of normal hematopoiesis. A conceptual model is proposed by which disruption of these different genes leads to the development of acute leukemia. Central to this model is the functional interaction between the mammalian trithorax and polycomb group protein complexes. Many of the genes identified in leukemia-associated translocations are likely upstream regulators, co-participators or downstream targets of these complexes. In the natural state, these proteins interact with each other to form multimeric higher-order structures, which sequentially regulate the development of the normal hematopoietic state, either through HOX gene expression or other less defined pathways. The novel interaction domains acquired by the chimaeric fusion products subvert normal cellular control mechanisms, which result in both a failure of cell maturation and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways. The mechanisms by which these translocation products are able to affect these processes are thought to lie at the level of chromatin-mediated transcriptional activation and/or repression. The stimuli for proliferation and development of clinically overt disease may require subsequent mutations in more than one oncogene or tumor suppressor gene, or both. A more comprehensive catalogue of mutation events in malignant cells is therefore required to understand the key regulatory networks that serve to maintain multipotentiality and in particular the modifications which initiate and coordinate commitment in differentiating hematopoietic cells. We propose a model in which common pathways for leukemogenesis lie along the cell cycle control of chromatin structure in terms of transcriptional activation or repression. A clearer understanding of this cascade will provide opportunities for the design and construction of novel biological agents that are able to restore normal regulatory mechanisms.","['Saha, V', 'Young, B D', 'Freemont, P S']","['Saha V', 'Young BD', 'Freemont PS']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK. v.saha@mds.qmw.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem Suppl,Journal of cellular biochemistry.

This is particularly true with regard to the acute leukemias, many of which are caused by fusion proteins that have been created by chromosomal translocations. Genetic rearrangements that disrupt the retinoic acid receptor-alpha and acute myeloid leukemia-1 genes create fusion proteins that block terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells by repressing transcription.

Dual-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting was employed to develop a model of bone cell development in primary cultures of normal human bone cells (NHBCs) based on the cell surface expression of the stromal precursor cell marker STRO-1 and the osteoblastic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Cells expressing the STRO-1 antigen exclusively (STRO-1+/ALP-), were found to exhibit qualities preosteoblastic in nature both functionally by their reduced ability to form a mineralized bone matrix over time, as measured by calcium release assay, and in the lack of their expression of various bone-related markers including bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and parathyroid hormone receptor based on reverse trancriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The majority of the NHBCs which expressed the STRO-1-/ALP+ and STRO-1-/ALP- phenotypes appeared to represent fully differentiated osteoblasts, while the STRO-1+/ALP+ subset represented an intermediate preosteoblastic stage of development. All STRO-1/ALP NHBC subsets were also found to express the DNA-binding transcription factor CBFA-1, confirming that these cultures represent committed osteogenic cells. In addition, our primer sets yielded four distinct alternative splice variants of the expected PCR product for CBFA-1 in each of the STRO-1/ALP subsets, with the exception of the proposed preosteoblastic STRO-1+/ALP- subpopulation. Furthermore, upon re-culture of the four different STRO-1/ALP subsets only the STRO-1+/ALP- subpopulation was able to give rise to all of the four subsets yielding the same proportions of STRO-1/ALP expression as in the original primary cultures. The data presented in this study demonstrate a hierarchy of bone cell development in vitro and facilitate the study of bone cell differentiation and function.","['Gronthos, S', 'Zannettino, A C', 'Graves, S E', 'Ohta, S', 'Hay, S J', 'Simmons, P J']","['Gronthos S', 'Zannettino AC', 'Graves SE', 'Ohta S', 'Hay SJ', 'Simmons PJ']","['Matthew Roberts Laboratory, Leukemia Research Unit, Hanson Center for Cancer Research, I.M.V.S., Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Density/physiology', 'Bone Development/*physiology', 'Bone Matrix/cytology/growth & development/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteogenesis/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Reference Values', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1999.14.1.47 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1999 Jan;14(1):47-56. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1999.14.1.47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 15 and 25% of IEL could be stained with an antibody to CD95L. Therefore it was investigated whether the CD95L/CD95 pathway was effective in IEL cytotoxicity. Stimulation of IEL in vitro with concanavalin A (Con A) induced a strong cytotoxic response, which was much higher when using CD95-expressing target cells. This effect was most evident when comparing the specific lysis of CD95-transfected target cells of the leukaemia cell line L1210 with that of the untransfected parental cell line. In addition, an antibody to CD95 was able to dramatically reduce the specific lysis of CD95-expressing target cells. After stimulation with Con A, which is able to bind to CD95L, the effects were more obvious compared with the triggering of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-alphabeta or gamma delta. On the other hand, EGTA reduced the Con A-induced cytotoxicity. Together these findings support a role of the CD95L/CD95 pathway in IEL cytotoxicity, even though the reaction was Ca2+ sensitive. As a function, CD95L-expressing IEL should be able to contribute to the elimination of CD95-expressing target cells in the intestine.","['Ghoreschi, K', 'Muders, M', 'Enders, G A']","['Ghoreschi K', 'Muders M', 'Enders GA']","['Institute for Surgical Research, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/*immunology', 'Intestine, Small', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1998.00638.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 1998 Dec;95(4):566-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1998.00638.x.,,PMC1364353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is secreted by anterior pituitary cells and stimulates both basal and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-stimulated ACTH secretion in AtT20 cells. To determine the effects of LIF on normal pituitary cells, we measured the effects of LIF and an immunoneutralizing antiserum against LIF on ACTH secretion by cultured sheep anterior pituitary cells. In intact populations of anterior pituitary cells, LIF (10 nM) stimulated ACTH secretion (from 0.30 +/- 0.06 to 0.77 +/- 0.01 ng/well per 3 h) and antiserum to LIF (by itself) had no effect (0.29 +/- 0.05 ng/well per 3 h). In marked contrast, following pharmacological elimination of CRH-target cells, a condition known to disinhibit ACTH secretion, basal ACTH secretion was elevated (0.74 +/- 0.13 ng/well per 3 h); LIF produced no further stimulation (0.73 +/- 0.22 ng/well per 3 h) but immunoneutralization of LIF significantly reduced secretion to 0.50 +/- 0.10 ng/well per 3 h. Medium, conditioned by exposure to CRH-target-depleted cultures of anterior pituitary cells, increased net ACTH secretion (from 0.29 +/- 0.03 to 6.54 +/- 0.71 ng/well per 3 h), when added as a challenge to naive, cultured anterior pituitary cells. Inclusion of antiserum to LIF significantly attenuated (5.29 +/- 0.62 ng/well per 3 h) this response. The presence in and secretion of LIF by normal individual pituitary cells was detected using immunocytochemical methods. Seven to 8% of all cells stained positively for LIF, with 66 +/- 11% of those secreting detectable amounts of LIF under unstimulated conditions. LIF colocalized with TSH and LH in pituitary cells. Taken together, these data suggest that LIF can stimulate ACTH secretion by normal anterior pituitary cells, and potentially plays a role as an intrapituitary stimulator of ACTH secretion under certain conditions.","['Schwartz, J', 'Ray, D W', 'Perez, F M']","['Schwartz J', 'Ray DW', 'Perez FM']","['Department of Obstetrics, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., USA. schwartz@medcenter.wpmail.wfu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Neuroendocrinology,Neuroendocrinology,0035665,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Sheep']",,1999/01/20 03:02,2001/07/04 10:01,['1999/01/20 03:02'],"['1999/01/20 03:02 [pubmed]', '2001/07/04 10:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 03:02 [entrez]']","['54401 [pii]', '10.1159/000054401 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroendocrinology. 1999 Jan;69(1):34-43. doi: 10.1159/000054401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic Searches of Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EM-BASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and Sociofile were undertaken. All references of articles selected were searched for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of personal, focused, committed and organised intercessory prayer on behalf of anyone with a health problem were considered. Outcomes such as achievement of desired goals, death, illness, quality of life and well-being for the recipients of prayer, those praying and the caregivers were sought. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were reliably selected and assessed for methodological quality. Data were extracted by 4 reviewers working independently. Dichotomous data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and continuous data with over 50% completion rate are presented. MAIN RESULTS: There was no evidence that prayer affected the numbers of people dying from leukaemia or heart disease (OR 0.64, CI 0.32-1.27), or that it decreased coronary care complications (OR 1.05, CI 0.49-2.26) or the time participants stayed in hospital. There were significantly fewer 'intermediat//poor outcomes' for those with heart disease in the prayed-for group (OR 0.49, CI 0.30-0.80), and this finding was robust to some changes in definition. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides no guidance for those wishing to uphold or refute the effect of intercessory prayer on the outcomes studied in the available trials. Therefore, in the light of the best available data, there are no grounds to change current practices. There are very few completed trials of the value of intercessory prayer. The evidence presented so far is interesting enough to justify further study. If prayer is seen as a human endeavour it may or may not be beneficial, and further trials could uncover this. It could be the case that any effects are due to elements beyond present scientific understanding that will, in time, be understood. If any benefit derives from God's response to prayer it may be beyond any such trials to prove or disprove.","['Roberts', 'Ahmed I', 'Hall', 'Sargent', 'Adams']","['Roberts L', 'Ahmed I I', 'Hall S', 'Sargent C', 'Adams C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Forsch Komplementarmed,Forschende Komplementarmedizin,9440428,,,,,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['nef81113 [pii]', '10.1159/000057115 [doi]']",ppublish,Forsch Komplementarmed. 1998;5 Suppl S1:82-86. doi: 10.1159/000057115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we sought to determine whether molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene could contribute to the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants. Primary leukemic cells were freshly obtained from 12 infants (<1 year of age) with newly diagnosed ALL. In leukemic cells from each of the 12 infants with ALL, we found high level expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from seven of seven infants with ALL, including five of five MLL-AF4(+) infants, expressed dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8 that lack critical N-terminal zinc fingers. In six of seven patients, we detected a specific mutation leading to an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (Delta KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the transcription activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers of Ik-2, Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8. In contrast, only wild-type Ik-1 and Ik-2 isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicate the expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.","['Sun, L', 'Heerema, N', 'Crotty, L', 'Wu, X', 'Navara, C', 'Vassilev, A', 'Sensel, M', 'Reaman, G H', 'Uckun, F M']","['Sun L', 'Heerema N', 'Crotty L', 'Wu X', 'Navara C', 'Vassilev A', 'Sensel M', 'Reaman GH', 'Uckun FM']","[""Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Children's Cancer Group ALL Biology Reference Laboratory, Departments of Genetics, Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.2.680 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jan 19;96(2):680-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.2.680.,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC15196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known, however, about how these complexes target specific genes for activation. We now have purified a specialized SWI/SNF-related complex (PYR complex) from murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell nuclear extract that binds pyrimidine-rich elements at the human and murine beta-globin loci. PYR complex DNA-binding activity is restricted to definitive hematopoietic cells and is both DNA sequence- and length-dependent. Mass spectrometric identification of purified peptides and antibody supershift assays indicate that PYR complex contains at least four known mammalian SWI/SNF subunits: BAF57, INI1, BAF60a, and BAF170. PYR complex broadly footprints a 250-bp pyrimidine-rich element between the human fetal and adult beta-globin genes. A short intergenic deletion that removes this element from a human globin locus cosmid construct results in delayed human fetal-to-adult globin gene switching in transgenic mice. Taken together, the data suggest that PYR complex may act through this intergenic element to facilitate human fetal-to-adult globin gene switching, presumably by opening the locus in the region of the adult genes to permit the binding of beta-globin transcriptional activators.","[""O'Neill, D"", 'Yang, J', 'Erdjument-Bromage, H', 'Bornschlegel, K', 'Tempst, P', 'Bank, A']","[""O'Neill D"", 'Yang J', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Bornschlegel K', 'Tempst P', 'Bank A']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-51-9 (Hemoglobin A)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/genetics', 'Genes, Switch/*genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobin A/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.2.349 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jan 19;96(2):349-54. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.2.349.,"['DK25274/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL28381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC15139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As most mHags are not leukemia specific but are also expressed by normal tissues, antileukemia reactivity is often associated with life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we describe a novel mHag, HB-1, that elicits donor-derived CTL reactivity in a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patient treated by HLA-matched BMT. We identified the gene encoding the antigenic peptide recognized by HB-1-specific CTLs. Interestingly, expression of the HB-1 gene was only observed in B-ALL cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells. The HB-1 gene-encoded peptide EEKRGSLHVW is recognized by the CTL in association with HLA-B44. Further analysis reveals that a polymorphism in the HB-1 gene generates a single amino acid exchange from His to Tyr at position 8 within this peptide. This amino acid substitution is critical for recognition by HB-1-specific CTLs. The restricted expression of the polymorphic HB-1 Ag by B-ALL cells and the ability to generate HB-1-specific CTLs in vitro using peptide-loaded dendritic cells offer novel opportunities to specifically target the immune system against B-ALL without the risk of evoking GVHD.","['Dolstra, H', 'Fredrix, H', 'Maas, F', 'Coulie, P G', 'Brasseur, F', 'Mensink, E', 'Adema, G J', 'de Witte, T M', 'Figdor, C G', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade, E']","['Dolstra H', 'Fredrix H', 'Maas F', 'Coulie PG', 'Brasseur F', 'Mensink E', 'Adema GJ', 'de Witte TM', 'Figdor CG', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade E']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. h.dolstra@chl.azn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HMHB1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,1999/01/20 00:00,1999/01/20 00:01,['1999/01/20 00:00'],"['1999/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.189.2.301 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 Jan 18;189(2):301-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.189.2.301.,,PMC2192993,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors studied 134 hospitalized pancytopenic patients in Zimbabwe in both consecutive and nonconsecutive fashion. RESULTS: The most common cause of pancytopenia was megaloblastic anemia, followed by aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and hypersplenism. Severe pancytopenia was usually due to aplastic anemia. Patients with aplastic anemia and acute leukemia were usually children, whereas those with megaloblastic anemia were adults. Moderate to severe anemia was noted throughout the series, but was most striking in patients with megaloblastic anemia, aplastic anemia, and acute leukemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was elevated in most patients with megaloblastic hematopoiesis, aplastic anemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Normal or low MCV values were noted in almost one third of patients with megaloblastic anemia. Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, macroovalocytosis, microcytosis, fragmentation, and teardrop erythrocytes were more prominent on the blood films of patients with megaloblastic anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Megaloblastic anemia, aplastic anemia, and AIDS are the most common causes of pancytopenia in Zimbabwe. Aplasia is the most frequent cause of severe pancytopenia. The authors have formulated tentative guidelines for the evaluation of pancytopenic patients in this setting.","['Savage, D G', 'Allen, R H', 'Gangaidzo, I T', 'Levy, L M', 'Gwanzura, C', 'Moyo, A', 'Mudenge, B', 'Kiire, C', 'Mukiibi, J', 'Stabler, S P', 'Lindenbaum, J']","['Savage DG', 'Allen RH', 'Gangaidzo IT', 'Levy LM', 'Gwanzura C', 'Moyo A', 'Mudenge B', 'Kiire C', 'Mukiibi J', 'Stabler SP', 'Lindenbaum J']","['Department of Haematology, University of Zimbabwe School of Medicine, Harare. savage@cuccfa.ccc.columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism/complications', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/*diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Zimbabwe']",,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)40466-5 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-199901000-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 1999 Jan;317(1):22-32. doi: 10.1097/00000441-199901000-00004.,"['AG-09834/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-21365/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most recently discovered member of the family, MRP6, is analyzed in this report. The MRP6 gene is located on chromosome 16, immediately next to MRP1, and encodes a protein of 1503 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of Mr 165,000. The 3' end of the MRP6 protein was found to be almost identical with the anthracycline resistance associated (ARA) protein identified previously in epirubicin-selected leukemia cells. Using both 3'- and 5'-derived MRP6 probes, we found that MRP6 is highly expressed in liver and kidney and to a low or very low extent in a few other tissues. No evidence was obtained for an independent expression of the ARA part of the MRP6 gene in normal tissues. To assess a possible role for MRP6 in multidrug resistance, we examined a large panel of resistant cell lines for the (over)expression of MRP6. We found overexpression of the complete MRP6 gene or part of it only in those cell lines with high overexpression and amplification of the MRP1 gene. DNA blot (Southern) analysis showed that MRP6 or a part of it is also amplified in these cell lines. Our results suggest that MRP6 does not play a role in the resistance of the resistant cells analyzed, and that MRP6/ARA is only coamplified with MRP1 because of its location immediately next to it on the same chromosome.","['Kool, M', 'van der Linden, M', 'de Haas, M', 'Baas, F', 'Borst, P']","['Kool M', 'van der Linden M', 'de Haas M', 'Baas F', 'Borst P']","['Division of Molecular Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment']",,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jan 1;59(1):175-82.,,,['GENBANK/AF076622'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound is cytotoxic to P388 leukemia cells, but not to P388CPT5 camptothecin-resistant cells having a deficient topoisomerase I. R-3 can behave both as a specific topoisomerase I inhibitor trapping the cleavable complexes and as a nonspecific inhibitor of a DNA-processing enzyme acting via DNA binding. In addition, the drug is a potent inhibitor of the kinase activity of topoisomerase I. Unlike camptothecin, R-3 completely inhibits the phosphorylation of SF2/ASF, a member of the SR protein family, in the absence of DNA. The inhibitory effect is also observed using mutant enzyme Y723F that lacks DNA cleavage/religation activity but does not affect phosphotransferase activity, indicating, therefore, that R-3 acts independently at both DNA cleavage and protein kinase sites. R-3 is the only compound known thus far that interferes specifically with the kinase activity of topoisomerase I and not with other kinases, such as protein kinase C and the cdc2 kinase. The study reinforces the view that topoisomerase I is a dual enzyme with a DNA cleavage site juxtaposed to a functionally independent kinase site and shows for the first time that indolocarbazole drugs can inhibit both the DNA cleavage/religation and kinase activities of the enzyme.","['Labourier, E', 'Riou, J F', 'Prudhomme, M', 'Carrasco, C', 'Bailly, C', 'Tazi, J']","['Labourier E', 'Riou JF', 'Prudhomme M', 'Carrasco C', 'Bailly C', 'Tazi J']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, Universite de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Carbazoles/*toxicity', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Indoles/*toxicity', 'Mice', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jan 1;59(1):52-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of MM patients and human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular techniques has shown IGH rearrangements in 75% of MM cases and in up to 100% of HMCL. A review of the literature revealed at least 18 different partner chromosomal regions. To investigate whether some of these translocations were recurrent and possibly to identify new partner regions, we developed a set of FISH probes to detect every IGH recombination. We analyzed 28 MM and 4 primary PCL patients with abnormal karyotypes and 12 HMCL. Whereas conventional cytogenetics detected a 14q32 abnormality in only 15% of the patients, FISH detected it in 47% of patients and in 75% of HMCL. The partner chromosome was identified in 10 of 15 patients with a 14q32 rearrangement. Interestingly, the same t(4; 14)(p16;q32) was detected in five patients and three HMCL, i.e., 33% of patients and HMCL with an IGH rearrangement. New partner chromosomal regions have also been identified, i.e., 9p13, 12p11, 12p13, and Xq28, besides the previously reported 8q24, 11q13, 12q24, and 16q24 rearrangements. The genes involved in these new translocations are not known, except for 9p13, where PAX5 was shown to be the partner gene. We conclude that: I) IGH recombinations are frequent but not constant in MM, 2) these rearrangements often occur through cryptic translocations, and 3) the t(4;14)(p16;q32) is one of the most frequent translocations, but many other chromosomal regions may be involved.","['Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Brigaudeau, C', 'Morineau, N', 'Talmant, P', 'Lai, J L', 'Daviet, A', 'Li, J Y', 'Praloran, V', 'Rapp, M J', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Facon, T', 'Bataille, R']","['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Brigaudeau C', 'Morineau N', 'Talmant P', 'Lai JL', 'Daviet A', 'Li JY', 'Praloran V', 'Rapp MJ', 'Harousseau JL', 'Facon T', 'Bataille R']","['Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/immunology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/19 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/19 03:02'],"['1999/01/19 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/19 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199901)24:1<9::AID-GCC2>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199901)24:1<9::aid-gcc2>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999 Jan;24(1):9-15. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199901)24:1<9::aid-gcc2>3.0.co;2-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TNF-alpha mRNA steady state levels and TNF-alpha secretion in the presence of specific pharmacological agents were monitored using rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) stimulated through FcepsilonRI. Relative amounts of TNF-alpha mRNA versus beta-actin levels were quantified by RNase protection and RT-PCR assays. TNF-alpha secretion was measured by a current ELISA test. RESULTS: We show that EGTA (5 mM) prevented TNF-alpha mRNA expression and TNF-alpha secretion in antigen-stimulated cells. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I substantially blocked TNF-alpha secretion at 2 microM but had only a marginal effect on TNF-alpha mRNA expression. The results were similar when PKC isoforms were depleted by long-term exposure to 100 nM phorbol ester (PMA). The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin blocked TNF-alpha secretion at low doses (EC50= 13 nM), but only partially affected mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in FcepsilonRI-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells calcium mobilization, activation of PKC and PI 3-kinase are necessary for TNF-alpha secretion while for the increased TNF-alpha mRNA expression PKC activity is dispensable and PI 3-kinase activity only partially required.","['Pelletier, C', 'Guerin-Marchand, C', 'Iannascoli, B', 'Marchand, F', 'David, B', 'Weyer, A', 'Blank, U']","['Pelletier C', 'Guerin-Marchand C', 'Iannascoli B', 'Marchand F', 'David B', 'Weyer A', 'Blank U']","[""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Further phenotypic characterization of the MDS clone may lead to negative selection of these cells or positive selection of normal stem cells as part of an autotransplant strategy, as is presently being done in chronic-phase chronic myeologenous leukemia. The use of agents such as the topoisomerase I inhibitors (e.g., topotecan), which have mechanisms of action disparate from agents already used in MDS, may increase the efficacy of chemotherapy for MDS.

It is perhaps disappointing that, after so many studies, so many questions remain. Nevertheless, the role of cytokines in induction therapy seems to be established, although questions remain around the issue of priming therapy. Intriguing data regarding the potential for enhancing antimicrobial function should hopefully be resolved over the next few years. What is perhaps most reassuring is that the issue of safety, which for a considerable period of time precluded the development of clinical trials in acute leukemia, has been firmly laid to rest. The use of growth factors to protect normal stem cells during treatment of leukemia and to induce leukemic cell differentiation has not yet been the subject of many clinical trials. Also, growth factors are likely targets for the interruption of autocrine leukemic blast or progenitor cell growth, but again, few clinical observations are published. With the ongoing cloning of new growth factors active both in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis, the role of growth factor use in the treatment of AML will likely be the basis for much future preclinical and clinical activity.","['Rowe, J M', 'Liesveld, J L']","['Rowe JM', 'Liesveld JL']","['Hematology Institute, Rambam Medical Ce2nter, Hifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'S Phase']",129,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-0-585-38571-6_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 1999;99:195-226. doi: 10.1007/978-0-585-38571-6_8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critical advances include: The molecular delineation of atypical APL cases with alternative RAR alpha fusion partners, and the demonstration that cells from 2 of the 3 types of 'atypical' APL retain sensitivity to ATRA. Perhaps the key question is why such cases are so rare. However, at a minimum, the presence of such cases argues persuasively that disruption of the retinoid signaling pathway is a (perhaps the) key pathogenetic feature of APL. Although certainly not 'passive' partners, it is likely that PML, PLZF, NPM, and NuMA serve similar functions in the pathogenesis of APL. The demonstration, in transgenic mice, that PML-RAR alpha (and PLZF-RAR alpha) can disrupt normal hematopoiesis and, given sufficient time, cause an APL-like syndrome. the variation in phenotype of the mice, which appears to be a consequence of the specific expression vector used, emphasizes the cell-type-specific nature of PML-RAR alpha function. Continuing functional analysis of PML, PLZF, and RAR alpha. In particular, the demonstration that PML and PLZF can form heterodimers provides a critical functional link between these proteins and offers a tantalizing glimpse at how both, when linked with RAR alpha, can cause APL. The demonstration that PML-RAR alpha is degraded, perhaps via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway, in response to ATRA. This result offers a unifying, if not yet proven, hypothesis to explain the sensitivity of leukemic promyelocytes to ATRA. Unfortunately, it is not known if ATRA can also cause degradation of NPM-RAR alpha or NuMA-RAR alpha (atypical cytogenetic APL variants that retain ATRA responsiveness). Whether PML-RAR alpha degradation is a cause, or consequence, of promyelocytic maturation remains unclear. Continuing insight into retinoid resistance, including the first demonstration of mutations in the PML-RAR alpha molecule from ATRA-resistant patients. The definitive demonstration that the two major PML-RAR alpha isoforms, while having subtle differences in biological activity and producing slightly different APL phenotypes, nevertheless do not, in and of themselves, have prognostic significance in patients treated with ATRA/chemotherapy combinations. Further functional analysis of PML-RAR alpha in vitro. The fascinating finding that PML-RAR alpha is cytotoxic to most cell types suggests that it must function as an oncogene in a very specialized milieu. In addition, the demonstration that both the DBD (from RAR alpha) and dimerization interface (from PML) are required for full in vitro functional activity, coupled with the finding that PML itself is a strong transcriptional suppressor, suggests that PML-RAR alpha may directly repress transcription of RA target genes. The challenge in APL research now is to integrate the above findings into a cohesive, unifying model that explains the biology of APL at a molecular level. The creation and validation of such a model will clarity whether APL is a fortunate medical curiosity or whether it will serve as a paradigm for the development of effective differentiation therapies in other types of human cancers.","['Slack, J L', 'Gallagher, R E']","['Slack JL', 'Gallagher RE']","['Department of Medicine Roswell, Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/chemistry/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/chemistry/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",215,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-0-585-38571-6_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 1999;99:75-124. doi: 10.1007/978-0-585-38571-6_4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequence of the first 92 amino acids (ending with the conserved Gly-Gly) of mouse SMT3A exhibited two differences at amino acid no. 38 and 76 in comparison with that of human SMT3A. The C-terminal 18 amino acid sequence of mouse SMT3A was completely different from the C-terminal 11 amino acid sequence of human SMT3A. Mouse and human SMT3B were identical for a sequence of 95 amino acids. Mouse SMT3A genomic DNAs were amplified by polymerase-chain-reaction and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a PCR-amplified SMT3A genomic DNA fragment was found to be identical to that of SMT3A cDNA, indicating the absence of intron(s) in its protein coding region. Another genomic DNA fragment of 1,531 nucleotides, containing 7% differences from that of cDNA, is unable to encode a functional protein, and thus, it is a SMT3A processed pseudogene. Three mouse SMT3B processed pseudogenes were cloned and sequenced. The genuine mouse SMT3B gene has not yet been isolated. Mouse SMT3A transcript of 1.8 kb was predominantly expressed in most tissues, while SMT3B transcript of 1.0 kb was abundantly present in all tissues analyzed. A family of ubiquitin-like proteins was recently discovered. One distinguishing feature of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins is the capacity to conjugate with other proteins post-translationally. The ubiquitin-like proteins are cleaved endoproteolytically after a diglycine sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal Gly75-Gly76 of ubiquitin. The cleavage activates the molecule for conjugation. The yeast SMT3 gene was originally identified as a suppressor of mutations in MIF2 gene, which encodes an essential protein binding to the A+T-rich CDEII region of centromere DNA (1). Studies using temperature-sensitive mutants showed that the loss of yeast Mif2 protein function results in chromosome missegregation, mitotic delay, and aberrant microtubule morphologies (2). The yeast Mif2 protein shares at least two regions of similarity with mammalian centromere protein CENP-C, an integral component of active kinetochores (3, 4). Human SMT3A cDNA was identified from the genome sequencing project of chromosome 21 (5). We have cloned human SMT3B (formerly designated as HSMT3) cDNA (6). Human SMT3C protein was independently isolated by several groups and denoted as SUMO-1 (7), GMP1 (8), PICI (9), UBL1 (10), sentrin (11). SUMO-1/GMP1 was found to be covalently linked to the Ran GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1, and attachment of SUMO-1 targets the otherwise cytosolic RanGAP1 to the nuclear pore complex. The modified form of RanGAP1 also appeared to associate with the mitotic spindle apparatus during mitosis (7, 8). PIC1 was shown to interact with the PML component of nuclear multiprotein complex that is disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia (9).

The cytolysis induced by cecropin peptides was more effective for the cancer cells than for the normal cells. Based on the observations from scanning electron microscopy, this may mainly due to the cancer cells having a high population of the irregular microvilli on the cell surface.

Although classical methods for proliferative assessment such as tritiated thymidine or BrdUrd incorporation, are correlated with treatment outcome, they are time consuming and difficult to standardize. As an alternative, we have evaluated the use of a dye dilution method using PKH26 to determine rate and extent proliferation in drug sensitive and resistant cell lines. When cells labelled with this fluorescent membrane intercalating dye divide, each resulting daughter cell receives half of the dye. Using flow cytometric analysis, it is possible to estimate the number of cells having undergone different numbers of cell divisions. Four different questions were addressed in these studies: a) does PKH26 give stable and reproducible labelling? b) does labelling with PKH26 alter cellular proliferation characteristics? c) is PKH26 a substrate for PGP and MRP? d) does PKH26 labelling alter PGP expression and/or PGP activity? We found that PKH26 labelling is stable, reproducible and has no effect on cell proliferation. It does not modify PGP activity or expression, nor does it appear to be a substrate for PGP or MRP, since the rate of decrease in fluorescence intensity is similar for sensitive and resistant cells which are proliferating at the same rate. Using the dye dilution method, it is possible to simultaneously assess PGP, proliferative status, and level of PGP expression. We conclude that the methods developed here provide a simpler, more complete means for assessment of the effects of the drug therapy on sensitive and resistant cell populations in patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Boutonnat, J', 'Muirhead, K A', 'Barbier, M', 'Mousseau, M', 'Ronot, X', 'Seigneurin, D']","['Boutonnat J', 'Muirhead KA', 'Barbier M', 'Mousseau M', 'Ronot X', 'Seigneurin D']","['Equipe de Cytologie Quantitative, Institut Albert Bonniot, La Tronche France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (PKH 26)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', '*Organic Chemicals']",,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Nov-Dec;18(6A):4243-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also appears that patients with malignancy and thrombosis are relatively refractory to warfarin therapy and some may not respond ideally to heparin preparations. Occult malignancy in patients with unexplained thrombosis is of concern; however, the incidence varies with the age of the patient approaching 10% in those over 50 years of age. The extent of the evaluation for an underlying occult malignancy should be dictated by clinical judgment. Recurrent unexplained DVT, resistance to warfarin, and thrombosis of unusual sites are the major clues to significantly enhance the suspicion of an occult malignancy. In general, patients with thrombosis and malignancy need not be evaluated for hereditary or acquired hemostasis defects; finding one of these defects is both unlikely and will probably not alter antithrombotic therapy. Hemorrhage in cancer patients is usually due to thrombocytopenia related to chemotherapy (particularly solid tumors) or bone marrow failure (usually leukemias), or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is usually seen in M-3 and M-4 leukemia or in septic patients with solid tumors. Finally, catheter thrombosis is a common problem in patients with cancer and can be significantly decreased with the routine use of low-dose warfarin therapy.","['Frenkel, E P', 'Bick, R']","['Frenkel EP', 'Bick R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-8852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,['5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)'],IM,"['Catheterization/adverse effects', 'Hemorrhage/*complications/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/complications/diagnosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombophilia/complications', 'Thrombosis/*complications/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Warfarin/therapeutic use']",35,1999/01/19 00:00,1999/01/19 00:01,['1999/01/19 00:00'],"['1999/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1998 Nov-Dec;12(6):625-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most extensively characterized import pathway, often termed the classical pathway, is utilized by many basic-type (lysine-rich) NLSs and requires an additional component, importin alpha, to serve as a bridge between the NLS and the import receptor importin beta. More recently, it has become clear that a variety of proteins enter the nucleus via alternative import receptors and that their NLSs bind directly to those receptors. By using the digitonin-permeabilized cell system for protein import in vitro, we have defined the import pathway for the Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Interestingly, the arginine-rich NLS of Rex uses importin beta for import but does so by a mechanism that is importin alpha independent. Based on the ability of the Rex NLS to inhibit the import of the lysine-rich NLS of T antigen and of both NLSs to be inhibited by the domain of importin alpha that binds importin beta (the IBB domain), we infer that the Rex NLS interacts with importin beta directly. In addition, and in keeping with other receptor-mediated nuclear import pathways, Rex import is dependent on the integrity of the Ran GTPase cycle. Based on these results, we suggest that importin beta can mediate the nuclear import of arginine-rich NLSs directly, or lysine-rich NLSs through the action of importin alpha.","['Palmeri, D', 'Malim, M H']","['Palmeri D', 'Malim MH']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Group, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6148, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ran GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/chemistry', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Karyopherins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'ran GTP-Binding Protein']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.2.1218 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Feb;19(2):1218-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.2.1218.,"['5-F31-HG-00065/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI41933/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC116051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although not detected in normal lymphocytes, c-Mer is expressed in B- and T-cell leukemia cell lines, suggesting an association with lymphoid malignancies. To gain an understanding of the role of this receptor in lymphoid cells, we expressed in murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 pro-B-lymphocyte cells a constitutively active receptor, CDMer, formed from the CD8 extracellular domain and the c-Mer intracellular domain. Cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the CDMer receptor became IL-3 independent. When tyrosine (Y)-to-phenylalanine (F) mutations were introduced into c-Mer, only the Y867 change significantly reduced the IL-3-independent cell proliferation. The Y867 residue in the CDMer receptor mediated the binding of Grb2, which recruited the p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Despite the difference in promotion of proliferation, both the CDMer and mutant F867 receptors activated Erk in transfected cells. On the other hand, we found that both transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and activation of PI 3-kinase were significantly suppressed with the F867 mutant receptor, suggesting that the activation of antiapoptotic pathways is the major mechanism for the observed phenotypic difference. Consistent with this notion, apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal was strongly prevented by CDMer but not by the F867 mutant receptor.","['Georgescu, M M', 'Kirsch, K H', 'Shishido, T', 'Zong, C', 'Hanafusa, H']","['Georgescu MM', 'Kirsch KH', 'Shishido T', 'Zong C', 'Hanafusa H']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Mertk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Hematopoietic System/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.2.1171 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Feb;19(2):1171-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.2.1171.,['CA44356/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC116046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON) transfected cell lines, Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP) was identified as the ligand of RON. RON is synthesized as a single chain precursor, which subsequently is cleaved to yield a disulfide-linked heterodimer, with a 40-kDa alpha chain and a 150-kDa beta chain. Activation of RON by MSP results in cell migration, shape change, and proliferation. The present work centers on the production and characterization of two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to RON called ID-1 and ID-2. Antibodies were generated by immunization of mice with Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells expressing human RON (clone RE7). Both antibodies recognized the mature and precursor form of RON. The specificity of the anti-RON antibodies was confirmed using a hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 expressing both task MET and RON receptors. Specific immunoprecipitation with ID-1 and ID-2 or anti-MET antibody followed by Western blotting under reducing conditions with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RON and MET showed that our anti-RON antibodies recognize specifically the RON receptor. Ligand binding experiments showed that both antibodies are able to block the binding of radiolabeled MSP to RON and showed also that the antibodies recognize two different epitopes in the molecule. The blocking of MSP binding to RON by the anti-RON antibodies was confirmed by inhibition of cell migration induced by MSP in HT-29-D4 cells. Significant immunostaining was not observed in any subpopulation of whole blood with either ID-1 or ID-2. We analyzed the expression of RON receptor in a number of human hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells lines by flow cytometry. We found a strong mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI) in colon adenocarcinoma cells SW620 and HT-29-D4, low MFI in SVK14 and HepG2 cells, and no immunostaining in melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that RON was expressed in germinal centers of tonsil, in skin, small intestine, and colon.

Cells originally adapted to vincristine are also extremely resistant to doxorubicin. Resistance to both vincristine and doxorubicin is connected with depression of drug uptake. While resistance of L1210 cells to vincristine could be reversed by verapamil as chemosensitizer, resistance of cells to doxorubicin was insensitive to verapamil. Action of verapamil (well-known inhibitor of PGP activity) on multidrug resistance was often used as evidence that MDR is mediated by PGP. From this point it may be possible that the resistance of L1210/VCR cells to vincristine is mediated by PGP and the resistance to doxorubicin is mediated by other PGP-independent system. Another and more probable explanation of different effect of verapamil on resistance of L1210/VCR cells to vincristine and doxorubicin may be deduced from the following fact: Using UV spectroscopy we found that doxorubicin dissolved in water buffered medium interacts effectively with verapamil. This interaction may be responsible for the decrease of concentration of both drugs in free effective form and consequently for higher survival of cells. In contrast to doxorubicin vincristine does not give any interaction with verapamil that is measurable by UV spectroscopy and resistance of L1210/VCR cells to vincristine may be fully reversed by verapamil.","['Breier, A', 'Drobna, Z', 'Barancik, M']","['Breier A', 'Drobna Z', 'Barancik M']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/analysis/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/analysis/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1998;45(4):248-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of T-ALL patients at diagnosis were estimated. Cell surface markers were detected by a standard immunofluorescence assay and FACStar flow cytometry using a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies to define T-cell immunophenotype. DPP IV activity was investigated in phenotypically defined T-lymphoblasts. Association between DPP IV expression and proliferation was monitored by the expression of CD71 and CD38, which could be considered as markers of activation and proliferation, and by the silver-staining of nucleolar organizer regions-related proteins (argyrophilic proteins). Lymphoblasts, divided according to the presence or absence of DPP IV activity revealed remarkable heterogeneity in the immunophenotypic features. The vast majority of DPP IV positive T-ALL cases expressed CD4, CD8, CD7, CD5, CD2 along with CD71 and CD38 antigens, but the cells were surface membrane CD3 antigen negative. The phenotype of DPP IV negative cases displayed membrane CD3 antigen and variable expression of CD4 and CD8. CD71 and CD38 were frequently negative. It appears, that DPP IV active cells form the population with immature phenotype, as evidenced by mCD3 antigen absence. Relation between DPP IV positive cells and proliferation activity of T-blasts was observed, given by the presence of CD71 and CD38 positivity and overexpression of argyrophilic proteins (AgNORs). In conclusion, our study indicates a close relationship between DPP IV activity and the features ofT-cell immaturity. Association among DPP IV, CD71, CD38 and AgNORs might reflect possible relationship between immature phenotype and proliferative ability of blast cells in T-ALL patients.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Receptors, Transferrin']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1998;45(4):237-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic cells demonstrate unique cytokine receptor profiles, which reveal the great diversity of immunophenotypes within the main functional characterization of blood malignancies. The immunophenotype heterogeneity of leukemic cells has proved to be much greater than to match with existing classification criteria.

To assess the specificity of the action of AG957, we have examined its effect in another tyrosine kinase-mediated system, anti CD-3-stimulated Jurkat T Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells. We also compared the effects of AG957 with those of geldanamycin, which can disrupt tyrosine kinase signaling through binding to heat shock protein (hsp90), and two geldanamycin analogs, 17-amino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AG) and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG). At concentrations found to produce 90% inhibition of Jurkat T-cell growth, AG957 within 4 hr of addition inhibited mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and activity, as shown by a decreased anti CD-3-stimulated erk-2 mobility shift in lysates of treated cells and a decrease in the stimulated myelin basic protein peptide kinase activity in erk-2 immunoprecipitates, respectively. AG957 did not inhibit this activity when added directly to immunoprecipitates. Effects in cells were found to be accompanied by a decrease in the anti CD-3-stimulated phosphorylation of p120cbl. Under conditions of a similar degree of growth inhibition, geldanamycin initially did not inhibit MAP kinase activation. Geldanamycin analogs did not decrease anti CD-3-induced cbl phosphorylation, but did reduce basal p120cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. The action of AG957 occurred with an apparent shift of several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to apparent higher molecular weights, which also did not occur with the geldanamycins. These results suggest that growth inhibition by AG957 can alter tyrosine kinase signaling systems unrelated to p210(bcr-abl) with a prominent early effect on MAP kinase activation in T-lymphoblasts. AG957 and geldanamycin affect tyrosine kinase signaling by distinct mechanisms.","['Losiewicz, M D', 'Kaur, G', 'Sausville, E A']","['Losiewicz MD', 'Kaur G', 'Sausville EA']","['Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Section, Laboratory of Drug Discovery Research and Development, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (tyrphostin AG957)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Antibodies/blood', 'Benzoquinones', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295298002937 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00293-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Feb 1;57(3):281-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00293-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late breakthrough bacteraemias with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused 50% of all fatal infections. The analysis suggests that no patients died during initial bacteraemia with penicillin-resistant organisms treated with penicillin/aminoglycoside. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria was favourable compared to what has been found in other countries. For the time being, we believe that the ecological advantages of using penicillin/aminoglycoside as initial empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia are greater than the disadvantages.","['Hammerstrom, J', 'Jacobsen, T']","['Hammerstrom J', 'Jacobsen T']","['Medisinsk avdeling, Regionsykehuset i Trondheim.']",['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Penicillins)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bacteremia/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/drug therapy', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Penicillin Resistance', 'Penicillins/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 1998 Nov 20;118(28):4370-5.,,,,Bakteriemi ved granulocytopeni--mikrobiologi og empirisk antibiotikabehandling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF may have chemotactic activity through the induction of IL-8 production. LIF is produced by normal and tumoral cells and appears to facilitate in vivo rat colon carcinoma cells growth. Inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis (UC) in particular, are histologically characterized by the infiltration of the colonic mucosa with activated neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. Cytokines with their inflammatory as well as their regulatory activities may play a role in the perpetuation and possibly the initiation of inflammation in this disease and its local and/or systemic complications. Moreover, colorectal cancer is a late well identified complication in patients with long standing inflammatory bowel disease, UC in particular. Taken together, these results suggest that LIF could be involved in tumorigenic and/or metastatic processes of colorectal cells in UC patients. The aims of the present study was to quantify and to compare the colonic and systemic productions of LIF in UC patients. We showed for the first time in patients with UC, a high local production of LIF well correlated with IL-8 production. We also analyzed the effect of LIF on a human colon carcinoma cell line HT29. We demonstrated that LIF stimulated HT29 cell growth in a dose dependent-manner.

Interestingly, sgp190 forms have been identified in large amounts in normal mouse sera but so far not in human sera. During gestation, murine sgp190 increases 20-fold to 30-fold, while sgp190 RNA levels increase mostly in the liver, uterus and placenta. Sandwich ELISAs were used to detect the presence and follow the evolution of LIF concentrations and its sgp190 receptor subunit in the sera of healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women. The LIF concentrations in whole blood of pregnant women were significantly lower than those of non-pregnant women, whereas they returned to these latter values soon after delivery. In 51 non-pregnant women, the mean sgp190 concentration was 4.3 0.3 ng/ml. It rose slowly but steadily, increasing 4-fold from the 4th to th 34th week of amenorrhea, at which time, it accelerated more rapidly until reaching 41 weeks of amenorrhea, 12 times the mean control value. Several hours prior to delivery, the sgp190 concentration dropped sharply before returning to control levels 2 days later. The marked increase of sgp190 measured in pregnant women extends to humans the observation previously made in mice and suggests a pivotal role for this cytokine system not only during implantation and early embryo development but also throughout pregnancy and more specifically in the biological function of placenta.","['Pitard, V', 'Lorgeot, V', 'Taupin, J L', 'Aubard, Y', 'Praloran, V', 'Moreau, J F']","['Pitard V', 'Lorgeot V', 'Taupin JL', 'Aubard Y', 'Praloran V', 'Moreau JF']","['Universite de Bordeaux 2, CNRS-UMR 5540, 146 rue Leo-Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Liver/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Placenta/immunology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy/*blood/*immunology', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Solubility', 'Uterus/immunology/metabolism']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1998 Dec;9(4):599-605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the target-cell specificity of fusogenic liposome (FL)-mediated macromolecule delivery into human blood cells using diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) as a probe. Among the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), FL was able to deliver its encapsulates into CD14+ monocytes and CD4-/CD8- T-cells, but not into CD19+ B-lymphocytes, CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells. The susceptibility of human leukemia cell lines to FL was similar to that of PBMC; the order of the reactivity was U937 (monoblastic leukemia)>MOLT4, Jurkat (T-lymphoma)>Daudi, BALL1 (B-lymphoma)>K562 (erythroblastic leukemia). Interestingly, FL showed similar binding activity to all of these leukemia cell lines. These findings indicate that, among blood cells, monocytes, monoblastic leukemia cells, CD4-/CD8- T-cells and T-lymphoma cells are preferable targets for FL-mediated macromolecule delivery. This is the first demonstration of the existence of non-permissive cells against FL.

Both cytokines are structurally and functionally related to a group of factors called neuropoietic cytokines, which also includes IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and oncostatin M. These factors have trophic effects on subsets of neurons. In the present study we examined the influence of CT-1 and IL-11 on newborn rat dorsal root ganglion neuron survival in vitro. Mouse CT-1 showed prominent trophic effects that were comparable to those of CNTF and LIF. Mouse IL-11 alone did not enhance neuronal survival, but soluble mouse IL-11 receptor alpha rendered neurons sensitive to IL-11. Surprisingly, soluble IL-11 receptor alpha even had slight neurotrophic effects by itself. These results suggest that CT-1 and IL-11 might also be involved in the physiological regulation of sensory neuron survival. Thus, they might, like CNTF, become tools for the therapeutic intervention in neurodegeneration due to disease, toxicity, and trauma.","['Thier, M', 'Hall, M', 'Heath, J K', 'Pennica, D', 'Weis, J']","['Thier M', 'Hall M', 'Heath JK', 'Pennica D', 'Weis J']","['Institute of Neuropathology, Technical University (RWTH), Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Mol Brain Res,Brain research.

Several observations have suggested an important role for Glvr-1 in regulated Pi handling in bone forming cells and prompted us to investigate further the molecular mechanisms regulating Glvr-1 gene expression. In addition, the regulation of Glvr-1 gene expression also has potential applications to gene therapy, since retroviral vectors carrying gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope proteins are used for gene delivery into different cell types. The aim of this study was thus to clone the human Glvr-1 gene in order to describe its structure and its promoter region. Our results indicate that the Glvr-1 gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns spread over 18kb of genomic DNA. The translation initiation site is located within exon II and the translation stop codon within exon XI. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) suggests that, in human SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cells, transcription of Glvr-1 is initiated at multiple sites, mostly located between bp 32 and 50 of the published cDNA sequence, which was initially obtained from HL-60 cells. The 5'-flanking region of the gene is characterized by a very high GC content. Reporter gene assays demonstrate the presence of a functional promoter upstream of exon I and indicate that a GC-rich region, containing two potential SP1 binding sites, is required for high promoter activity in transiently transfected SaOS-2 cells. The description of the human Glvr-1 gene structure, as well as the analysis of some structural and functional characteristics of its promoter region, provide a basis for more detailed investigation of the molecular mechanisms controlling expression of the Glvr-1 gene in bone forming cells and in other cell types.","['Palmer, G', 'Manen, D', 'Bonjour, J P', 'Caverzasio, J']","['Palmer G', 'Manen D', 'Bonjour JP', 'Caverzasio J']","['Division of Bone Diseases, WHO Collaborating Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteoblasts/physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,1999/01/16 00:00,1999/01/16 00:01,['1999/01/16 00:00'],"['1999/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(98)00572-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00572-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1999 Jan 8;226(1):25-33. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00572-1.,,,"['GENBANK/AF102059', 'GENBANK/AF102060', 'GENBANK/AF102061', 'GENBANK/AF102062', 'GENBANK/AF102063', 'GENBANK/AH007490']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibited both interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced macrophage differentiation of murine monocytic leukemic M1 cells and LIF induction of a Stat3-responsive reporter construct in 293T fibroblasts. Deletion of amino acids 51-78 in the N-terminal region of SOCS-1 prevented inhibition of LIF signaling. The SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 N-terminal regions were functionally interchangeable, but this did not extend to other SOCS family members. Mutation of SH2 domains abrogated the ability of both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 to inhibit LIF signal transduction. Unlike SOCS-1, SOCS-3 was unable to inhibit JAK kinase activity in vitro, suggesting that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 act on the JAK-STAT pathway in different ways.

Most nodal lymphomas with monocytoid B cell/marginal zone differentiation exhibit the morphologic and immunophenotypical characteristics of extranodal MALT-lymphomas. Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is also of putative marginal zone derivation, but it differs immunophenotypically from MALT lymphoma. To clarify the relationship between nodal and extranodal MZLs and to investigate the possible existence of a nodal variant of SMZL, 36 MZL initially considered to be primary nodal neoplasms were examined. Other low-grade lymphomas with marginal zone differentiation were excluded (small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia [SLL/CLL], follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma). Six nodal MZLs showed morphologic and phenotypic characteristics similar to those of SMZL, whereas 30 tumors were more similar to MALT-type lymphomas. The six tumors with SMZL features showed a polymorphic infiltrate surrounding residual germinal centers with absent or very attenuated mantle cuffs. These lymphomas were IgD positive (6/6) but cyclin D1 (0/5), CD5 (0/6), and CD23 (0/6) negative. Five of these patients came for treatment in stage I or II. No patient manifested splenomegaly, peripheral blood, and/or bone marrow infiltration either at diagnosis or during follow-up. Lymph nodes from 30 patients with MALT-type features showed a perisinusoidal and perivascular infiltration of monocytoid/centrocytoid cells and residual germinal centers with a relatively well-preserved mantle cuff. The neoplastic cells were negative for IgD (0/17), cyclin D1 (0/8), and CD5 (0/12). Seven of 16 (44%) patients with a detailed history and clinical follow-up had evidence of extranodal lymphoma.

The SCV may progress to ALCL, but little is known about the transformation process and its significance. The goals of this study were (1) to identify the clinical and pathologic features that characterize ALCL arising in SCV and (2) to determine whether some cases with ALCL histologic appearance at the outset arose from an SCV. Seventeen SCV were reviewed, and four cases (24%) transformed to ALCL as shown by subsequent biopsy. The ALCLs were predominantly monomorphic (3 cases) rather than pleomorphic (1 case). Residual SCV was detected at transformation in 3 of 4 cases. Twenty-one de novo T-cell ALCLs were reviewed for an SCV component; such a component was identified in two ALCLs with monomorphic features, suggesting a preceding SCV phase. There was no change in the immunophenotype between the SCV and ALCL, all marking as EMA+ T cells. Expression of p80 was detected in 3 of 4 (75%) SCV with transformation and 10 of 12 (77%) SCV without transformation. Chromosomal abnormalities involving the sex chromosomes and 6, 7, 9, and 15, in addition to the characteristic t(2;5)(p23;q35), were present in 2 cases at transformation. Times to transformation ranged from 1 to 146 months (mean: 63 months) after diagnosis. Transformation to ALCL signaled a rapid clinical course, with 75% of patients dying in less than a year; one patient remains alive at 15 months. In summary, some ALCLs, particularly those with monomorphic features, arise from an SCV. Transformation to ALCL signals a rapid course, with death occurring in less than a year in most cases. Necrosis in the SCV may be predictive of transformation. Chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the t(2;5)(p23;q35) are present at transformation, suggesting that multiple genetic alterations are involved in disease progression.","['Hodges, K B', 'Collins, R D', 'Greer, J P', 'Kadin, M E', 'Kinney, M C']","['Hodges KB', 'Collins RD', 'Greer JP', 'Kadin ME', 'Kinney MC']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-5310, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemistry/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/chemistry/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/chemistry/genetics/*pathology', 'Male']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199901000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1999 Jan;23(1):49-58. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199901000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter analysis has previously identified two regions, proximal and distal, within the CYP17 promoter important in the cAMP dependent transcriptional regulation of this gene. The proximal (-80 to -40) cAMP responsive sequence (CRS2) has been identified as a binding site for Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1)/Ad4BP. The distal region (-243 to -100) is also important for the cAMP transcriptional response as revealed by deletion analysis. Within this distal region from -243 to -225, an independent cAMP responsive sequence referred to as CRS1 has been described. The transcription factors binding CRS1 have been identified as homeodomain transcription factors belonging to an atypical class of homeodomain proteins referred to as TALE. Two families of homeodomain proteins which bind CRS1 are the Pbx and Meis1 families. Proteins from neither of these families can bind CRS1 individually; however, members of the Pbx family interact with members of the Meis1 family to cooperatively bind this element. CRS1 was the first identified cis-acting target element for members of both the Pbx and Meis1 family. Unlike SF-1, these proteins are not expressed in a steroidogenic tissue-specific manner but rather, appear ubiquitous. A current model for the function of these proteins in CYP17 regulation is that they may enhance the cAMP response through the downstream SF-1 binding site.","['Bischof, L J', 'Kagawa, N', 'Waterman, M R']","['Bischof LJ', 'Kagawa N', 'Waterman MR']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Endocr Res,Endocrine research,8408548,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NR5A1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '0 (steroidogenic factor 1, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.14.19 (Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase/*genetics', 'Steroidogenic Factor 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07435809809032637 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr Res. 1998 Aug-Nov;24(3-4):489-95. doi: 10.3109/07435809809032637.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunofluorescent labeling of the MCR in all cell lines showed a nucleocytoplasmic localization of the receptor whereas the ENaC was exclusively membrane-bound. These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. The expression of the MCR in HEL cells was evident as a predicted band of 843 bp (234 amino acids) after total RNA from HEL cells had been reverse transcribed and then amplified by PCR; the ENaC was similarly evident as a predicted band of 520 bp. In both cases, near 100% identity was observed between the deduced amino acid sequences of the PCR products and those from known human sources.

METHODS: Using a lacZ-producing retroviral vector, rabbit keratolimbal explants were transduced ex vivo, autografted onto their original sites, and assessed for lacZ-producing cells in the cornea throughout a 6-month period. Four autografts served as control samples, having received no vector. Experimental and control rabbits were euthanized and corneas with scleral rims harvested, weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 6 months. The corneas were first stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl galactopyranoside (X-gal) as wholemounts and then sectioned for histology and immunohistochemistry to examine lacZ-positive cell outgrowth. Three additional transduced explants were observed in culture. These explants were transferred to new culture dishes every week for 9 weeks. The previously occupied culture dish was stained for lacZ to detect transduced epithelial cells, and the number of lacZ-positive cells was quantitated. RESULTS: LacZ-positive cells were found in the corneas of 18 of 20 eyes in which virally transduced keratolimbal autografts had been implanted. The cells were epithelial in nature, originated from the limbus, and were found in colonies throughout the epithelial layer of the cornea. The appearance of lacZ-positive cells in four of five corneas harvested after 6 months showed long-term transgene expression consistent with transduction of corneal epithelial stem cells. In vitro, the number of lacZ-positive cells migrating from the keratolimbal autografts decreased rapidly during the first 4 weeks and then remained stable through week 9. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a retroviral vector can effectively transduce corneal epithelial progenitor cells, shown by the long-term appearance of transduced cells on the cornea in vivo and the stable production of lacZ-positive cells in vitro. The appearance and disappearance of labeled cells is consistent with the initial transduction of stem cells and transient amplifying cells.","['Bradshaw, J J', 'Obritsch, W F', 'Cho, B J', 'Gregerson, D S', 'Holland, E J']","['Bradshaw JJ', 'Obritsch WF', 'Cho BJ', 'Gregerson DS', 'Holland EJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Indoles)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'V595OG374W (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-galactoside)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Epithelium, Corneal/*enzymology/transplantation/virology', 'Galactosides/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Lac Operon/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*enzymology/virology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1999 Jan;40(1):230-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed two unique antibodies to human TRAP purified from hairy cell leukemia spleen. Both antibodies (9C5 and 14G6) are suitable for immunohistochemistry of osteoclasts and macrophages. Only one (14G6) is capable of immunoprecipitating active TRAP from human cell lysates. Antibody 9C5 reacts with a denatured epitope of TRAP while antibody 14G6 probably reacts with a native, conformational determinant. The high degree of homology among TRAPs of various species predicts that these antibodies should be suitable for work in experimental animals as well as humans. Immunohistochemical staining, electrophoretic analyses, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays of human rat and mouse TRAP were carried out to test the validity of these antibodies as cell markers in rodents. Both antibodies were suitable for immunohistochemistry in all species. Antibody 9C5 was suitable for immunoblotting of denatured TRAP of all species tested. Antibody 14G6 reacted with the native TRAP of humans only and failed to immunoprecipitate mouse or rat TRAP activity.

The conventional approach to treatment of acute myeloid leukemia has been the use of chemotherapy, which although being cytotoxic to malignant clones, is also cytodestructive to normal cells. In addition, some leukemia cells develop resistance to chemotherapy and are therefore difficult to eradicate. 2. Differentiation therapy, whereby immature cells are induced to attain a mature phenotype by differentiation agents, has provided an alternative strategy in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders. This has been highlighted by the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). 3. Another differentiation agent, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), directs monocytic maturation of normal and leukemic cells. Cellular studies have revealed that combinations of vitamin D derivatives and retinoids such as ATRA and 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) exhibit cooperative effects on differentiation in established leukemia cell lines such as HL-60, U937, and NB4. Furthermore, vitamin D compounds, although not able to induce apoptosis when used alone, potentiate apoptosis induced by 9-cis RA in HL-60 cells and differentially regulate the expression of the apoptosis-related gene products bcl-2 and bax. The molecular mechanisms involved in regulating differentiation and apoptosis by these agents are mediated through the interactions of the nuclear receptors for vitamin D (VDR), ATRA (RAR), and 9-cis RA (RXR), which are able to form homo- or heterodimeric complexes and transcriptionally activate or repress target gene expression. 4. There is evidence to suggest that nitric oxide may also play a role in leukemic cell differentiation and that 1,25(OH)2D3 may influence endogenous nitric oxide production either by directly increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or through a secondary mediator such as the C-type lectin CD23.","['James, S Y', 'Williams, M A', 'Newland, A C', 'Colston, K W']","['James SY', 'Williams MA', 'Newland AC', 'Colston KW']","[""Division of Gastroenterology, Endocrinology, and Metabolism, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Gen Pharmacol,General pharmacology,7602417,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",174,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0306362398000986 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-3623(98)00098-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Gen Pharmacol. 1999 Jan;32(1):143-54. doi: 10.1016/s0306-3623(98)00098-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies this treatment was efficacious in relapsed Hodgkin's disease and in ""de novo"" high-risk high-grade NHL. We tested the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of this approach, administered with simplified supportive measures, as salvage regimen for patients with relapsed (n = 17) or resistant (n = 3) lymphoma (9 high-grade NHL, 4 low-grade NHL and 7 Hodgkin's disease). The regimen included sequential administration of cyclophosphamide (7 g/m2), methotrexate (8 g/m2), etoposide (2 g/m2), mitoxantrone (60 mg/m2) and melphalan (180 mg/m2) over a period of 8 weeks in an effort to reduce hospitalisation to a minimum. Of the 20 initial patients, 15 completed the planned programme. The regimen was subjectively well tolerated despite frequent hospital stays (median 44 days). Recovery of absolute neutrophil and platelet counts after transplantation occurred on the average on days 13 and 11 respectively. A second neutrophil and platelet nadir was seen 7-8 weeks after transplantation. Long-term side effects were a severe stenosing postactinic oesophagitis and a secondary subacute monoblastic leukaemia. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2 years disease-free and overall survival are 27% and 60% respectively. Of the 15 patients actually transplanted, 7 (47%) are alive disease-free.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possibility that, in the two cell lines examined, alterations in cell growth caused by lipophilic quaternary ions may involve KATP channels. We examined the effect of tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), tetraphenylboron (TPB), rhodamine 123, dequalinium chloride (DECA) and the non-quaternary ion cisplatin on the proliferation of L1210 mouse leukaemia cells and rat smooth muscle cells in vitro. The KATP channel opener levcromakalim (LKM) and the KATP channel antagonist glibenclamide were also tested. 2. From growth-inhibition studies, the rank order of potency (based on pIC50 values) using L1210 leukaemia cells was: DECA (6.61) > cisplatin (6.09) = rhodamine 123 (6.01) > TPP (5.61) > TPB (4.25). Levcromakalim and glibenclamide were found to be inactive at the maximum concentrations used (100 mumol/L). A different rank order of potency was obtained in rat aortic smooth muscle cells: cisplatin (6.33) > DECA (5.67) > TPP (4.96) > rhodamine 123 (4.1). Tetraphenylboron (30 mumol/L), LKM (100 mumol/L) and glibenclamide (100 mumol/L) were found to be inactive. 3. When the negatively charged TPB (30 mumol/L) was combined with some of the active agents, the potency of the active agents was increased. Thus, in L1210 cells, rhodamine 123, DECA and TPP were all more potent at inhibiting cell growth in the presence of TPB. Tetraphenylboron had no effect on cisplatin in this cell line. In rat smooth muscle cells, TPB (30 mumol/L) potentiated the effect of rhodamine 123 but had no effect on the actions of cisplatin, DECA or TPP. 4. In functional studies, rhodamine 123 was a weak antagonist of the vasorelaxant responses to the KATP channel opener LKM in the porcine right circumflex artery in vitro. The pKB value obtained for rhodamine 123 at 100 mumol/L was 4.95. Dequalinium chloride was inactive. 5. We found no correlation between the actions of the compounds tested to antagonise KATP channels and their ability to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, compounds known to regulate KATP channel activity failed to influence proliferative rates. These results suggest that KATP channels are not involved in the antiproliferative action of TPP and other quaternary ions in the two cell lines studied.","['Piekarska, A E', 'Webster, L', 'Saltis, J', 'McPherson, G A']","['Piekarska AE', 'Webster L', 'Saltis J', 'McPherson GA']","['Department of Pharmacology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Potassium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '4358-26-3 (Tetraphenylborate)', '76898-47-0 (15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'E7QC7V26B8 (Dequalinium)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U9IF5Y5IND (tetraphenylphosphonium)']",IM,"['15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aorta/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Coronary Vessels/drug effects/physiology', 'Dequalinium/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/pharmacology', '*Potassium Channel Blockers', 'Rats', 'Rhodamine 123/pharmacology', 'Swine', 'Tetraphenylborate/pharmacology', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/pharmacology']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1681.1998.tb02172.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 1998 Dec;25(12):992-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.1998.tb02172.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk factors for treatment failure.,331-5,"BACKGROUND: The use of combinations of antibiotics has been the cornerstone of therapy for febrile patients with cancer and severe neutropenia. Each empirical regimen should be selected according to the epidemiology and susceptibility patterns in each center. We describe here the experience with empirical antimicrobial treatments in pediatric patients with cancer, fever and severe neutropenia, and identify the risk factors associated with treatment failure. METHODS: This is a prospective study including 145 patients with cancer, and 171 episodes of neutropenia and fever. Blood cultures were taken before initiating empirical treatment: a) carbenicillin (400 mg/kg/day) plus amikacin (21 mg/kg/day) (Cb/ak), and b) ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/day), plus amikacin at the same dosage (Cz/ak). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 54.9% and 56.3% for Cb/ak and Cz/ak, respectively. Fifty-seven episodes (33.3%) were microbiologically documented, gram-positive isolated in 38% and gram-negative in 49%. Risk factors associated significantly with treatment failure were acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) (RR 2.59, CI 95% 1.42-4.7, p = 0.003); bacteriological identification (RR = 4.41, CI 95% 2.21-8.8, p < 0.001), and the presence of two or more sites of infection (RR = 2.89, CI 95% 1.03-8.11, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The rates of response are similar to the combinations used in the hospital (Cb/ak, Cz/ak). The risk factors associated with treatment failure were AML diagnosis, bacteriological identification, and the presence of two or more sites of infection.","['Miranda-Novales, M G', 'Belmont-Martinez, L', 'Villasis-Keever, M A', 'Penagos-Paniagua, M', 'Bernaldez-Rios, R', 'Solorzano-Santos, F']","['Miranda-Novales MG', 'Belmont-Martinez L', 'Villasis-Keever MA', 'Penagos-Paniagua M', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Solorzano-Santos F']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Hospitalaria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, IMSS, Mexico, D.F.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'G42ZU72N5G (Carbenicillin)']",IM,"['Amikacin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Carbenicillin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Ceftazidime/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1998 Winter;29(4):331-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary malignant neoplasia represents one of the worst possible long-term complications, leading to death in patients cured of their primary malignancy. Patients with testicular germ cell tumors appear to have a 2-fold increased risk of developing any second cancer 25-30 years after the diagnosis, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 16-23% at that time. The risk for secondary solid tumors can be mainly attributed to radiotherapy. There is strong evidence of an increasing risk for secondary solid tumors with time since treatment. Tumor-specific analysis of the risk for second cancers revealed statistically significant excesses for stomach, pancreas, bladder, rectum, prostate, and kidney cancer, as well as for cancer of the thyroid, melanoma, sarcomas, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. No significantly elevated risk for secondary solid tumors was observed after treatment with chemotherapy alone. The risk of secondary leukemia was associated with both radiotherapy and in particular with chemotherapy. In recent clinical surveys of patients with testicular cancer, estimates of the risk of leukemia after chemotherapy have ranged from 10- to 300-fold. An elevated risk was observed within the first two decades after diagnosis, later the risk was as expected in the normal population. Etoposide seems to be leukemogenic, especially at cumulative doses higher than 2 g/m2, although the effects of dose and schedule as well as the effects of other cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy remain to be finally clarified. Based on currently available data in patients with testicular cancer, it can be concluded that a significant elevated risk for the development of secondary leukemia exits after chemotherapy. However this risk does by far not outweigh the therapeutic benefit of etoposid-based therapy in patients with germ cell tumors. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is the main late vascular toxicity affecting about one third of patients after curative chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Hypertension will occur in one fifths of the patients. The incidence of vascular toxicity appears to be lower following PEB-therapy compared to PVB-therapy and major vascular events seem to be rare. Other frequent symptomatic toxicities are ototoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. A major risk factor for the development of toxicity is the cumulative dose of cisplatin given. Alterations of gonadotropin levels and Leydig cell insufficiency persist in more than half of young patients cured from testicular cancer by cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Approximately one fourth of patients have low serum magnesium or phosphat levels, or elevated creatinine levels. These toxicities seldomly result in clinical symptoms. We conclude that 3-4 courses with bleomycin, cisplatin and etoposide in testicular cancer patients will only rarely lead to symptomatic impairment of organ functions and a decrease of quality of life. Germ cell cancers have served as a valuable model for the development of new treatment strategies contributing largely to defining the role of cisplatinum, etoposide and recently ifosfamide in medical oncology. However, germ cell cancer may also be a useful model for investigating the long term side effects of the oncological therapies. Thus, germ cell cancer is not only a ""model for a curable neoplasm"" (L.H. Einhorn) but can also be seen as a ""model for the study of late sequelae of modern oncological therapies"".","['Jakob, A', 'Kollmannsberger, C', 'Kanz, L', 'Bokemeyer, C']","['Jakob A', 'Kollmannsberger C', 'Kanz L', 'Bokemeyer C']","['Medizinische Klinik II, Eberhard-Karls-Universitat Tubingen.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Urologe A,Der Urologe.

For this purpose, the proviral retrovirus genome, engineered into the vaccinia virus mutant, was subjected to several modifications, including the replacement of retroviral promoter sequences by vaccinia virus sequences and the precise fusion of the transcription stop signal downstream of and the removal of such signals within the transcription unit, allowing cytoplasmic transcription of distinct full-length retroviral transcripts. Vaccinia-mediated expression of retroviral vector particles could be observed as early as 3 h postinfection and resulted in stable transduction of NIH/3T3 target cells at higher titers than the control performed by conventional plasmid transfections. Thus at least part of the vaccinia life cycle and retroviral assembly can occur concomitantly. Due to the favorable properties of vaccinia vectors, including high coding capacity, stability, and wide host range, defective vaccinia viral/retroviral chimeric vectors are promising tools for gene therapy applications.","['Holzer, G W', 'Mayrhofer, J A', 'Gritschenberger, W', 'Dorner, F', 'Falkner, F G']","['Holzer GW', 'Mayrhofer JA', 'Gritschenberger W', 'Dorner F', 'Falkner FG']","['Biomedical Research Center, Baxter/Hyland Immuno Division, Uferstrasse 15, Orth/Donau, A-2304, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Uracil-DNA Glycosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', '*DNA Glycosylases', 'DNA Repair', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Poxviridae/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Uracil-DNA Glycosidase', 'Vaccinia virus/enzymology/genetics', 'Virion/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99496-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9496 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Jan 5;253(1):107-14. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9496.,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The affected cells have both proliferative and functional impairment. Therefore, we evaluated and compared neutrophil function in 31 patients with polycythemia vera (PV), idiopathic myelofibrosis (MF), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and essential thrombocytosis (ET). Neutrophil chemotaxis, random migration, bactericidal activity and superoxide anion release in these patients were simultaneously compared to those of 31 healthy controls. In this study, chemotactic activity was significantly impaired in patients with PV and CML as compared to controls (M+/-SE: 42 +/- 6 vs. 69+/- 5 cells/field; p<0.005 and 47+/-7 vs. 68+/- 5; p<0.05, respectively). The assessment of the bactericidal activity of neutrophils showed no impairment in most of the patients. In the CML group, the serum had a very strong ""lytic"" effect on bacteria, possibly due to the high levels of serum lysozyme (22 +/- 2 microgram/ml). The superoxide anion release was found to be normal in most of the patients. Nevertheless, in 25% of PV patients the superoxide production was impaired (less than 60% of the simultaneous controls). In ET most patients had normal neutrophil function. Regarding the effect of treatment, neutrophil chemotactic activity was found to be significantly reduced in the hydrea-treated patients, as compared to the non- treated patients (p<0.001) or healthy controls (<0.0001). We conclude that disturbances in neutrophil function are present in patients with various MPDs, except ET. This probably reflects abnormal maturation of ancessors of the damaged stem cells. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that therapy itself could affect neutrophil functions. This matter should be studied more extensively. Although infections are not common in MPD disorders, they occasionally occur. It is possible that impairment in the phagocytic function contribute to the development of infections in patients with myeloproliferative disorders.","['Wolach, B', 'Gavrieli, R', 'Manor, Y', 'Lishner, M']","['Wolach B', 'Gavrieli R', 'Manor Y', 'Lishner M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Clinic, Meir General Hospital, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/pathology', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*pathology/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90218-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0218 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Dec;24(4):544-51. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance towards these antitumoral inhibitors was associated with decreased expression and activity of topo II, suggesting that such a decrease may be responsible for MoMLV restriction. To more specifically assess the role of topo II during the retroviral cycle, we have used the antisense strategy to obtain a selective decrease of cellular topo II expression. The RNA antisense was isolated from a retroviral library expressing random fragments of human topo II (alpha form). This system allowed us to investigate the HIV-1 replicative cycle in two related human CEM cell lines expressing different levels of topo II. Expression of the enzyme is decreased four- to sixfold following formation of a sense-antisense RNA hybrid. Repression of the topo II enzyme results in an impairment of the HIV-1 replicative cycle. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we showed that the number of integration events was decreased in cells repressing the enzyme, although viral DNA synthesis and circularization were equivalent to those in the parent cells.","['Bouille, P', 'Subra, F', 'Mouscadet, J F', 'Auclair, C']","['Bouille P', 'Subra F', 'Mouscadet JF', 'Auclair C']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie des Macromolecules Biologiques, CNRS UMR 1772, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. pbouille@igr.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(98)92360-9 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1998.2360 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1999 Jan 22;285(3):945-54. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1998.2360.,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It stimulates calcium release and growth of ovarian cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we found that LPA levels were significantly elevated in plasma from patients with ovarian cancer and other gynecological cancers. In contrast, LPA levels were not elevated in patients with breast cancer and leukemias. In view of this, we investigated whether gynecological cancer cells could produce LPA. LPA was extracted from the supernatant of cells cultured in vitro and purified by thin layer chromatography. After hydrolysis and transmethylation, the fatty acid derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography. We found that the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), significantly stimulated the production of LPA in ovarian and cervical cancer cells. In contrast, a small or negligible amount of LPA was produced in breast cancer and leukemia cells upon PMA stimulation. This cell type specificity correlates with our values of plasma LPA, suggesting that gynecological tumor cells may be an important source of the elevated LPA noted in the plasma of patients with these cancers. The cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2)/Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) inhibitor, AACOCF3, inhibited 75.6% PMA-stimulated LPA secretion in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting a cPLA2/iPLA2 activity was involved in LPA production from ovarian cancer cells.","['Shen, Z', 'Belinson, J', 'Morton, R E', 'Xu, Y', 'Xu, Y']","['Shen Z', 'Belinson J', 'Morton RE', 'Xu Y', 'Xu Y']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the Cancer Center, Department of Cancer Biology, Department of Cell Biology, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysophospholipids/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",,1999/01/15 00:00,1999/01/15 00:01,['1999/01/15 00:00'],"['1999/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090-8258(98)95193-9 [pii]', '10.1006/gyno.1998.5193 [doi]']",ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 1998 Dec;71(3):364-8. doi: 10.1006/gyno.1998.5193.,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant human 31-kDa inhibin A was iodinated by an optimized lactoperoxidase procedure. Fractionation of the labeled protein by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-100 in 0.1 M HCl yielded two immunoactive peak regions, the second of which was bioactive as assessed by in vitro bioassay, with a ratio of bioactivity/immunoactivity of 0.62-0.77 and an iodine incorporation ratio of 1.7-2.0 mol 125I/mol inhibin. The specific binding of purified [125I]inhibin to cultured ovine pituitary cells varied with time, temperature, and cell number. Displacement of the tracer by unlabeled inhibin, as assessed by Scatchard analysis, revealed two binding sites with average Kd values of 0.28 and 3.9 nM and with approximately 250 and 3100 binding sites/anterior pituitary cell, respectively. There was little cross-reaction between inhibin and activin A (<2%), transforming growth factor-beta (<0.2%), or follistatin (<<0.1%). Examination of cell lines that were not expected to have inhibin receptors showed that there was no specific binding of inhibin to human leukemia (Jurkat) cells, whereas the binding to human embryonic kidney (293) cells was displaced by both inhibin and activin with a similar degree of cross-reaction, which suggests binding to an activin receptor. It is concluded that inhibin-binding sites with high affinity and specificity have been identified on ovine pituitary cells, consistent with both inhibin action on the pituitary and the presence of the putative inhibin receptor.","['Hertan, R', 'Farnworth, P G', 'Fitzsimmons, K L', 'Robertson, D M']","['Hertan R', 'Farnworth PG', 'Fitzsimmons KL', 'Robertson DM']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Lactoperoxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lactoperoxidase/metabolism', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/*metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sheep']",,1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.140.1.6440 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1999 Jan;140(1):6-12. doi: 10.1210/endo.140.1.6440.,,,,,,['Endocrinology. 1999 Jan;140(1):3-5.

In the present work, we investigated the role of TGF-beta as an endogenous mediator of this process. We found that the TGF-beta1 precursor began to accumulate in cell culture supernatants soon after the addition of 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD) and retinoids. We used neutralizing antibodies (AbTGF-beta) and antisense oligonucleotide (AS Oligo) to inhibit its possible effects. Our data demonstrated that AbTGF-beta partially inhibit the expression of the differentiated phenotype, as assessed by measurement of phagocytic activity, response to the chemotactic peptide fMLP, and lysozyme secretion. AS Oligo was also inhibitory, and the effects of AS Oligo and AbTGF-beta were cumulative. Cell growth inhibition induced by VD and retinoids was completely reversed, and differentiation was reduced by about 75% when both inhibitors were associated. Time course experiments based on the delayed addition of AbTGF-beta and AS Oligo showed that TGF-beta1 was required for cell differentiation 24 h after the addition of inducers. Studies on TGF-beta receptors revealed that, while the expression of type II receptor was stable, the level of type I TGF-beta receptor mRNA and the expression of the protein began to decline early during the differentiation process. As a whole, these results support the notion that an autocrine TGF-beta pathway, activated by VD and retinoids in U937 cells, is involved in the early steps of the process leading to cell growth arrest and differentiation.","['Defacque, H', 'Piquemal, D', 'Basset, A', 'Marti, J', 'Commes, T']","['Defacque H', 'Piquemal D', 'Basset A', 'Marti J', 'Commes T']","['EMBL, Department of Cell Biology, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antisense Elements (Genetics)', 'Autocrine Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/01/14 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/14 03:01'],"['1999/01/14 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/14 03:01 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199901)178:1<109::AID-JCP14>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199901)178:1<109::AID-JCP14>3.0.CO;2-X [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 Jan;178(1):109-19. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199901)178:1<109::AID-JCP14>3.0.CO;2-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Downregulation of c-Myc accompanied by induction of Mad1 upon differentiation has fueled the notion that Mad1 may play a role in the cessation of proliferation associated with the differentiation process. Since studies on Mad1 expression have so far been limited to cells undergoing differentiation, it was of interest to examine Mad1 expression in a cell system unable to differentiate. To do so, we utilized the leukemia-derived B-precursor cell line, Reh, and studied the expressions of Mad1, c-Myc, Mxil, and Max during cAMP-mediated growth inhibition of these cells. Thus, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin induced growth inhibition of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This growth inhibition was associated with transient increased expression of Mad1 concomitant with transient downregulation of c-Myc. The Mad1 protein levels essentially paralleled those of mRNA, with peak levels at 4 h of forskolin treatment. By coimmunoprecipitation we detected increased binding of Mad1 to Max in forskolin-treated cells, indicating that the changes in Mad1 protein levels had functional implications. By continually treating Reh cells with forskolin for 72 h, we observed a sustained elevated expression of Mad1 concomitant with downregulated c-Myc expression, still without changing the differentiation profile of the Reh cells. Interestingly, we showed that other known cell cycle regulatory proteins also were transiently regulated by forskolin. To this extent, following forskolin treatment of Reh cells, cyclin E-cdk2 activity was transiently reduced concomitant with dephosphorylation of pRB. We suggest that the early changes in Mad1 and the cell cycle regulatory proteins initiate a chain of events resulting in permanent growth arrest. Thus, the increased expression of Mad1 in the absence of differentiation indicates that Mad1 expression in Reh cells is linked to growth arrest per se.","['Naderi, S', 'Blomhoff, H K']","['Naderi S', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAD1L1 protein, human)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MXI1 protein, human)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/01/14 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/14 03:01'],"['1999/01/14 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/14 03:01 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199901)178:1<76::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199901)178:1<76::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 Jan;178(1):76-84. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199901)178:1<76::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased GM2 expression by HIV-1 infection of a human T cell line (MOLT4), a human monocyte cell line (U937), and human lymphoblastoid cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining with L55 Ab. These infected cells were readily lysed by L55 Ab in the presence of fresh human serum as a C source that alone did not cause cytolysis. L55 Ab also had the ability to destroy HIV-1 particles via C-mediated lysis. By adding L55 Ab together with human C to mixed culture of HIV-infected cells and naive cells, HIV-1 replication was significantly suppressed, and this effect was synergistic when L55 Ab was combined with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a proteinase inhibitor.

Increased FN and alpha5beta1 integrin gene expression was observed in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA-treated HL-60 cells and PMA- or macrophage-CSF-treated blood monocytes before the manifestation of macrophage markers. After treatment of HL-60 cells and monocytes, newly synthesized FN was released and deposited on the dishes. An HL-60 cell variant, HL-525, which is deficient in the protein kinase Cbeta (PKC-beta) and resistant to PMA-induced differentiation, failed to express FN after PMA treatment. Transfecting HL-525 cells with a PKC-beta expression plasmid restored PMA-induced FN gene expression and macrophage differentiation. Untreated HL-525 cells (which have a high level of the alpha5beta1 integrin) incubated on FN differentiated into macrophages. The percentage of cells having a macrophage phenotype induced by PMA in HL-60 cells, by FN in HL-525 cells, or by either PMA or macrophage-CSF in monocytes was reduced in the presence of mAbs to FN and alpha5beta1 integrin. The integrin-signaling nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, p72Syk, was activated in PMA-treated HL-60 and FN-treated HL-525 cells. We suggest that macrophage differentiation involves the activation of PKC-beta and expression of extracellular matrix proteins such as FN and the corresponding integrins, alpha5beta1 integrin in particular. The stimulated cells, through the integrins, attach to substrates by binding to the deposited FN. This attachment, in turn, may through integrin signaling activate nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including p72Syk, and later lead to expression of other genes involved in evoking the macrophage phenotype.","['Laouar, A', 'Collart, F R', 'Chubb, C B', 'Xie, B', 'Huberman, E']","['Laouar A', 'Collart FR', 'Chubb CB', 'Xie B', 'Huberman E']","['Center for Mechanistic Biology and Biotechnology, Argonne National Laboratory, IL 60439, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jan 1;162(1):407-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied three Fc epsilon RI-dimerizing mAbs that maintain similar dispersed distributions over the surface of RBL-2H3 mast cells but elicit very different signaling responses. Specifically, mAb H10 receptor dimers induce very little inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis, Ca2+ mobilization, secretion, spreading, ruffling, and actin plaque assembly, whereas dimers generated with the other anti-Fc epsilon RI mAbs induce responses that are only modestly lower than that to multivalent Ag. H10 receptor dimers activate Lyn and support Fc epsilon RI beta and gamma subunit phosphorylation but are poor Syk activators compared with Ag and the other anti-Fc epsilon RI mAbs. H10 receptor dimers have two other distinguishing features. First, they induce stable complexes between activated Lyn and receptor subunits. Second, the predominant Lyn-binding phospho-beta isoform found in mAb H10-treated cells is a less tyrosine phosphorylated, more electrophoretically mobile species than the predominant isoform in Ag-treated cells that does not coprecipitate with Lyn. These studies implicate Lyn dissociation from highly phosphorylated receptor subunits as a new regulatory step in the Fc epsilon RI signaling cascade required for Syk activation and signal progression.","['Ortega, E', 'Lara, M', 'Lee, I', 'Santana, C', 'Martinez, A M', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Lee, R J', 'Wilson, B S', 'Oliver, J M']","['Ortega E', 'Lara M', 'Lee I', 'Santana C', 'Martinez AM', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Lee RJ', 'Wilson BS', 'Oliver JM']","['Departamento de Immunologia, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/immunology', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Enzyme Induction/immunology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/biosynthesis/immunology/*metabolism']",,1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jan 1;162(1):176-85.,"['R01GM49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM50562/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03TW00440/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal presentation of TAA might be achieved by retroviral transduction of DCs allowing long term and stable expression of the TAA-peptides as well as the presentation of multiple epitopes in the context of MHC class I and/or class II molecules. Here we show that retroviral transduction of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) with chicken OVA cDNA or the reporter gene green fluorescent protein retained their potent stimulatory capacity and that the transduced DCs could process and present the endogenously expressed OVA protein. The DCs transduced with cDNA encoding native OVA protein presented OVA-derived peptides in the context of MHC class I as well as MHC class II and induced a strong Ag-specific CTL response. DCs expressing a cytosolic form of OVA presented OVA peptides only in the context of MHC class I and failed to induce an OVA-specific CTL response in vivo when they had been cultured in the absence of exogenous protein. Immunization with retrovirally transduced DCs resulted in an Ag-specific immunity and rejection of a tumor cell challenge and a significant survival advantage in tumor-bearing mice. These results obtained in this rapidly lethal tumor model suggest that DCs transduced with TAA may be useful for tumor immunotherapy and underscore the importance of the simultaneous delivery of T cell help in the development of Ag-specific cytotoxic T-cells.,"['De Veerman, M', 'Heirman, C', 'Van Meirvenne, S', 'Devos, S', 'Corthals, J', 'Moser, M', 'Thielemans, K']","['De Veerman M', 'Heirman C', 'Van Meirvenne S', 'Devos S', 'Corthals J', 'Moser M', 'Thielemans K']","['Laboratory of Physiology, Medical School of Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Peptides)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/virology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation/virology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Ovalbumin/immunology/metabolism', 'Peptides/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jan 1;162(1):144-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One ILT, designated ILT1, contains a short cytoplasmic domain that lacks sequence motifs implicated in signal transduction. Its function is unknown. Similar short cytoplasmic domains have been observed in activating NK cell receptors and FcalphaR, which transduce stimulatory signals via associated DAP12 and FcepsilonRIgamma proteins, respectively. Here we show that ILT1 receptor is selectively expressed on myeloid cells, functions as an activating receptor, and associates with FcepsilonRIgamma rather than DAP12.","['Nakajima, H', 'Samaridis, J', 'Angman, L', 'Colonna, M']","['Nakajima H', 'Samaridis J', 'Angman L', 'Colonna M']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (LILRA2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jan 1;162(1):5-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
