Ruxolitinib is the first agent to demonstrate superior efficacy to the best available therapy, but real-life data are still lacking. Here we describe the results of ruxolitinib compassionate use for the treatment of SR/steroid-dependent cGVHD in a tertiary care university hospital. In this retrospective single-center study, we evaluated the outcomes of 48 patients diagnosed with SR-cGVHD who were treated with ruxolitinib. Forty-seven (98%) had moderate-severe disease, and 27 (56%) had received >/=2 lines of prior therapy (excluding steroids). Results were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0.01 and R version 3.4.3. The overall response rate was 77% (37 of 48), with 15% (7 of 37) in complete remission. The median time to response was 2 months (range, 0.5 to 8 months). Steroid tapering was achieved in 26 patients (54%) and definitive discontinuation was achieved in 10 patients (21%) after a median of 20 months (range, 1.5 to 60 months). Toxicity was predominantly hematologic, including a 33% rate of anemia and a 17% rate of thrombocytopenia. Overall survival at 2 years was significantly higher in responders compared with nonresponders (88% [95% confidence interval (CI), 65% to 96%] versus 49% [95% CI, 12% to 78%]; P = .01). At last follow-up, tapering of ruxolitinib had been started in 8 of 37 responders (22%). Our experience supports the efficacy of ruxolitinib in the treatment of SR-cGVHD, along with its steroid-sparing effect and manageable toxicity. Gradual tapering of ruxolitinib seems feasible without cases of GVHD flare. More studies and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these data, as well as to identify the ideal dose adjustments in cases of toxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is an important prognostic factor for ALL treatment response and patient stratification. MRD monitoring uses personalized real-time PCR to measure the amount of cancer cells among normal cells. Due to clonal tumor evolution or secondary rearrangement processes, MRD markers can disappear during treatment, leading to false-negative MRD results and wrong decision-making in personalized treatments. Therefore, monitoring of multiple MRD markers per patient is required. For the first time, the authors present personalized multiplex mediator probe PCR (MP PCR) for MRD monitoring in ALL. These assays can precisely quantify more MRD markers in less sample material. Therefore, clinical outcomes will be less affected by clonal tumor evolution. Personalized duplex MP PCR assays were developed for different genomic MRD markers, including immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, gene fusions, and gene deletions. One duplex assay was successfully applied in a prospective patient case and compared with hydrolysis probes. Moreover, the authors increased the multiplex level from duplex to 4-plex and still met the EuroMRD requirements for reliable quantification. In addition, the authors' MRD-MP design guidelines and multiplex workflow facilitate and accelerate MP PCR assay development. This helps the standardization of personal diagnostics.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients have specific psychosocial and other challenges, influencing their ability to access appropriate treatment. Therefore, in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for AML, inferior outcomes would be observed in AYA patients compared to children. METHODS: We defined the age range of AYA patients as 15 to 29 years. Sixty-three patients who underwent allo-HSCT from 1998 to 2020 at Chang Gung Children Hospital were enrolled in this study. Overall survival was the time duration from HSCT to death from any cause. Disease-free survival was the time duration from HSCT to the last follow-up or first event (failure to achieve complete remission, relapse, secondary malignancy, or death from any cause). RESULTS: Thirty-seven (59%) patients were <15 years of age during allo-HSCT, and 26 (41%) were 15 to 29 years of age. The median age during allo-HSCT was 6.3 years for those <15 years of age compared with 15.7 years for AYA patients. The median follow-up period was 2.2 years after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients <15 years old and 3.8 years after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for AYA patients. Univariate analysis revealed no significant difference in the 5-year overall survival or disease-free survival among all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Several distinct AML subtypes could be amenable to treatment deintensification and targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that children and AYA patients who underwent allo-HSCT for AML had similar survival.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Among 516 AML patients, we compared characteristics and outcomes of 149 patients with ""sAML"" (sAML-AHD: 104, tAML: 45), uniformly and intensively treated during the last 2 decades at 1 center. Clinical outcomes of the whole ""sAML"" cohort were significantly inferior compared to de novo AML and in both intermediate and poor cytogenetic risk groups. Adverse karyotype had no effect on survival in tAML, while it was a negative predictor in sAML-AHD. Both groups showed similarly dismal outcome, with low complete remission rates (CR 44% vs. 41%) and median overall survival (OS 7 vs. 10.5 months). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) recipients in CR1 had superior median OS (24 vs. 8 months).

According to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, MPNs include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The 2016 revision aimed in particular at strengthening the distinction between masked PV and JAK2-mutated ET, and between prefibrotic/early (pre-PMF) and overt PMF. Clinical manifestations in MPNs include constitutional symptoms, microvascular disorders, thrombosis and bleeding, splenomegaly secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis, cytopenia-related symptoms, and progression to overt MF and acute leukemia. A dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway is the unifying mechanistic hallmark of MPNs, and is guided by somatic mutations in driver genes including JAK2, CALR and MPL. Additional mutations in myeloid neoplasm-associated genes have been also identified, with established prognostic relevance, particularly in PMF. Prognostication of MPN patients relies on disease-specific clinical models. The increasing knowledge of MPN biology led to the development of integrated clinical and molecular prognostic scores that allow a more refined stratification. Recently, the therapeutic landscape of MPNs has been revolutionized by the introduction of potent, selective JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, fedratinib), that proved effective in controlling disease-related symptoms and splenomegaly, yet leaving unmet critical needs, owing the lack of disease-modifying activity. In this review, we will deal with molecular, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of the three classical MPNs aiming at highlighting either shared characteristics, that overall define a continuum within a single disease family, and uniqueness, at the same time.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: A total of 453 lymphoma cases, identified retrospectively from January 2000 to October 2011, were studied to identify the subtype distribution of lymphoma in our center, located in southern Iran, according to the latest WHO classification. Results: The most common sites of involvement of all lymphomas were extranodal (59.16%). The highest frequency of extranodal sites in all lymphoid neoplasms were associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (22.95%) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (10.15%). Of 453 cases, 23 (5.32%) were T and natural killer cell neoplasms, of which the most common subtypes were T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Conclusion: This study indicated that the subtype distribution of lymphoma (except for the higher prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and lower rate of follicular lymphoma) in this part of Iran is similar to that in the Middle Eastern countries.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize MCC-specific mortality compared to other causes of death for patients with hematologic malignancy in MCC, which will guide workup and surveillance strategies. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-18 registry was queried for MCC patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). RESULTS: Of 8519 patients with MCC, 146 (1.7%) had CLL and 234 (2.8%) had NHL. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had 5-year cumulative incidence of MCC-specific mortality of 38.4% versus 28.4% in patients without CLL/NHL. For both cohorts, oncologic risk was highest within the first three years of diagnosis with competing risks favored thereafter. On competing risk regression, a history of CLL trended toward statistical significance with poorer MCC-specific mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.963-1.834, P=0.084), while NHL was not prognostic. CONCLUSIONS: Merkel cell carcinoma patients with CLL may benefit from more aggressive initial management.

However, adverse reactions and transplantation-related death may still occur in patients receiving CBT even when donor and recipient have fully matched HLA in high-resolution HLA typing analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HLA-related and unrelated genes are known to associate with disease status of patients with unrelated stem cell transplantation. In this study, the genomic regions ranging from 500 base pairs upstream to 500 base pairs downstream of the eight SNPs that were reported as transplantation determinants by Petersdorf et al. were analyzed to evaluate whether genetic variants were associated with the survival status of patients, and the risk for severe (grades 3-4) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation. The analyses were performed in the mode of recipient genotype, donor genotype, and recipient-donor mismatching, respectively. By analysis of sixty-five patients and their HLA-matched unrelated donors, we found that five SNPs were associated with patient survival which included the recipient genotype with SNPs of rs107822 in the RING1 gene, and rs2070120, rs17220087 and rs17213693 in the HLA-DOB gene; and the recipient-donor mismatching with SNPs of rs9282369 in HLA-DOA gene, and rs2070120, rs17220087 and rs17213693 in the HLA-DOB gene.

We report the identification of both structural drivers, as well as recurrent non-coding variation in promoters. Additionally we found the transcriptional profile of histone gene cluster 1 and CTCF altered tumours shared hallmarks of hyperdiploid ALL suggesting a 'hyperdiploid like' subtype. ALL subtypes are driven by distinct mutational processes with AID mutagenesis being confined to ETV6-RUNX1 tumours. Subclonality is a ubiquitous feature of ALL, consistent with Darwinian evolution driving selection and expansion of tumours.

Here, we identify the small molecule CX-5461 as selectively cytotoxic to high-risk neuroblastoma and synergistic with low picomolar concentrations of topoisomerase I inhibitors in improving survival in vivo in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft neuroblastoma mouse models. CX-5461 recently progressed through phase I clinical trial as a first-in-human inhibitor of RNA-POL I. However, we also use a comprehensive panel of in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that CX-5461 has been mischaracterized and that its primary target at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, is in fact topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B), not RNA-POL I. This is important because existing clinically approved chemotherapeutics have well-documented off-target interactions with TOP2B, which have previously been shown to cause both therapy-induced leukemia and cardiotoxicity-often-fatal adverse events, which can emerge several years after treatment. Thus, while we show that combination therapies involving CX-5461 have promising anti-tumor activity in vivo in neuroblastoma, our identification of TOP2B as the primary target of CX-5461 indicates unexpected safety concerns that should be examined in ongoing phase II clinical trials in adult patients before pursuing clinical studies in children.",['(c) 2021.

DATA SOURCES: In a prospective, single-blinded quasi-experimental study, 30 survivors of childhood ALL (63.3% boys; age: 13.1 +/- 2.8 years) were allocated to undergo the Aqua-PLYO exercise program (Aqua-PLYO group; n=15) or the usual physical therapy (Control group; n=15). Bone mineralization (bone mineral density [BMD], bone mineral content [BMC], BMD Z-score, and BMD volumetric [BMDvol]), functional capacity, and quality of life were assessed prior to, and following 36 treatment sessions, which were undertaken over nonconsecutive days in a 12-week program. With controlling for the pretreatment values, all measures of bone mineralization, functional capacity, and quality of life showed more favorable posttreatment improvement in the Aqua-PLYO group as compared to the control group (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: The Aqua-PLYO exercises, besides the usual physical therapy, can effectively improve bone health, increase functional capacity, and promote a better quality of life in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Although survivors of childhood ALL experience reduced BMD, functional ability, and quality of life, Aqua-PLYO exercises can have positive effects on survivors' physical and functional disturbances and can, even more, be enjoyable and increase their motivation and interest in engaging in exercise interventions.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A total of 93 children with AML were prospectively enrolled in this study. Chemotherapy with the 2015-AML-03 regimen was completed according to the risk stratification determined by genetic abnormality at initial diagnosis and MRD and bone marrow cytology after induction therapy I. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to dynamically monitor MRD and analyze the prognostic effect of MRD on 3-year cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) rate, event-free survival (EFS) rate, and overall survival (OS) rate. RESULTS: The 93 children with AML had a 3-year CIR rate of 48%+/-6%, a median time to recurrence of 11 months (range 2-32 months), a 3-year OS rate of 65%+/-6%, and a 3-year EFS rate of 50%+/-5%. After induction therapy I and intensive therapy I, the MRD-positive children had a significantly higher 3-year CIR rate and significantly lower 3-year EFS and OS rates than the MRD-negative children (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in 3-year CIR, EFS, and OS rates between the MRD-positive children with a low risk at initial diagnosis and the MRD-negative children after adjustment of chemotherapy intensity (P>0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that positive MRD after intensive treatment I was a risk factor for 3-year OS rate in children with AML (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MRD has predictive value for the prognosis of children with AML. Based on the MRD-guided risk stratification therapy, reasonable application of chemotherapy may improve the overall prognosis of children with AML.",,"['Huo, Ya', 'Guan, Xian-Min', 'Dou, Ying', 'Wen, Xian-Hao', 'Guo, Yu-Xia', 'Shen, Ya-Li', 'An, Xi-Zhou', 'Yu, Jie']","['Huo Y', 'Guan XM', 'Dou Y', 'Wen XH', 'Guo YX', 'Shen YL', 'An XZ', 'Yu J']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com)."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/National Children's Health and Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center/National International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Critical Child Developmental Diseases/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China (Yu J, Email: 1808106657@qq. com).""]","['eng', 'chi']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['2015-AML-03 regimen', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Child', 'Measurable residual disease', 'Multiparameter flow cytometry']",2021/11/11 06:00,2021/11/12 06:00,['2021/11/10 05:37'],"['2021/11/10 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1008-8830(2021)11-1111-08 [pii]', '10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2106102 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2021 Nov 15;23(11):1111-1118. doi: 10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2106102.,23,11,1111-1118,20211111,"['Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis']",PMC8580021,,,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its therapy has not significantly improved during the past four decades despite intense research efforts. New molecularly targeted therapies are in great need. The proto-oncogene c-Myc (MYC) is an attractive target due to its transactivation role in multiple signaling cascades. Deregulation of the MYC is considered one of a series of oncogenic events required for tumorigenesis. However, limited knowledge is available on which mechanism underlie MYC dysregulation and how long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in MYC dysregulation in AML. METHODS: AML microarray chips and public datasets were screened to identify novel lncRNA GAS6-AS1 was dysregulated in AML. Gain or loss of functional leukemia cell models were produced, and in vitro and in vivo experiments were applied to demonstrate its leukemogenic phenotypes. Interactive network analyses were performed to define intrinsic mechanism. RESULTS: We identified GAS6-AS1 was overexpressed in AML, and its aberrant function lead to more aggressive leukemia phenotypes and poorer survival outcomes. We revealed that GAS6-AS1 directly binds Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to facilitate its interaction with MYC, leading to MYC transactivation and upregulation of IL1R1, RAB27B and other MYC target genes associated with leukemia progression. Further, lentiviral-based GAS6-AS1 silencing inhibited leukemia progression in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed a previously unappreciated role of GAS6-AS1 as an oncogenic lncRNA in AML progression and prognostic prediction. Importantly, we demonstrated that therapeutic targeting of the GAS6-AS1/YBX1/MYC axis inhibits AML cellular propagation and disease progression. Our insight in lncRNA associated MYC-driven leukemogenesis may contribute to develop new anti-leukemia treatment strategies.",['(c) 2021.

Iron overload (IOL) caused by transfusion occurred in most MDS patients. But how IOL influences MDS progression has not been clarified yet. METHODS: Herein, we collected clinical data from 143 MDS patients to investigate the impacts of IOL on patients survival and AML transformation. RESULTS: We found that median survival time, 3-year survival rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) time were significantly shorter in patients with IOL than those with non-iron overload (NIOL) (P = 0.040; P = 0.044; P = 0.037). Besides, IOL was more likely to be found in higher-risk subgroups (assessed by IPSS and WPSS) of MDS patients which also promoted 2-year AML transformation. Furthermore, the serum ferritin (SF) was significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of MDS patients (r = -0.311, P < 0.05). The concentrations of both intracellular iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CD34(+) cells of bone marrow were higher in the IOL group than the NIOL group, respectively (P = 0.0426; P = 0.0185). Moreover, ROS level was closely correlated with the percentage of bone marrow blasts (r = 0.7200, P = 0.0370). Collectively, IOL threatened the survival of MDS patients and promoted AML transformation. CONCLUSION: Elevated intracellular iron and ROS in CD34(+) cells of bone marrow could accelerate the abnormal proliferation of blasts.",,"['Wang, Yihao', 'Huang, Lei', 'Hua, Yanni', 'Liu, Hui', 'Jiang, Huijuan', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Fu, Rong', 'Shao, Zonghong']","['Wang Y', 'Huang L', 'Hua Y', 'Liu H', 'Jiang H', 'Wang H', 'Zhang W', 'Fu R', 'Shao Z']","[""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Iron overload', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'red blood cell transfusion', 'survival']",2021/11/11 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/11/10 05:29'],"['2021/11/10 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1989806 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):874-880. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1989806.,26,1,874-880,20211117,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Transfusion', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/complications/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Young Adult']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5995-8542'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circular RNA hsa_circ_0000745 (circ_0000745) has been reported as an oncogene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, whether circ_0000745 can drive T-ALL progression by controlling notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1) expression is unclear. METHODS: Relative expression of circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 in bone marrow (BM) samples and T-ALL cells was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Loss- and gain-of-function experiments were executed to evaluate the effects of circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 on T-ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis. The microRNAs (miRs) that might jointly interact with circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and verified by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. RESULTS: Circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 were overexpressed in T-ALL BM and T-ALL cells. Functionally, both circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 overexpression promoted T-ALL cell proliferation and curbed T-ALL cell apoptosis. In contrast, both circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 silencing restrained T-ALL cell proliferation and induced T-ALL cell apoptosis. Furthermore, circ_0000745 could control T-ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis through regulating NOTCH1 expression. Importantly, circ_0000745 regulated NOTCH1 expression by sponging miR-193b-3p. CONCLUSION: Our findings proposed a novel model in which circ_0000745 promoted cell proliferation and curbed cell apoptosis via upregulating NOTCH1 through serving as a miR-193b-3p sponge in T-ALL.",,"['Feng, Huanhuan', 'Li, Fei', 'Tang, Ping']","['Feng H', 'Li F', 'Tang P']","[""Department of Neonatology, Xi'an Gaoxi Hospital, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neonatology, Xi'an Gaoxi Hospital, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neonatology, Xi'an Gaoxi Hospital, Xi'an, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['NOTCH1', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'circ_0000745', 'miR-193b-3p']",2021/11/11 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/11/10 05:29'],"['2021/11/10 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1997197 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):885-895. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1997197.,26,1,885-895,20211117,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Circular/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4336-4202'],"['0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRESENTATION OF CASE: 62-year-old Romanian male presented at the outpatient general surgery clinic in April 2019 complaining of bilateral inguinal swelling that gradually increased in size mainly on right side and was diagnosed with bilateral inguinal hernia. During the laparoscopic repair of the hernia, a large lymph node in the left femoral canal was incidentally observed. Histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and flowcytometric evaluation of the excised specimen confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. DISCUSSION: Whole body CT showed supra and infra-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathy, and few small subsolid pulmonary nodules, possibly metastatic. Splenomegaly and pancreatomegaly were also noted, suggesting lymphomatoid infiltration. CONCLUSION: There is need for cautious inspection and meticulous palpation of the inguinal area for any lymphadenopathy during routine inguinal hernia repair.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Hypomethylating drugs are currently approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and some studies have recently been carried out on diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is a type of NonHodgkin lymphoma. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 in mediating the epigenetic regulation of some key targets previously emerged as hypermethylated in NonHodgkin lymphoma. Reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR, genomewide arrays and methylationspecific PCR were used to determine the level of methylation of specific targets. Gene silencing, gene expression and immunoblotting were used to investigate the role of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in lymphoma cells. The present study showed that lymphoma cell lines displayed a completely different methylation profile on selected targets compared with primary B lymphocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 5'azacytidine (5AZA) and 5'aza2deoxycitidine (decitabine) exerted their activity through, at least in part, mechanisms independent of DNMT1 downregulation. Despite a global hypomethylating effect of 5AZA and decitabine, DNMT1 was not found to be necessary to maintain the hypermethylation of Kruppellike factor 4 (KLF4), death associated protein 1 (DAPK1) and spastic paraplegia 20 (SPG20). SPG20 was found to be a completely methylated target in all the tested cell lines, but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting its association with malignancy. The highest methylation was clustered upstream of the transcription starting site in a panel of 28 DLBCL cell lines and the results were unaffected by the silencing of DNMT1 expression. These data demonstrated the epigenetic regulation of SPG20 in lymphoid cells and identified a number of novel markers associated with lymphomas that deserve further investigation.",,"['Frazzi, Raffaele', 'Cusenza, Vincenza Ylenia', 'Pistoni, Mariaelena', 'Canovi, Laura', 'Cascione, Luciano', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Merli, Francesco']","['Frazzi R', 'Cusenza VY', 'Pistoni M', 'Canovi L', 'Cascione L', 'Bertoni F', 'Merli F']","['Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, I42123 Reggio Emilia, EmiliaRomagna, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, I42123 Reggio Emilia, EmiliaRomagna, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, I42123 Reggio Emilia, EmiliaRomagna, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusional Medicine Division, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, I42123 Reggio Emilia, EmiliaRomagna, Italy.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, University of Italian Switzerland, 6501 Bellinzona, Ticino, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, University of Italian Switzerland, 6501 Bellinzona, Ticino, Switzerland.', 'Hematology Division, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, I42123 Reggio Emilia, EmiliaRomagna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211109,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methyltransferase 1', 'diffuse large B cell lymphoma', 'opensea regions', 'promoter methylation', 'spastic paraplegia 20']",2021/11/10 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/11/09 09:21'],"['2021/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/09 09:21 [entrez]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/or.2021.8221 [doi]', '10 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2022 Jan;47(1). pii: 10. doi: 10.3892/or.2021.8221.

The molecular genetic and clinical characterizations of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isolated trisomy 4, 11, or 21 have been poorly investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 41 chromosomal gene translocations/fusion genes, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed on 29 AML patients with trisomy 4, 11, or 21 as the sole chromosomal anomaly. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, one or more mutations were detected in 93.1% of patients. CEBPA had the highest mutation frequency, followed by TET2, NPM1, DNMT3A, and FLT3-ITD. The sole +11 AML patients exhibited more mutations in FLT3-ITD (P = .031) than the sole +21 AML patients, while CEBPA mutation was more frequently found in the sole +21 AML patients than that in the sole +11 AML patients(P = .07). The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with +11 were shorter than those with +4(P = .015, 0.046) or +21 (0.057, 0.064), but no difference was found between +4 patients and +21 patients. In the whole cohort, only the FLT3-ITD mutation was significantly associated with inferior OS (18 vs. 35 months, P = .023) and DFS (12 months vs. NR, P = .046). There were no significant differences in OS and DFS according to the gene mutation status of CEBPA, TET2, NPM1, DNMT3A, and IDH1/2. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly different mutation profile among the sole +4, +11, +21 AML patients.

The possible regulatory role of PAKs in cell metabolism has not been well explored, but increasing evidence suggests that a cell metabolic phenotype is related to cell interactions with the microenvironment. We analyzed the impact of PAK inhibition by small molecule inhibitors, small interfering RNA, or gene knockout on the rates of mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK group I by IPA-3 induced a strong decrease in metabolic rates in human adherent cancer cell lines, leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, and primary leukemia cells. The immediate effect of FRAX597, which inhibits PAK kinase activity, was moderate, indicating that PAK nonkinase functions are essential for cell metabolism. Selective downregulation or deletion of PAK2 was associated with a shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, PAK1 knockout resulted in increased glycolysis. However, the overall metabolic capacity was not substantially reduced by PAK1 or PAK2 deletion, possibly due to partial redundancy in PAK1/PAK2 regulatory roles or to activation of other compensatory mechanisms.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Koranova, Tereza', 'Dvoracek, Lukas', 'Grebenova, Dana', 'Roselova, Pavla', 'Obr, Adam', 'Kuzelova, Katerina']","['Koranova T', 'Dvoracek L', 'Grebenova D', 'Roselova P', 'Obr A', 'Kuzelova K']","['Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211108,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['cell metabolism', 'glycolysis', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'p21-activated kinase 1', 'p21-activated kinase 2']",2021/11/10 06:00,2021/11/10 06:00,['2021/11/09 07:12'],"['2021/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/09 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.30175 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2021 Nov 8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.30175.,,,,,,,"['research organization No 00023736/Ministry of Health, Czech Republic', 'AIIHHP/European Regional Development Fund and the Ministry of Education, Youth', 'and Sport, Czech Republic (OP ERD)', 'CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_025/0007428/European Regional Development Fund and the', 'Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Czech Republic (OP ERD)']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9628-6255'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median interval from alloSCT to DLI1 was 176 days, median follow-up was 7.0 years. Five-year cumulative relapse incidence (CRI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free and overall survival (LFS/OS) of the entire cohort were 29.1%, 12.7%, 58.2%, and 64.3%.

GvHD did not influence CRI, but was associated with NRM and lower LFS/OS. Efficacy of preDLI was demonstrated by decreasing MRD/increasing blood counts in 71%, and increasing chimerism in 70%. Five-year OS after preDLI for MRD/MC was 51%/68% among responders, and 37% among non-responders.

Efforts to better understand FLT3-ITD downstream signaling to possibly improve therapy response are needed. We have previously described FLT3-ITD-dependent phosphorylation of CSF2RB, the common receptor beta chain of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, and therefore examined its significance for FLT3-ITD-dependent oncogenic signaling and transformation. We discovered that FLT3-ITD directly binds to CSF2RB in AML cell lines and blasts isolated from AML patients. A knockdown of CSF2RB in FLT3-ITD positive AML cell lines as well as in a xenograft model decreased STAT5 phosphorylation, attenuated cell proliferation, and sensitized to FLT3 inhibition. Bone marrow from CSF2RB-deficient mice transfected with FLT3-ITD displayed decreased colony formation capacity and delayed disease onset together with increased survival upon transplantation into lethally irradiated mice. FLT3-ITD-dependent CSF2RB phosphorylation required phosphorylation of the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain at tyrosines 589 or 591, whereas the ITD insertion site and sequence were of no relevance. Our results demonstrate that CSF2RB participates in FLT3-ITD-dependent oncogenic signaling and transformation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, CSF2RB constitutes a rational treatment target in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",['(c) 2021.

34750375,NLM,In-Process,20220111,2041-4889 (Electronic),2021 Nov 8,TCP1 increases drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia by suppressing autophagy via activating AKT/mTOR signaling.,10.1038/s41419-021-04336-w [doi],"T-complex protein 1 (TCP1) is one of the subunits of chaperonin-containing T complex (CCT), which is involved in protein folding, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and drug resistance. Investigations have demonstrated that TCP1 is a factor being responsible for drug resistance in breast and ovarian cancer. However, the TCP1 role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains elusive. In the present study, we discovered that the TCP1 expression was elevated in AML patients and high TCP1 expression was associated with low complete response rate along with poor overall survival. TCP1 showed higher expression in the adriamycin-resistant leukemia cell line HL60/A and K562/A, comparing to their respective parent cells HL60 and K562 cells. TCP1 inhibition suppressed drug resistance in HL60/A and K562/A cells, whereas TCP1 overexpression in HL60 cells incremented drug resistance, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that TCP1 inhibited autophagy and adriamycin-induced cell apoptosis, and TCP1-mediated autophagy inhibition conferred resistance to adriamycin-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, TCP1 interacted with AKT and mTOR to activate AKT/mTOR signaling, which negatively regulates apoptosis and autophagy.

This CAR demonstrates anti-AML activity without affecting the healthy hematopoietic system, or causing epithelial tissue damage in a xenograft model. CD123 expression on leukemia cells increases upon 5'-Azacitidine (AZA) treatment. AZA treatment of leukemia-bearing mice causes an increase in CTLA-4(negative) anti-CD123 CAR T cell numbers following infusion. Functionally, the CTLA-4(negative) anti-CD123 CAR T cells exhibit superior cytotoxicity against AML cells, accompanied by higher TNFalpha production and enhanced downstream phosphorylation of key T cell activation molecules.

Ibrutinib is a first-in class, oral, covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (BTKi) that has shown impressive clinical activity, yet many ibrutinib-treated patients relapse or develop resistance over time. We have reported that acquired resistance to ibrutinib is associated with downregulation of tumor suppressor protein PTEN and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Yet how PTEN mediates chemoresistance in B-cell malignancies is not clear. We now show that the BTKi ibrutinib and a second-generation compound, acalabrutinib downregulate miRNAs located in the 14q32 miRNA cluster region, including miR-494, miR-495, and miR-543. BTKi-resistant CLL and DLBCL cells had striking overexpression of miR-494, miR-495, miR-543, and reduced PTEN expression, indicating further regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in acquired BTKi resistance. Additionally, unlike ibrutinib-sensitive CLL patient samples, those with resistance to ibrutinib treatment, demonstrated upregulation of 14q32 cluster miRNAs, including miR-494, miR-495, and miR-543 and decreased pten mRNA expression. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-494 directly targeted and suppressed PTEN expression by recognizing two conserved binding sites in the PTEN 3'-UTR, and subsequently activated AKT(Ser473). Importantly, overexpression of a miR-494 mimic abrogated both PTEN mRNA and protein levels, further indicating regulation of apoptosis by PTEN/AKT/mTOR. Conversely, overexpression of a miR-494 inhibitor in BTKi-resistant cells restored PTEN mRNA and protein levels, thereby sensitizing cells to BTKi-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-494 and miR-495 sensitized cells by cooperative targeting of pten, with additional miRNAs in the 14q32 cluster that target pten able to contribute to its regulation. Therefore, targeting 14q32 cluster miRNAs may have therapeutic value in acquired BTK-resistant patients via regulation of the PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling axis.",['(c) 2021.

For example, the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib decreases mortality for chronic myeloid leukemia by 80%, but 22 to 41% of patients acquire resistance to imatinib. About 70% of relapsed patients harbor mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain, where more than a hundred different mutations have been identified. Some mutations are located near the imatinib-binding site and cause resistance through altered interactions with the drug. However, many resistance mutations are located far from the drug-binding site, and it remains unclear how these mutations confer resistance. Additionally, earlier studies on small sets of patient-derived imatinib resistance mutations indicated that some of these mutant proteins were in fact sensitive to imatinib in cellular and biochemical studies. Here, we surveyed the resistance of 94 patient-derived Abl kinase domain mutations annotated as disease relevant or resistance causing using an engagement assay in live cells. We found that only two-thirds of mutations weaken imatinib affinity by more than twofold compared to Abl wild type. Surprisingly, one-third of mutations in the Abl kinase domain still remain sensitive to imatinib and bind with similar or higher affinity than wild type. Intriguingly, we identified three clinical Abl mutations that bind imatinib with wild type-like affinity but dissociate from imatinib considerably faster.

Radium-223 dichloride ((223)RaCl2) is FDA approved for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and Actinium-225 ((225)Ac-Lintuzumab) radiolabeled antibodies have been shown to be beneficial for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In recent years, there is an increasing use of alpha emitters in theranostic agents with both small and large molecule constructs. The proper precautionary means for their use and surveying documentation of these isotopes in a clinical setting are an essential accompaniment to these treatments. Methods: Patient treatment data collected over a three-year period, as well as regulatory requirements and safety practices, are described. Commonly used radiation instrumentation was evaluated for their ability to identify potential radioactive material spills and contamination events during a clinical administration of (225)Ac. These instruments were placed at 0.32 cm from a 1.0 cm (225)Ac disk source for measurement purposes. Radiation background values, efficiencies, and minimal detectable activities were measured and calculated for each type of detector. Results: The median external measured patient dose rate from (223)RaCl2 patients (n = 611) was 2.5 microSv hr-1 on contact and 0.2 microSv hr-1 at 1 meter immediately after administration. Similarly, (225)Ac-Lintuzumab (n = 19) patients had median external dose rates of 2.0 microSv hr-1 on contact and 0.3 microSv hr-1 at 1 meter. For the measurement of (225)Ac samples, a liquid scintillation counter was found to have the highest overall efficiency (97%), while a zinc sulfide (ZnS) alpha probe offered the lowest minimal detectable activity at 3 counts per minute. Conclusion: In this study, we report data from 630 patients who were undergoing treatment with alpha-emitting isotopes (223)Ra and (225)Ac. While alpha emitters have ability to deliver higher internal radiation dose to the tissues exposed as compared with other unsealed radionuclides, they typically present minimal external dose rate concerns. Additionally, alpha radiation can be efficiently detected with appropriate radiation instrumentation, such as a liquid scintillation counter or ZnS probe, that should be prioritized when surveying for spills of alpha-emitters.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.']","['Serencsits, Brian', 'Chu, Bae', 'Pandit-Taskar, Neeta', 'McDevitt, Michael R', 'Dauer, Lawrence Thomas']","['Serencsits B', 'Chu B', 'Pandit-Taskar N', 'McDevitt MR', 'Dauer LT']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211108,United States,J Nucl Med Technol,Journal of nuclear medicine technology,0430303,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Instrumentation', 'Radiation Safety', 'Radionuclide Therapy', 'actinium', 'alpha-emitters', 'nuclear medicine', 'radiation efficiency', 'radium']",2021/11/10 06:00,2021/11/10 06:00,['2021/11/09 06:14'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/09 06:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jnmt.121.262294 [pii]', '10.2967/jnmt.121.262294 [doi]']",aheadofprint,J Nucl Med Technol. 2021 Nov 8. pii: jnmt.121.262294. doi: 10.2967/jnmt.121.262294.,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8276-0940', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1551-2036', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5629-8462']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this model is underutilised in patients with haematological malignancies. We investigated the presence and described the frequency of quality indicators for palliative care and end-of-life care in a cohort of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia receiving early palliative supportive care. METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective study based on 215 patients consecutively enrolled at a haematology early palliative supportive care clinic in Modena, Italy. Comprehensive hospital chart reviews were performed to abstract the presence of well-established quality indicators for palliative care and for aggressiveness of care near the end of life. RESULTS: 131 patients received a full early palliative supportive care intervention. All patients had at least one and 67 (51%) patients had four or more quality indicators for palliative care. Only 2.7% of them received chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life. None underwent intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was admitted to intensive care unit during the last month of life. Only 4% had either multiple hospitalisations or two or more emergency department access. Approximately half of them died at home or in a hospice. More than 40% did not receive transfusions within 7 days of death. The remaining 84 patients, considered late referrals to palliative care, demonstrated sensibly lower frequencies of the same indicators.

Few studies have examined the impact of IDH mutations in AML on allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center study, alloBMT outcomes for 61 patients with IDH-mutated (mIDH) AML were compared to those for 146 patients with IDH-wildtype (wtIDH) AML. RESULTS: Patients with mIDH AML had a 2-year overall survival (OS) of 85% (95% CI 76%-95%), 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) of 71% (95% CI 59%-85%), 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of 14% (95% CI 5%-23%) and a 1-year cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (CITRM) of 3% (95% CI 0%-8%). Patients with wtIDH had a 2-year OS of 61% (95% CI 53%-70%), 2-year RFS of 58% (95% CI 50%-67%), 1-year CIR of 27% (95% CI 20%-35%), and a 1-year CITRM of 9% (95% CI 5%-14%). In a univariate analysis cox-proportional hazard model, mIDH was associated with significantly better OS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.96) and a trend toward better RFS (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.01). After controlling for donor age, diagnosis, and ELN risk category, mIDH was associated with a nonsignificantly improved OS (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-1.01) and RFS (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39-1.15). CONCLUSION: Among patients with mIDH AML, patients who received a peritransplant IDH inhibitor had improved OS (P = .03) compared to those who did not, but there was no detectable difference for RFS (P = .29).",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, approximately 50% of patients with CBF-AML remain incurable and their outcomes are also determined by the various co-occurring mutations. Though, FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3(FLT3) mutation in AML is associated with poor survival, the prevalence and prognostic significance of FLT3 mutations among CBF-AML is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of FLT3 mutations (ITD and TKD) among patients with CBF-AML. The pooled prevalence of FLT3 mutations was estimated for patients with CBF-AML, t(8;21) and Inv(16). Pooled odds ratio was calculated to compare the prevalence of various FLT3 mutations within the 2 subsets of CBF-AML. A random effects model was adopted for analysis when heterogenicity existed (Pheterogenicity< 0.05 or I(2) > 50%). Otherwise, a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of any FLT3 mutations among patients with CBF-AML was available from 18 studies and was 13% (95% CI: 10%-16%; I(2) = 79%). Comparison of prevalence of FLT3 mutations between the 2 subgroups of CBF-AML showed that patients with t(8;21) had a higher prevalence of FLT3-ITD [pooled odds ratio(OR): 2.23 (95% CI:1.41-3.53, P < .01)] and lower prevalence of FLT3-TKD [pooled OR: 0.29 (95% CI:0.19-0.44; P < .01)] compared to patients with Inv(16). Additionally, we have discussed the prognostic significance of FLT3 mutations in CBF-AML patients. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of FLT3-TKD mutation was commoner among Inv(16) AML while FLT3-ITD mutation was commoner among t(8;21) AML. Uniform reporting of outcomes is essential to understand the prognostic significance of FLT3 mutations among CBF-AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Using a zebrafish xenograft model, we observed that the hypoxic hematopoietic tissue preserved most of the chemoresistant leukemic cells following the doxorubicin (Dox) treatment. And hypoxia upregulated TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, and increased lysosomes in leukemic cells. Specimens from relapsed myeloid leukemia patients also harbored excessive lysosomes, which trapped Dox and prevented drug nuclear influx leading to leukemia chemoresistance. Pharmaceutical inhibition of lysosomes enhanced Dox-induced cytotoxicity against leukemic cells under hypoxia circumstance. To overcome lysosome associated chemoresistance, we developed a pH-sensitive dextran-doxorubicin nanomedicine (Dex-Dox) that efficiently released Dox from lysosomes and increased drug nuclear influx. More importantly, Dex-Dox treatment significantly improved the chemotherapy outcome in the zebrafish xenografts transplanted with cultured leukemic cells or relapsed patient specimens. Overall, we developed a novel lysosome targeting nanomedicine that is promising to overcome the myeloid leukemia chemoresistance.",['(c) 2021.

And the disturbance of gut microbiota is generally believed to impair intestinal barrier function and may induce bacterial infections and inflammation. The study aimed to investigate the alterations in the gut microbiota and assess its relationship with chemotherapy-induced pneumonia in pediatric ALL patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with 14 cases affected by pneumonia and 44 unaffected subjects and characterized the physiological parameters and gut microbiota by microarray-based technique. RESULTS: There were significant differences in alpha- and beta-diversity in the affected group compared with the control group. At species level, the LEfSe analysis revealed that Enterococcus malodoratus, Ochrobactrum anthropi and Actinomyces cardiffensis were significantly abundant in the affected subjects. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve yielded the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.773 for classification between the two groups. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways involved in the bacterial secretion system were more enriched in the affected group than in the control group.

However, manually locating, identifying, and counting the different classes of WBC is time-consuming and fatiguing. Classification and counting accuracy depends on the capability and experience of operators. RESULTS: This paper uses a deep learning method to count cells in color bone marrow microscopic images automatically. The proposed method uses a Faster RCNN and a Feature Pyramid Network to construct a system that deals with various illumination levels and accounts for color components' stability. The dataset of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University is used to train and test. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments test the effectiveness of the proposed white blood cell classification system using a total of 609 white blood cell images with a resolution of 2560 x 1920. The highest overall correct recognition rate could reach 98.8% accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed system is comparable to some state-of-art systems. A user interface allows pathologists to operate the system easily.",['(c) 2021.

SUMMARY: The bone marrow-based disease is preceded by the 2 sequential premalignant conditions: monoclonal gammo-pathy of undetermined significance and smoldering myeloma. Plasma cell leukemia and extramedullary disease occur, when malignant clones lose their dependency on the bone marrow. Key genetic features of these plasma cell dyscrasias include chromosomal aberrations such as translocations and hyperdiploidy, which occur during error-prone physiologic processes in B-cell development. Next-generation sequencing studies have identified mutations in major oncogenic pathways and tumor suppressors, which contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma and have revealed insights into the clonal evolution of the disease, particularly along different lines of therapy. More recently, the importance of epigenetic alterations and the role of the bone marrow microenvironment, including immune and osteogenic cells, have become evident. Key Messages: We herein review the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma, which is crucial for the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies. These can contribute to the endeavor to make multiple myeloma a curable disease.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by S.

However, the oncogenic roles of MYC in MDS remain to be explored. A total of 41 patients with de novo MDS were retrospectively identified using the Total Cancer Care database at the Moffitt Cancer Center. A total of 61 % of patients had low MYC expression and 39 % of patients had high MYC expression defined as MYC reactivity by immunohistochemical staining in >/=5% of bone marrow (BM) cells at the time of MDS diagnosis. The median MDS-to-AML progression free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in the high MYC group (median PFS 9.3 vs. 17.7 months, HR = 2.328, p = 0.013). Further, overall survival (OS) was also shorter in the high MYC patients (median OS 19.7 vs. 51.7 months, HR = 2.299, p = 0.053). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that high MYC expression is an independent poor prognostic factor for the MDS-to-AML progression (HR = 2.275, p = 0.046).

They can be stockpiled, rapidly reconstituted, and infused regardless of the recipient's blood type. Thrombosomes thus represent a potential alternative platelet transfusion strategy. The present study assessed the safety and potential early signals of efficacy of Thrombosomes in bleeding thrombocytopenic patients. We performed an open-label, phase 1 study of single doses of allogeneic Thrombosomes at three dose levels in three cohorts, each consisting of eight patients who had hematologic malignancies, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding. Adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scores, and hematology values were assessed. No DLTs were reported. The median age was 59 years (24-71). Most patients had AML (58%) or ALL (29%), followed by MDS (8%) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (4%). The WHO scores of 22 patients who were actively bleeding at a total of 27 sites at baseline either improved (n = 17 [63%]) or stabilized (n = 10 [37%]) through day 6. Twenty-four hours after infusion, 12 patients (50%) had a clinically significant platelet count increase. Of eight patients who received no platelet transfusions for 6 days after Thrombosomes infusion, 5 had a clinically significant increase in platelet count of >/=5000 platelets/muL and 2 had platelet count normalization. Thrombosomes doses up to 3.78 x 10(8) particles/kg demonstrated safety in 24 bleeding, thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.

As in other autoimmune disorders, the predilection for certain HLA profiles seems to represent an etiologic factor; however, in this disease the structure-function patterns involved in the self-presentation in this disease remain unclear. Herein, we analyzed the molecular landscape of HLA complexes of a cohort of 300 IAA patients and almost 3000 healthy and disease controls by deeply dissecting their genotypic configurations, functional divergence, self-antigen binding capabilities, and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire specificities. Specifically, analysis of the evolutionary divergence of HLA genotypes (HED) showed that IAA patients carried class II HLA molecules whose antigen-binding sites were characterized by a high level of structural homology, only partially explained by specific risk allele profiles. This pattern implies reduced HLA binding capabilities, confirmed by binding analysis of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived self-peptides. IAA phenotype was associated with the enrichment in a few amino acids at specific positions within the peptide-binding groove of DRB1 molecules, affecting the interface HLA-antigen-TCR beta and potentially constituting the basis of T-cell dysfunction and autoreactivity. When analyzing associations with clinical outcomes, low HED was associated with risk of malignant progression and worse survival, underlying reduced tumor surveillance in clearing potential neoantigens derived from mechanisms of clonal hematopoiesis. Our data shed light on the immunogenetic risk associated with IAA etiology and clonal evolution and on general pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved in other autoimmune disorders.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Pagliuca, Simona', 'Gurnari, Carmelo', 'Awada, Hassan', 'Kishtagari, Ashwin', 'Kongkiatkamon, Sunisa', 'Terkawi, Laila', 'Zawit, Misam', 'Guan, Yihong', 'LaFramboise, Thomas', 'Jha, Babal K', 'Patel, Bhumika J', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Lundgren, Sofie', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Chan, Timothy A', 'Yang, Chao-Yie', 'Lenz, Tobias L', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Pagliuca S', 'Gurnari C', 'Awada H', 'Kishtagari A', 'Kongkiatkamon S', 'Terkawi L', 'Zawit M', 'Guan Y', 'LaFramboise T', 'Jha BK', 'Patel BJ', 'Hamilton BK', 'Majhail NS', 'Lundgren S', 'Mustjoki S', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Visconte V', 'Chan TA', 'Yang CY', 'Lenz TL', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'University of Paris, Paris, France.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki-Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki-Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'ICAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Center for Immunotherapy and Precision Immuno-Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Research Group for Evolutionary Immunogenomics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plon, Germany;

We examined communication priorities and the quality of information exchange for Guatemalan caregivers of children with cancer during diagnostic communication. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey including items used in pediatric communication studies from high-income countries and novel questions was verbally administered to 100 caregivers of children with cancer in Guatemala. RESULTS: Guatemalan caregivers prioritized communication functions of exchanging information (99%), fostering healing relationships (98%), decision making (97%), enabling self-management (96%), and managing uncertainty (94%) over responding to emotions (66%) and cultural awareness (48%). Almost all caregivers wanted as many details as possible about their child's diagnosis and treatment (96%), likelihood of cure (99%), and late effects (97%). Only 67% were always given the information they needed without asking for it, and most caregivers sometimes (56%) or always (18%) had questions they wanted to discuss but did not. Approximately half of the caregivers (54%) correctly identified their child's diagnosis, primary site, disease extent (localized v metastatic), proposed treatment length, and treatment intent (curative v palliative). Caregivers of children with leukemia were more likely to correctly identify all attributes than those whose children had solid tumors (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Caregivers in Guatemala prioritize many of the same aspects of diagnostic communication as parents in the United States, and experience similar challenges. Shared communication values offer potential for adaptation of communication interventions across settings with varying resources and diverse cultures.",,"['Graetz, Dylan E', 'Rivas, Silvia Elena', 'Wang, Huiqi', 'Vedaraju, Yuvanesh', 'Fuentes, Ana Lucia', 'Caceres-Serrano, Annie', 'Antillon-Klussmann, Federico', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Metzger, Monika L', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Mack, Jennifer W']","['Graetz DE', 'Rivas SE', 'Wang H', 'Vedaraju Y', 'Fuentes AL', 'Caceres-Serrano A', 'Antillon-Klussmann F', 'Devidas M', 'Metzger ML', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Mack JW']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Francisco Marroquin University School of Medicine, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,IM,,,2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/11/08 17:14'],"['2021/11/08 17:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.21.00232 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2021 Sep;7:1529-1536. doi: 10.1200/GO.21.00232.,7,,1529-1536,,,PMC8577673,,"['Yuvanesh VedarajuEmployment: Lantern Pharma Meenakshi DevidasHonoraria: Novartis', 'Monika L.

Particularly, various dihydrophenanthrene, benzocoumarin and dihydrodibenzoxepin derivatives were firstly screened by the affinity chromatography-based G4-CPG assay, and the compound with the highest affinity and selectivity for G-quadruplexes (named J10) was selected for further studies. Fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism experiments corroborated its capability to selectively recognize and stabilize G-quadruplexes over duplex DNA, also showing a preference for parallel G-quadruplexes. Molecular docking proved that the selective G-quadruplex interactions over duplex interactions could be due to the ability of J10 to bind to the grooves of the telomeric and oncogene G-quadruplex structures. Finally, biological assays demonstrated that J10 induces significant antiproliferative effects on human leukemia cells, with no relevant effects on healthy human fibroblasts. Interestingly, J10 exerts its antiproliferative action on tumor cells by activating the apoptotic pathway.",,"['Platella, Chiara', 'Capasso, Domenica', 'Riccardi, Claudia', 'Musumeci, Domenica', 'DellaGreca, Marina', 'Montesarchio, Daniela']","['Platella C', 'Capasso D', 'Riccardi C', 'Musumeci D', 'DellaGreca M', 'Montesarchio D']","['Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, via Cintia, 21, 80126 Naples, Italy. dellagre@unina.it.', 'CIRPEB, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'CESTEV, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, via Cintia, 21, 80126 Naples, Italy. dellagre@unina.it.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, via Cintia, 21, 80126 Naples, Italy. dellagre@unina.it.', 'Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging (IBB) - CNR, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, via Cintia, 21, 80126 Naples, Italy. dellagre@unina.it.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, via Cintia, 21, 80126 Naples, Italy. dellagre@unina.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211125,England,Org Biomol Chem,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,101154995,IM,,,2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/11/08 12:22'],"['2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/08 12:22 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d1ob01995c [doi]'],epublish,Org Biomol Chem. 2021 Nov 25;19(45):9953-9965. doi: 10.1039/d1ob01995c.,19,45,9953-9965,,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7182-0757', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6530-605X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6295-6911']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the BCR-ABL1 dependent mechanisms, mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are the commonest cause of resistance. Material and Methods: Allele specific oligonucleotide - polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) was done for testing the six common TKD mutations, T315I, G250E, E255K, M244V, M351T, and Y253F. Results and Conclusion: TKD mutation study was done on 83 patients. Of these 44 (53%) were positive for one or more mutations. On analyzing specific mutations, E255K was the commonest mutation seen in 24 (29%) cases, followed by T315I in 23(28%) cases. Y253F mutation was not seen in the present study sample.

These microparticles were fabricated with cationic forms of either Zn, Ca, Mg, or Mn, which abound in the mammalian body. By using a CXCR4-targeted fluorescent protein as a reporter building block we categorized those cations regarding their ability to persist in the administration site and to sustain a slow release of functional protein. Ca(2+) and specially Zn(2+) have been observed as particularly good promoters of time-prolonged protein leakage. The released polypeptides result is available for selective molecular interactions, such as specific fluorescent labeling of tumor tissues, in which the protein reaches nearly steady levels.",,"['Alamo, Patricia', 'Parlade, Eloi', 'Lopez-Laguna, Hector', 'Volta-Duran, Eric', 'Unzueta, Ugutz', 'Vazquez, Esther', 'Mangues, Ramon', 'Villaverde, Antonio']","['Alamo P', 'Parlade E', 'Lopez-Laguna H', 'Volta-Duran E', 'Unzueta U', 'Vazquez E', 'Mangues R', 'Villaverde A']","['Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC Campus Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC Campus Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC Campus Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Protein materials', 'microparticles', 'protein depots', 'self-disintegrating materials', 'tumor targeting']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/11/08 12:17'],"['2021/11/08 12:17 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10717544.2021.1998249 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Deliv. 2021 Dec;28(1):2383-2391. doi: 10.1080/10717544.2021.1998249.,28,1,2383-2391,,,PMC8584089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study determined the antiallergic activity of root, leaf, and stem extracts of Japanese leaf burdock using the rat basophilic leukemia cell line. We demonstrate that the hot water extract of Japanese leaf burdock stems has a strong inhibitory effect on antigen-stimulated degranulation. This extract was further fractionated into five fractions using a glass column. The fraction obtained with 99% ethanol extracts (99% EtEx) elicits a concentration-dependent increase in degranulation inhibition. One of antiallergic compounds from the separation of components of the 99% EtEx fraction using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses had a value of m/z 393.16. From these results and those of previous studies, one of the antiallergic components was hypothesized to be onopordopicrin. Our findings demonstrate that the extract of Japanese leaf burdock exerts a strong antiallergic activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ""Japanese leaf burdock (Arctium lappa L)"" is a traditional Japanese vegetable with edible leaves and stems.

Findings: Using meta-analyses of both cohorts, genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 x 10(-8)) were identified in: recipient genomes with OS at MBNL1 (rs9990017, HR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.24-1.56, p = 3.3 x 10(-8)) and donor-recipient genotype mismatch with OS at LINC02774 (rs10927108, HR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.48, p = 2.0 x 10(-8)); donor genomes with DRM at PCNX4 (rs79076914, HR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.41-2.05, p = 3.15 x 10(-8)), LINC01194 (rs79498125, HR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.49-2.31, p = 2.84 x 10(-8)), ARID5B (rs2167710, HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.31-1.73, p = 6.9 x 10(-9)) and CT49 (rs32250, HR = 1.44, 95% CI1.26-1.64, p = 2.6 x 10(-8)); recipient genomes at PILRB with TRM (rs141591562, HR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.12, p = 1.26 x 10(-8)) and donor-recipient genotype mismatch between EPGN and MTHF2DL with TRM (rs75868097, HR = 2.66, 95% CI 1.92-3.58, p = 4.6 x 10(-9)). Results publicly available at https://fuma.ctglab.nl/browse. Interpretation: These data provide the first evidence that non-HLA common genetic variation at novel loci with biochemical function significantly impacts 1-year URD-BMT survival. Our findings have implications for donor selection, could guide treatment strategies and provide individualized risk prediction after future validation and functional studies.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of myeloid neoplasms affecting the hematopoietic stem cells characterized by recurrent genetic abnormalities, myelodysplasia (a pathological definition of abnormal bone marrow structure), ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in blood cytopenia, and a propensity to evolve into acute myelogenous leukemia. Although there is evidence that the accumulation of a set of genetic mutations is an essential event in MDS, there is an increased appreciation of the contribution of specific microenvironments, niches, in the pathogenesis of MDS and response to treatment. In physiologic hematopoiesis, niches are critical functional units that maintain hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and regulate their maturation into mature blood cells. In MDS and other hematological malignancies, altered bone marrow niches can promote the survival and expansion of mutant hematopoietic clones and provide a shield from therapy.

Great progresses have been achieved in the treatment of AML, but its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. This study reported the biological functions of lncRNA DUBR in AML pathogenic mechanism. As a result, lncRNA DUBR showed high expression level within AML, resulting in poor prognosis, especially in M4 AML. In vitro studies elucidated that knockdown of DUBR with small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the suppression of survival and colony formation ability, as well as induction of apoptosis, in AML cells. RNA pull-down assay and computational revealed that DUBR could sponge with miRNA-142-3P and interact with FUS protein. MiRNA-142-3P have a negative correlation with DUBR and overexpression of miRNA-142-3P inhibited cell growth in AML. Meanwhile, DUBR promoted the expression of FUS protein, targeting inhibition of FUS significantly promoted cell apoptosis in AML cell lines. In conclusion, these results revealed new mechanism of lncRNA DUBR in AML malignant behavior, and suggested that the manipulation of DUBR expression could serve as a potential strategy in AML therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yin, Shen, Gu, Zhang, Liu, Huang, Zhu, Zhong, Huang, Wu, Ou,', 'Zhang and Liu.']","['Yin, Zhao', 'Shen, HuiJuan', 'Gu, Chun Ming', 'Zhang, Ming Qi', 'Liu, Zhi', 'Huang, Jing', 'Zhu, Yangmin', 'Zhong, Qi', 'Huang, Yizhen', 'Wu, Feima', 'Ou, Ruiming', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Liu, Shuang']","['Yin Z', 'Shen H', 'Gu CM', 'Zhang MQ', 'Liu Z', 'Huang J', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhong Q', 'Huang Y', 'Wu F', 'Ou R', 'Zhang Q', 'Liu S']","['Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Clinical Department, Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211022,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DUBR', 'FUS', 'miRNA-142-3p', 'sponge']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:49'],"['2021/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:49 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fmolb.2021.754936 [doi]', '754936 [pii]']",epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Oct 22;8:754936. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.754936. eCollection 2021.,8,,754936,,,PMC8570042,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally named for its sequence similarity to other members of the hyaluronidase family, HYAL4 is actually a relatively distinct member of the family, particularly for its unique degradation of CS-D (2-O-, 6-O-sulphated CS) motifs and specific expression. Human HYAL4 protein expression and structural features are discussed in relation to different isoforms, activities, potential localisations and protein-protein interaction partners. CS proteoglycan targets of HYAL4 activity include: serglycin, aggrecan, CD44 and sulfatase 2, with other potential proteoglycans yet to be identified. Importantly, changes in HYAL4 expression changes in human disease have been described for testicular, bladder and kidney cancers, with gene mutations reported for several others including: leukaemia, endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, head and neck, stomach, lung and breast cancers. The HYAL4 gene also plays a role in P53 negative human cancer cell proliferation and is linked to stem cell naivety. However, its role in cancer remains relatively unexplored. Finally, current tools and techniques for the detection of specific HYAL4 activity in biological samples are critically assessed. Understanding the role of HYAL4 in human diseases will fortify our understanding of developmental processes and disease manifestation, ultimately providing novel diagnostic opportunities and therapeutic targets for drug discovery.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Maciej-Hulme.'],"['Maciej-Hulme, Marissa L']",['Maciej-Hulme ML'],"['Department of Nephrology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211020,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'catabolism', 'chondroitin sulphate', 'hydrolase', 'osteoarthritis', 'proteoglycan', 'spinal cord injury', 'stem cell']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:48'],"['2021/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.767924 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 20;9:767924. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.767924. eCollection 2021.,9,,767924,,,PMC8564380,,"['The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with B-ALL (B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), the prognosis of T-ALL is poorer, the chemotherapy is easier to fail and the relapse rate is higher. Previous studies mainly focused in Notch1-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in T-ALL. Here, we intend to investigate lncRNAs involved in T-ALL covering different subtypes. The lncRNA PPM1A-AS was screened out for its significant up-regulation in 10 T-ALL samples of different subtypes than healthy human thymus extracts. Besides, the PPM1A-AS expression levels in 3 T-ALL cell lines are markedly higher than that in CD45(+) T cells of healthy human. We further demonstrate that PPM1A-AS can promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis in vitro and can influence T-ALL growth in vivo. Finally, we verified that PPM1A-AS can regulate core proteins, Notch4, STAT3 and Akt, of 3 important signaling pathways related to T-ALL. These results confirm that lncRNA PPM1A-AS can act as an oncogene in T-ALL and maybe a potential clinical target of patients resistant to current chemotherapy or relapsed cases.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Lei, Zhang, Liu and Zhu.']","['Li, Guoli', 'Lei, Xinyue', 'Zhang, Yingchi', 'Liu, Zhe', 'Zhu, Kegan']","['Li G', 'Lei X', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Z', 'Zhu K']","['Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Immune Microenvironment and Disease of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Molecular Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Immune Microenvironment and Disease of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211021,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'Notch4', 'PPM1A-AS', 'STAT3', 'T-ALL']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:47'],"['2021/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:47 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.761205 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 21;11:761205. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.761205. eCollection 2021.,11,,761205,,,PMC8567141,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that LukS-PV, a component of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), has antileukemia activities that can induce differentiation, increase apoptosis, and inhibit proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Furthermore, LukS-PV inhibited hepatoma progression by regulating histone deacetylation, speculating that LukS-PV may exert antileukemia activity by targeting histone modification regulators. In this study, the results showed that LukS-PV induced apoptosis by downregulating the methyltransferase SET8 and its target histone H4 monomethylated at Lys 20 (H4K20me1). Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction identified the kinase PIK3CB as a downstream target gene for apoptosis mediated by SET8/H4K20me1. Finally, our results indicated that LukS-PV induced apoptosis via the PIK3CB-AKT-FOXO1 signaling pathway by targeting SET8.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) was isolated from the blood and sputum. Initial drug susceptibility testing (DST) of the blood isolate revealed resistance to isoniazid and ethambutol but the sputum isolate showed no resistance. Due to drug resistance concerns, the patient was treated with multiple second and third-line drugs, and suffered from drug side effects. To further investigate the DST discrepancies, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on both isolates. No known resistance mutations to first line or second line drugs were identified in either isolate, which was confirmed by additional susceptibility testing performed by a different reference laboratory and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) laboratory. Treatment was reduced to a simpler and less toxic regimen due to these investigations.

We report here a case of Bacillus Cereus septicemia in a child with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and present review of literature. Methods: We collected clinical, laboratory and outcome data of our patient with relapsed ALL and Bacillus Cereus infection. We reviewed literature for Bacillus Cereus infection in pediatric oncology patients by searching MED-LINE/PubMed/Google/Google Scholar/Cochrane and summarized the data obtained. Various risk factors like presence of gastrointestinal or central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, neutropenia, central venous catheter in-situ, corticosteroids use, intrathecal chemotherapy and outcomes were analyzed using Fisher Exact Chi Square test. Results: A 15-years-old boy with relapsed ALL on induction chemotherapy presented with giddiness and difficulty in breathing. He had an episode of hematemesis followed by fainting at home. He had refractory shock which did not respond to fluid boluses, inotropes and hydrocortisone. He had severe metabolic acidosis with high lactate and ammonia and died within 36-hours of onset of symptoms. His blood culture was positive for Bacillus Cereus. We came across 36 published cases of Bacillus Cereus in children with cancer including present case. Of these, 28 had acute leukemia and rest 8 had other cancers. CNS symptoms were present in 13 patients. Overall mortality was 25%. Patients with multisystem involvement had significantly higher mortality compared to those having localized disease (p-value 0.033). Conclusion: In pediatric oncology patients on chemotherapy, cultures positive for Bacillus Cereus should be considered significant.

However, a CRISPR-targeted cell population will not show a uniform genotype of the targeted gene. Instead, a mix of genotypes is generated - from wild type to different forms of insertions and deletions. Such mixed genotypes complicate analysis of the role of the targeted gene in the studied cell population. Here, we present a rapid and universal experimental approach to functionally analyze a CRISPR-targeted cell population that does not involve generating clonal lines. As a simple readout, we leverage the CRISPR-induced genetic heterogeneity and use sequencing to identify how different genotypes are enriched or depleted in relation to the studied cellular behavior or phenotype. The approach uses standard PCR, Sanger sequencing, and a simple sequence deconvoluting software, enabling laboratories without specific in-depth experience to perform these experiments. As proof of principle, we present examples studying various aspects related to hematopoietic cells (T cell development in vivo and activation in vitro, differentiation of macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as a leukemia-like phenotype induced by overexpressing a proto-oncogene). In conclusion, we present a rapid experimental approach to identify potential drug targets related to mature immune cells, as well as normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

There is strong evidence that disease progression, treatment responses, and overall clinical outcomes of CML patients are influenced by the accumulation of other genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, rather than only the BCR/ABL1 oncoprotein. Both genetic and epigenetic factors influence the efficacy of CML treatment strategies. Targeted medicines known as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved long-term survival rates in CML patients during the previous 2 decades. When compared to earlier chemotherapy treatments, these drugs have revolutionized CML treatment and allowed most people to live longer lives. Although epigenetic inhibitors' activity is disrupted in many cancers, including CML, but when combined with TKI, they may offer potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CML cells. The epigenetics of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and resistance to them is being studied, with a particular focus on imatinib, which is used to treat CML. In addition, the use of epigenetic drugs in conjunction with TKIs has been discussed. Resistance to TKIs is still a problem in curing the disease, necessitating the development of new therapies. This study focused on epigenetic pathways involved in CML pathogenesis and tumor cell resistance to TKIs, both of which contribute to leukemic clone breakout and proliferation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Amir and Javed.'],"['Amir, Mohd', 'Javed, Saleem']","['Amir M', 'Javed S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211022,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT inhibitors', 'HDAC inhibitors', 'TKI resistance', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic', 'imatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:37'],"['2021/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fgene.2021.742802 [doi]', '742802 [pii]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Oct 22;12:742802. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.742802. eCollection 2021.,12,,742802,,,PMC8569791,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the vicinity of these SNPs, four genes such as pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1), GPATCH1, MPHOSPH6, and MRM1 were identified. Four other significant SNPs (rs314787954, rs13623466, rs13910430, and rs737507850) all located on chromosome 1 were strongly (p </= 7.6E-5) associated with chicken antibody response to ND. The closest genes to these four SNPs were cell division cycle 16 (CDC16), zinc finger, BED-type containing 1 (ZBED1), myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (MX1), and growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) related adaptor protein 2 (GRAP2). Besides, other SNPs and genes suggestively (p </= 1.5E-5) associated with BW and antibody response to ND were reported. This work offers a useful entry point for the discovery of causative genes accountable for essential QTLs regulating BW and antibody response to ND traits. Results provide auspicious genes and SNP-based markers that can be used in the improvement of growth performance and ND resistance in IC populations based on gene-based and/or marker-assisted breeding selection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Habimana, Ngeno, Okeno, Hirwa, Keambou Tiambo and Yao.']","['Habimana, Richard', 'Ngeno, Kiplangat', 'Okeno, Tobias Otieno', ""Hirwa, Claire D' Andre"", 'Keambou Tiambo, Christian', 'Yao, Nasser Kouadio']","['Habimana R', 'Ngeno K', 'Okeno TO', 'Hirwa CA', 'Keambou Tiambo C', 'Yao NK']","['College of Agriculture, Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Animal Breeding and Genomics Group, Department of Animal Science, Egerton University, Egerton, Kenya.', 'Animal Breeding and Genomics Group, Department of Animal Science, Egerton University, Egerton, Kenya.', 'Animal Breeding and Genomics Group, Department of Animal Science, Egerton University, Egerton, Kenya.', 'Rwanda Agricultural and Animal Resources Development Board, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health, International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Biosciences Eastern and Central Africa - International Livestock Research Institute (BecA-ILRI) Hub, Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210816,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['genome-wide association studies', 'growth performance', 'indigenous chicken', 'putative gene', 'quantitative trait loci', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:37'],"['2021/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.723980 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Aug 16;12:723980. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.723980. eCollection 2021.,12,,723980,,,PMC8570395,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The successes of immunotherapies treating solid tumors and a deeper understanding of the immune systems of patients with hematologic malignancies have promoted the development of immunotherapies for the treatment of AML. And high tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an emerging predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy. However, the association of gene mutation in AML with TMB and immunological features still has not been clearly elucidated. In our study, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and BeatAML cohorts, 20 frequently mutated genes were found to be covered by both datasets in AML. And TP53 mutation was associated with a poor prognosis, and its mutation displayed exclusiveness with other common mutated genes in both datasets. Moreover, TP53 mutation correlated with TMB and the immune microenvironment. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that TP53 mutation upregulated signaling pathways involved in the immune system. In summary, TP53 mutation is frequently mutated in AML, and its mutation is associated with dismal outcome, TMB, and immunological features, which may serve as a biomarker to predict immune response in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wen, Xu, Jin, Xia, Ma, Qian, Lin and Qian.']","['Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Jin, Ye', 'Xia, Pei-Hui', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Qian, Wei', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Wen XM', 'Xu ZJ', 'Jin Y', 'Xia PH', 'Ma JC', 'Qian W', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211021,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*TP53', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*mutation', '*prognosis', '*tumor mutational burden', '*tumor-infiltrating immune cells']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/11/08 06:36'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.717527 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 21;12:717527. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.717527. eCollection 2021.,12,,717527,20211220,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC8566372,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results obtained herein are the basis for the development of a front microrheometry point-of-care device for the diagnosis and clinical follow-up of beta-TT patients suffering hematological diseases and alterations in the morphology of the red blood cell (RBC). The viscosity is calculated as a function of the mean front velocity by detecting the sample fluid-air interface advancing through a microfluidic channel. Different viscosity curves are obtained for healthy donors, beta-TT and IDA samples. A mathematical model is introduced to compare samples of distinct hematocrit, classifying the viscosity curve patterns with respect to the health condition of blood. The viscosity of the fluid at certain shear rate values varies depending on several RBC factors such as shape and size, hemoglobin (Hb) content, membrane rigidity and hematocrit concentration. Blood and plasma from healthy donors are used as reference. To validate their potential clinical value as a diagnostic tool, the viscosity results are compared to those obtained by the gold-standard method for RBC deformability evaluation, the Laser-Optical Rotational Red Cell Analyzer (LoRRCA).","['Copyright (c) 2021 Mendez-Mora, Cabello-Fusares, Ferre-Torres, Riera-Llobet,', 'Krishnevskaya, Trejo-Soto, Payan-Pernia, Hernandez-Rodriguez, Morales-Indiano,', 'Alarcon, Vives-Corrons and Hernandez-Machado.']","['Mendez-Mora, Lourdes', 'Cabello-Fusares, Maria', 'Ferre-Torres, Josep', 'Riera-Llobet, Carla', 'Krishnevskaya, Elena', 'Trejo-Soto, Claudia', 'Payan-Pernia, Salvador', 'Hernandez-Rodriguez, Ines', 'Morales-Indiano, Cristian', 'Alarcon, Tomas', 'Vives-Corrons, Joan-Lluis', 'Hernandez-Machado, Aurora']","['Mendez-Mora L', 'Cabello-Fusares M', 'Ferre-Torres J', 'Riera-Llobet C', 'Krishnevskaya E', 'Trejo-Soto C', 'Payan-Pernia S', 'Hernandez-Rodriguez I', 'Morales-Indiano C', 'Alarcon T', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Hernandez-Machado A']","['Department of Condensed Matter Physics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Red Cell Pathology and Hematopoietic Disorders (Rare Anemias) Unit, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Instituto de Fisica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.', 'Red Blood Cell Disorders Unit, Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS/CSIC), Seville, Spain.', ""Hematology Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital, Badalona, Spain."", 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Laboratori Clinic Metropolitana Nord, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament de Matematiques, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Red Cell Pathology and Hematopoietic Disorders (Rare Anemias) Unit, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211021,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,['NOTNLM'],"['anemia', 'beta-thalassemia trait', 'blood rheology', 'hemorheology', 'iron deficiency (anemia)', 'microfluidics', 'microrheometer', 'rheology']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:34'],"['2021/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2021.761411 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2021 Oct 21;12:761411. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2021.761411. eCollection 2021.,12,,761411,,,PMC8566979,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

Orally administered small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of members of the BCR signaling pathway have proven to be transformational in treatment of CLL. The first-generation inhibitor, ibrutinib, covalently binds to the C481 amino acid of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), thereby irreversibly inhibiting its kinase activity, and interferes with the biology of the cells, ultimately resulting in CLL cell death and therapeutic response. Remissions are not deep to the point of considering discontinuation for most patients, but BTK-inhibitor-based therapy provides exceptional long-term disease control with continuous treatment. There are in-class toxicities and more selective second- and subsequent-generation agents and reversible inhibitors have been developed with the intent of reducing toxicities. Also, strategies to subvert resistance have included tighter or alternative, non-covalent, inhibitor binding. Furthermore, other strategies to deplete BTK protein, such as degraders, are in development and being tested in the clinic. Ultimately, the development and approval of these agents targeting BTK have ushered in a new era of chemotherapy-free treatments with remarkably improved survival outcomes for patients with CLL.",['(c) 2021 Tambaro et al.'],"['Tambaro, Francesco Paolo', 'De Novellis, Danilo', 'Wierda, William G']","['Tambaro FP', 'De Novellis D', 'Wierda WG']","['Unita Operativa di Trapianto di Midollo Osseo e Servizio Trasfusionale, Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, Napoli, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa di Trapianto di Midollo Osseo e Servizio Trasfusionale, Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""L.

Serum VEGF, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay at diagnosis (day 0) and at the end of induction phase (day 35) in 30 newly diagnosed paediatric ALL patients and in 10 healthy controls. Median s-VEGF was significantly lower at day 0 as compared to day 35 (196.15 vs. 606.75 pg/ml: p < 0.001). s-VEGFR-1 levels were detectable only in 7 patients at day 0 and were below detection level at day 35 in all patients. Median s-VEGFR-2 at day 0 was significantly lower as compared to day 35 (17,577.5 vs. 20,507.5 pg/ml; p = 0.005). Median VEGF-R1 showed an inverse relationship with VEGF-R2 but was statistically insignificant. All patients were in remission at the end of induction. Thus, leukemic infiltration of bone marrow affects angiogenesis and reduces pro-angiogenic markers VEGF and VEGFR-2 in serum possibly due to increased local consumption by blasts. A successful induction leads to clearing of blasts causing restoration of normal hematopoiesis with normalization of VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels.",['(c) Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion 2021.'],"['Meena, Rachana', 'Nangia, Anita', 'Sharma, Sunita', 'Chandra, Jagdish']","['Meena R', 'Nangia A', 'Sharma S', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.415723.6', 'Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.415723.6', 'Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.415723.6', 'Department of Paediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.415723.6']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210223,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Paediatric ALL', 'VEGF', 'VEGFR2']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:28'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/11/08 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-021-01413-0 [doi]', '1413 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Oct;37(4):586-592. doi: 10.1007/s12288-021-01413-0.

This study is aimed to ascertain the outcome of children with APL using similar approach. A total of 30 patients with APL, registered from January 2015 to December 2018, were reviewed. Diagnosis was established on bone marrow aspirate and confirmed by the presence of PML-RARA translocation. Treatment protocol was based on Australian APML 4 study performed by Australian Leukemia Lymphoma Group (ALLG). Lumbar puncture was not performed as it was not part of the protocol due to the risk of bleeding. The mean age in current cohort was 9 years with 53% males. Seven (23.3%) patients died and three (10%) abandoned treatment during induction. Twenty patients completed the intensive phase of chemotherapy and all (100%) of them attained molecular remission (MR). One patient dropped out after MR whereas, 19 remain on follow up with no evidence of disease, reflecting disease free survival (DFS) of 95%. With a median follow up of 2.5 years (range 2.1-4.8 years) the 5 years Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS was 63% and 73%, with and without abandonment, respectively. Analysis of outcome according to risk groups revealed inferior outcome of high risk (HR) group (38% and 50% with and without abandonment, respectively) in contrast to standard risk (SR) group which showed better outcome (82% and 88% with and without abandonment, respectively). The attainment of 100% molecular remission and absence of relapse supports the effectiveness of this regimen.

Although a number of recurrent fusion genes are reported in T-ALL, their involvement in disease stratification and therapeutic intervention is still controversial. Considering the prognostic value of STIL-TAL1 fusion and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) based therapeutic potential of NUP214-ABL1, the present study aimed to investigate their frequency and clinical correlation in pediatric T-ALL cases. Our cohort consisted of 48 T-ALL pediatric cases (age </= 12 years) with a median age of 6 years and male to female ratio of 20.5:1. The median TLC of the study group was noted to be 220,000/ cu mm with a range from 26,810/cu mm to 785,430/cu mm. By MLPA and RT-PCR analysis we observed that 11/48 cases (23%) showed STIL-TAL1 fusion and 4/48 cases (8.3%) had NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene. Both of the fusion genes did not show any significant correlation with any of the clinico-hematological or treatment outcome parameters. However, upon analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) with other clinically relevant genes, we found significant correlation between LEF1 (p = 0.024) and PTEN (p = 0.049) gene deletions with STIL/TAL1 fusion in T-ALL patients. NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene did not reveal any association with either CNVs or with survival. Although limited with the small cohort size and follow up, our study supports the similar frequency of these fusions as compared to other Asian and Western studies and also highlights utility of MLPA technique as a good diagnostic modality to screen for both STIL-TAL1 and NUP214-ABL1 fusions in a single assay with additional data on secondary copy number changes.",['(c) Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion 2021.'],"['Patra, Nilamani', 'Singh, Minu', 'Sharma, Pankaj', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Bansal, Deepak', 'Bhatia, Prateek']","['Patra N', 'Singh M', 'Sharma P', 'Trehan A', 'Naseem S', 'Bansal D', 'Bhatia P']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767 2903']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210125,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLPA', 'NUP214-ABL1', 'STIL-TAL1', 'T-ALL']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:01,['2021/11/08 06:28'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/11/08 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01394-6 [doi]', '1394 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Oct;37(4):555-562. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01394-6.

Therapy related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is a better defined disease entity than therapy related acute lymphoid leukemia (t-ALL). However, in recent times, t-ALL is also being increasingly recognized and extensively studied. Therapy related acute myeloid leukemia is usually classified together with therapy related myelodysplastic syndrome. However, the management of these two diseases maybe different regarding needs of induction chemotherapy and eligibility for upfront allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo HSCT). There is also evidence regarding differences in prognosis and outcomes between these two entities. Allo HSCT offers a potential for cure in t-AML and t-ALL. However, existing literature on the same is confounded by inclusion of t-MDS and secondary acute leukemias. Here we review the current evidence on the outcomes and predictors of outcomes of Allo HSCT in the management of therapy related acute leukemias. We also shed light into the under-representation of therapy related leukemias in clinical trials.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of allo-HSCTs from different donor types for Ph(+) ALL patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: Studies in EMBASE and MEDLINE between inception and December 2020 were identified using search terms related to ""Ph(+) ALL"" and ""HSCT."" Eligible studies were studies with Ph(+) ALL patients who received a TKI and allo-HSCT. The primary outcomes of interest-the overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS)-needed to be reported. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to combine the effect estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each donor type. RESULTS: Fourteen cohort studies were identified for the meta-analysis. Haploidentical (HID)-HSCT for Ph(+) ALL patients resulted in a superior RFS to MD-HSCT, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.05-2.32; I(2) = 0%). However, HID-HSCT and MD-HSCT had comparable OS. Furthermore, HID-HSCT group had a significantly lower relapse rate than MD-HSCT group. On the other hand, the risks of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were higher for HID-HSCT and pooled OR of chronic GvHD rate. The OS and RFS of matched sibling-HSCT, matched unrelated-HSCT, and cord blood-HSCT were comparable with those of HID-HSCT. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that HID-HSCT is as effective as MD-HSCT in Ph(+) ALL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

AML is a complex disease, and understanding its pathophysiology is contributing to the improvement in the treatment and prognosis of AML. In this study, we assessed the expression profile and molecular functions of CCAAT enhancer binding protein gamma (CEBPG), a gene implicated in myeloid differentiation and AML progression. METHODS: shRNA mediated gene interference was used to down-regulate the expression of CEBPG in AML cell lines, and knockdown efficiency was detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The effect of knockdown on the growth of AML cell lines was evaluated by CCK-8. Western blotting was used to detect PARP cleavage, and flow cytometry were used to determine the effect of knockdown on apoptosis of AML cells. Genes and pathways affected by knockdown of CEBPG were identified by gene expression analysis using RNA-seq. One of the genes affected by knockdown of CEBPG was Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1), a known repressor of translation. Knockdown of EIF4EBP1 was used to assess its potential role in AML progression downstream of CEBPG. RESULTS: We explored the ChIP-Seq data of AML cell lines and non-AML hematopoietic cells, and found CEBPG was activated through its distal enhancer in AML cell lines. Using the public transcriptomic dataset, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and western blotting, we also found CEBPG was overexpressed in AML. Moreover, we observed that CEBPG promotes AML cell proliferation by activating EIF4EBP1, thus contributing to the progression of AML. These findings indicate that CEBPG could act as a potential therapeutic target for AML patients. CONCLUSION: In summary, we systematically explored the molecular characteristics of CEBPG in AML and identified CEBPG as a potential therapeutic target for AML patients. Our findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of AML and indicate a key role for CEBPG in promoting AML progression.",['(c) 2021.

The importance of this interaction is increasingly being recognized as a potentially important target for future drug discoveries and developments. Recent innovations in the high throughput drug screening-related technologies, novel ex-vivo disease-models, and freely available machine-learning algorithms are advancing the drug discovery process by targeting earlier undruggable proteins, complex pathways, as well as physical interactions (e.g. leukemic cell-bone microenvironment interaction). AREA COVERED: In this review, the authors discuss the recent methodological advancements and existing challenges to target specialized hematopoietic niches within the bone marrow during leukemia and suggest how such methods can be used to identify drugs targeting leukemic cell-bone microenvironment interactions. EXPERT OPINION: The recent development in cell-cell communication scoring technology and culture conditions can speed up the drug discovery by targeting the cell-microenvironment interaction. However, to accelerate this process, collecting clinical-relevant patient tissues, developing culture model systems, and implementing computational algorithms, especially trained to predict drugs and their combination targeting the cancer cell-bone microenvironment interaction are needed.",,"['Giri, Anil K', 'Ianevski, Aleksander']","['Giri AK', 'Ianevski A']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211108,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer cell -microenvironment interaction', 'drug combination', 'high content microscopy']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/11/08 05:31'],"['2021/11/08 05:31 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/17460441.2022.1991306 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2021 Nov 8:1-10. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2022.1991306.,,,1-10,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0941-1458'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia subtypes with hallmark overexpression of HOXA9 include those carrying MLL gene rearrangements, NPM1c mutations, and other genetic alternations. A growing body of evidence indicates that HOXA9 dysregulation is both sufficient and necessary for leukemic transformation. The HOXA9 mRNA and protein regulation includes multilayered controls by transcription factors (such as CDX2/4 and USF2/1), epigenetic factors (such as MLL-menin-LEDGF, DOT1L, ENL, HBO1, NPM1c-XPO1, and polycomb proteins), microRNAs (such as miR-126 and miR-196b), long noncoding RNAs (such as HOTTIP), three-dimensional chromatin interactions, and post-translational protein modifications. Recently, insights into the dynamic regulation of HOXA9 have led to an advanced understanding of the HOXA9 regulome and provided new cancer therapeutic opportunities, including developing inhibitors targeting DOT1L, menin, and ENL proteins.

We have recently reported promising efficacy results in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with combination therapy with the PI3Kdeltagamma inhibitor duvelisib and fludarabine cyclophosphamide rituximab (FCR) chemoimmunotherapy, but approximately one-third of patients develop autoimmune toxicity. We show here that duvelisib FCR treatment in an upfront setting modulates both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Decreases in naive and central memory CD4 T cells and naive CD8 T cells occur with treatment, while activated CD8 T cells, granzyme positive Tregs, and Th17 CD4 and CD8 T cells all increase with treatment, particularly in patients with toxicity. Cytokines associated with Th17 activation (IL-17A and IL-21) are also relatively elevated in patients with toxicity. The only CLL feature associated with toxicity was increased priming for apoptosis at baseline, with a significant decrease during the first week of duvelisib. We conclude that an increase in activated CD8 T cells with activation of Th17 T cells, in the context of lower baseline Tregs and greater CLL resistance to duvelisib, is associated with duvelisib-related autoimmune toxicity.","['(c) 2021.

We studied the effect of CD109 knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) on TF-1, a myeloid leukemia cell line that expresses CD109, and primary human HSPCs. CD109-KO or KD TF-1 cells underwent erythroid differentiation in the presence of TGF-beta. CD109 was more abundantly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) than in multipotent progenitors and HSPCs of human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood but was not detected in mouse HSCs. Erythroid differentiation was induced by TGF-beta to a greater extent in CD109-KD cord blood or iPS cell-derived megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEPs) than in wild-type MEPs. When we analyzed the phenotype of peripheral blood MEPs of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who had both GPI(+) and GPI(-) CD34(+) cells, the CD36 expression was more evident in CD109(-) MEPs than CD109(+) MEPs. In summary, CD109 suppresses TGF-beta signaling in HSPCs, and the lack of CD109 may increase the sensitivity of PIGA-mutated HSPCs to TGF-beta, thus leading to the preferential commitment of erythroid progenitor cells to mature red blood cells in immune-mediated BM failure.","['(c) 2021.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the roles of Megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) and its regulation of COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) in HCC cells. METHODS: MKL1 expression in clinical tissues and cell lines were detected by bioinformatics, qRT-PCR and western blot. MKL1 expression in HCC cells were silenced with siRNA, followed by cell proliferation evaluation via Edu staining and colony formation, migration and invasion using the Transwell system, and apoptosis by Hoechst staining. HCC cell tumorigenesis was assessed by cancer cell line-based xenograft model, combined with H&E staining and IHC assays. RESULTS: MKL1 expression was elevated in HCC cells and clinical tissues which was correlated with poor prognosis. MKL1 silencing significantly repressed proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation but enhanced apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells. MKL1 silencing also inhibited COMPASS components and p65 protein expression in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells. HepG2 cell tumorigenesis in nude mice was severely impaired by MKL1 knockdown, resulted into suppressed Ki67 expression and cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: MKL1 promotes HCC pathogenesis by regulating hepatic cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis via the COMPASS complex and NF-kappaB signaling.",['(c) 2021.

Drug adherence was evaluated according to the medication possession ratio (MPR) and classified as high adherence (i.e., MPR >/= 0.95 [upper 50%]), moderate adherence (i.e., MPR >/= 0.68 and < 0.95 [middle 25%]), and low adherence (i.e., MPR < 0.68 [lower 25%]). RESULTS: The median MPR was 0.95 (range, 0 to 4.67). Male sex (p = 0.003), age < 70 years (p < 0.001), high income (>/= 30%, p < 0.001), and maintaining frontline TKI (< 0.001) were associated with better adherence. Adherence to dasatinib was the lowest (vs. imatinib or nilotinib, p < 0.001). Compared with high MPR patients, those with moderate MPR (hazard ratio [HR], 4.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.87 to 6.19; p < 0.001) and low MPR (HR, 11.6; 95% CI, 9.35 to 14.42; p < 0.001) had poorer OS. CONCLUSION: Adherence to TKI treatment is an important factor predicting survival outcomes in Korean CML patients. Male sex, age < 70 years, high income, and maintaining frontline TKI are associated with high adherence to TKI. Thus, those without these characteristics should be closely monitored for treatment adherence.",,"['Kim, Yundeok', 'Go, Tae-Hwa', 'Jang, Jaeyeon', 'Lee, Jii Bum', 'Lim, Seung Taek', 'Shim, Kwang Yong', 'Lee, Jong In', 'Kong, Jee Hyun']","['Kim Y', 'Go TH', 'Jang J', 'Lee JB', 'Lim ST', 'Shim KY', 'Lee JI', 'Kong JH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Department of Biostatics, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Cancer of Evidence Based Medicine, Institute of Convergence Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211101,Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Adherence', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Medication possession ratio', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/11/08 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/07 19:37'],"['2021/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/07 19:37 [entrez]', '2021/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['kjim.2021.158 [pii]', '10.3904/kjim.2021.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2021 Nov;36(6):1450-1458. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2021.158.

It is mainly characterized by defect migration and invasion of trophoblast cells. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been widely reported to be associated with PE progression. This study is designed to explore the role and mechanism of circ_0032962 on trophoblast cell behavior. Circ_0032962, microRNA-326 (miR-326), and Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) levels were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell proliferation ability, migration, and invasion were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), Colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. Protein levels of E-cadherin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, and PBX3 were examined by western blot assay. The binding relationship between miR-326 and circ_0032962 or PBX3 was predicted by circular RNA Interactome or Starbase and then verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ_0032962 and PBX3 levels were declined in placenta tissues from preeclampsia patients, and miR-326 was elevated. Apart from that, circ_0032962 knockdown could suppress cell proliferation ability, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in trophoblast cells. Mechanically, circ_0032962 could affect PBX3 expression through sponging miR-326. Circ_0032962 could contribute to trophoblast cell growth ability and metastasis partly by regulating the miR-326/PBX3 axis, providing a novel insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of PE.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal', 'Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.', 'Published by Elsevier B.V.

We retrospectively analyzed rare possibly significant variations (PSVs) in the five most obligated FA genes, BRCA2, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, and FANCG, in 788 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and hematologic malignancy. Sixty-eight variants were identified in 66 patients (8.38%). FANCA was the most frequently mutated gene (n = 29), followed by BRCA2 (n = 20). Compared with that of the ExAC East Asian dataset, the overall frequency of rare PSVs was higher in our cohort (P = 0.016). BRCA2 PSVs showed higher frequency in acute lymphocytic leukemia (P = 0.038), and FANCA PSVs were significantly enriched in AA and AML subgroups (P = 0.020; P = 0.008). FA-PSV-positive MDS/AML patients had a higher tumor mutation burden, higher rate of cytogenetic abnormalities, less epigenetic regulation, and fewer spliceosome gene mutations than those of FA-PSV-negative MDS/AML patients (P = 0.024, P = 0.029, P = 0.024, and P = 0.013).

Accordingly, it has become an important target for novel treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B-cell leukaemia. Three anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action have been developed for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. METHODS: We reviewed the preclinical and clinical data on the development of the newly approved anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies blinatumomab, tafasitamab and loncastuximab tesirine, and consider their place in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. RESULTS: Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager that binds to both CD19 on B cells and CD3 on T cells, facilitating antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Blinatumomab significantly prolongs overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, although cytokine release syndrome and severe neurotoxicity may necessitate discontinuation. Tafasitamab, which has modified anti-CD19 Fab and Fc regions, has significantly enhanced affinity for both CD19 and effector cell receptors compared with unmodified anti-CD19. In L-MIND, tafasitamab plus lenalidomide provided an overall response rate (ORR) of 57.5% in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in patients non-transplant eligible. Loncastuximab tesirine is an antibody-drug conjugate that has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with ibrutinib in 3L + relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The ORR was 48.3% in a phase II trial of loncastuximab tesirine. The optimal place of anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies in therapy has yet to be determined, but the prospect of improved outcomes for at least some patients with treatment-resistant B-cell malignancies appears likely, particularly in those with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis.",['(c) 2021.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: In this epidemiologic survey, we describe clinical characteristics and outcome of 125 consecutive pBSI occurred in oncohematological patients. Polymicrobial bloodstream infections (pBSI) were defined with the isolation of 2 or more bacteria from blood culture specimens obtained within 72 h. RESULTS: Over an 11-year period, we documented 500 bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) in 4542 hospital admissions and 25% (125) of these were pBSI. Most common underlying hematological disease was acute myeloid leukemia and 89% of patients had severe neutropenia. Fifty pBSI (40%) occurred in patients undergoing a stem cell transplantation (SCT), mostly within 30 days from transplant (42/50-84%). Principal bacterial association was Gram-positive plus Gram-negative (57%). Resolution rate of pBSI was 82%, without differences between SCT and non-SCT cases. pBSI-related mortality was 15% (6% in SCT cases). Septic shock occurred in 16% of cases and septic shock-related mortality was 65% (75% in SCT cases and 63% in non-SCT cases; p = 0.6). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were involved in 22% of pBSI and the MDR-pBSI-related mortality was significantly higher in SCT patients (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study highlights that pBSI is not a rare bloodstream infectious complication in oncohematological patients. pBSI-related mortality is lower than 20%, but, if septic shock occurs, mortality reaches 65%. MDR bacteria were involved in 22% of cases and pBSI-MDR-related mortality was significantly higher in SCT patients.","['(c) 2021.

Ferroptosis, an iron-induced programmed cell death, is a promising target for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, not much is known about the relationship between ferroptosis-related genes and AML prognosis. Herein, we retrieved RNA profile and corresponding clinical data of AML patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Univariate Cox analysis was employed to identify ferroptosis-related genes significantly associated with AML prognosis. Next, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to establish a prognostic ferroptosis-related gene profile. 12 ferroptosis-related genes were screened to generate a prognostic model, which stratified patients into a low- (LR) or high-risk (HR) group. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we demonstrated that the LR patients exhibited better prognosis than HR patients. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that the prognostic model showed good predictability. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Treg) differed vastly between the LR and HR groups. Our prognostic model can offer guidance into the accurate prediction of AML prognosis and selection of personalized therapy in clinical practice.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the tumor-suppressing activities of miR-139 and molecular mechanisms of MIR139-silencing remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the poorly prognostic MLL-AF9 fusion protein-expressing AML. We show that MLL-AF9 expression in hematopoietic precursors caused epigenetic silencing of MIR139, whereas overexpression of MIR139 inhibited in vitro and in vivo AML outgrowth. We identified novel miR-139 targets that mediate the tumor-suppressing activities of miR-139 in MLL-AF9 AML. We revealed that two enhancer regions control MIR139 expression and found that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) downstream of MLL-AF9 epigenetically silenced MIR139 in AML. Finally, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen revealed RNA Polymerase 2 Subunit M (POLR2M) as a novel MIR139-regulatory factor. Our findings elucidate the molecular control of tumor suppressor MIR139 and reveal a role for POLR2M in the MIR139-silencing mechanism, downstream of MLL-AF9 and PRC2 in AML. In addition, we confirmed these findings in human AML cell lines with different oncogenic aberrations, suggesting that this is a more common oncogenic mechanism in AML. Our results may pave the way for new targeted therapy in AML.",['(c) 2021.

The JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib can reduce constitutional symptoms but it does not substantially improve bone marrow fibrosis. Pim1 expression is significantly elevated in MPN/MF hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we show that genetic ablation of Pim1 blocked the development of myelofibrosis induced by Jak2V617F and MPLW515L. Pharmacologic inhibition of Pim1 with a second-generation Pim kinase inhibitor TP-3654 significantly reduced leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and attenuated bone marrow fibrosis in Jak2V617F and MPLW515L mouse models of MF. Combined treatment of TP-3654 and Ruxolitinib resulted in greater reduction of spleen size, normalization of blood leukocyte counts and abrogation of bone marrow fibrosis in murine models of MF. TP-3654 treatment also preferentially inhibited Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic progenitors in mice. Mechanistically, we show that TP-3654 treatment significantly inhibits mTORC1, MYC and TGF-beta signaling in Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic cells and diminishes the expression of fibrotic markers in the bone marrow. Collectively, our results suggest that Pim1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MF, and inhibition of Pim1 with TP-3654 might be useful for treatment of MF.","['(c) 2021.

We applied 2x150PE sequencing, >150M reads/sample on Illumina NovaSeq6000. We show that PA outperforms RD for the analysis of gene expression and structural aberrations. RD is more suitable for detection of various classes of RNAs, mutations or polymorphisms.

Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, plays an important role in tumor cell metabolism and proliferation. It is also specifically overexpressed in leukemia cells and contributes to leukemic proliferation, differentiation, and drug resistance through both aerobic glycolysis and non-metabolic pathways. In this review, the functions and regulatory roles of PKM2 are firstly introduced. Then, the molecular mechanisms of PKM2 in leukemogenesis are summarized. Next, reported PKM2 modulators and their anti-leukemia mechanisms are described. Finally, the current challenges and the potential opportunities of PKM2 inhibitors or agonists in leukemia therapy are discussed.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the French Public Health Council (FPHC) and the 7th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL7) recommendations, vaccination coverage remains insufficient. This study aimed to estimate the coverage and determinants of influenza, pneumococcal and diphtheria-tetanus-poliomyelitis (dTP) vaccinations in hematological patients underlying chemotherapy. METHODS: A survey was distributed to all patients of the hematology day hospital assessing vaccine uptakes and general opinion about vaccination. Vaccine uptakes were collected from medical and vaccination records; knowledge of and attitudes towards vaccinations in immunocompromised patients were evaluated for each general practitioner (GP) by phone call. Adequacy between vaccine uptakes and indication or not to vaccinate according to ECIL7 guidelines was assessed. Factors associated with vaccine uptakes were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 145 patients, 66 % were aged 65 years or older, 40 % were followed for lymphoma and 38 % for multiple myeloma, 39 % were treated with anti-CD20 antibodies. Vaccination coverage was suboptimal for influenza (45-56 %), dTP (44 %) and IPD (16-19 %) regardless of the guidelines followed, with a wide variation in rates by information source (19-76 %). Adequacy rate with ECIL7 recommendations were 63 % and 87 % for influenza and IPD respectively. Information of patients on specific vaccinations was positively associated with flu and IPD vaccinations, as well as favorable attitude toward vaccination and age >/= 65 years for flu vaccination, and recommendation by hematologist for pneumococcal vaccination. CONCLUSION: Despite vaccination opportunities, the complexity of these specific recommendations and the lack of communication between the health actors could explain the suboptimal vaccination coverage in this high-risk population. A proactive attitude of all actors in the city and hospital, including better patient information and a personalized and evolving vaccination schedule to help GPs to coordinate vaccination would allow to improve vaccine coverage.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the widely used monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, was comprehensively examined to understand mechanistic relationships between the 3D chromatin structure and transcription during the trans-differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. To corroborate these observations in primary cells, we analyze in situ Hi-C and RNA-seq data of human primary monocytes and their differentiated macrophages in comparison to that obtained from the monocytic/macrophagic THP-1 cells. Surprisingly, we find significant differences between the primary cells and the THP-1 cells at all levels of chromatin structure, from loops to topologically associated domains to compartments. Importantly, the compartment-level differences correlate significantly with transcription: those genes that are in A-compartments in the primary cells but are in B-compartments in the THP-1 cells exhibit a higher level of expression in the primary cells than in the THP-1 cells, and vice versa. Overall, the genes in these different compartments are enriched for a wide range of pathways, and, at least in the case of the monocytic cells, their altered expression in certain pathways in the THP-1 cells argues for a less immune cell-like phenotype, suggesting that immortalization or prolonged culturing of THP-1 caused a divergence of these cells from their primary counterparts. It is thus essential to reexamine phenotypic details observed in cell lines with their primary counterparts so as to ensure a proper understanding of functional cell states in vivo.",['(c) 2021.

This case report presents his journey and that of his caregivers, and the challenges they faced as patient and parents in pursuit of optimal quality of life during the survivorship period. The case study emphasizes not only the challenges faced by patients but also identified gaps in post-hematopoietic cell transplantation care service delivery. Furthermore, the case study also highlights the importance of involving caregivers in post-transplant care and having a better communication process and service facilitation process throughout the journey of the patient and their carer.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,10.1007/s11764-021-01122-7 [doi],"PURPOSE: Existing research hints that people living with and beyond cancer are at an increased risk of stroke. However, there is insufficient evidence to appropriately inform guidelines for specific stroke prevention or management for cancer patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe and quantify stroke incidence in people living with and beyond cancer. METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched for epidemiological studies comparing stroke incidence between cancer and non-cancer patients. Reviewers independently extracted data; random-effects meta-analyses and quality assessment were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were narratively synthesised. Meta-analysis was conducted using seven studies. Methodological quality was high for most studies. Study populations were heterogeneous, and the length of follow-up and risk factors varied. There was a variation in risk between different cancer types and according to stroke type: pancreatic (HR 2.85 (95% CI 2.43-3.36), ischaemic) (HR 2.28 (95% CI 1.43-3.63), haemorrhagic); lung (HR 2.33 (95% CI 1.63-3.35), ischaemic) (HR 2.14 (95% CI 1.45-3.15), haemorrhagic); and head and neck (HR 1.54 (95% CI 1.40-1.69), haemorrhagic) cancers were associated with significantly increased incidence of stroke. Risk is highest within the first 6 months of diagnosis. Narrative synthesis indicated that several studies also showed significantly increased incidence of stroke in individuals with colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, leukaemia, and myeloma, and those who have received radiotherapy for head and neck cancers and platinum-based chemotherapy may also have higher stroke incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke incidence is significantly increased after diagnosis of certain cancers.

We developed a less-toxic conditioning regimen for CBT that achieves a higher rate of complete donor chimerism, and retrospectively compared it against two other conditioning regimens for CBT performed at our single institution. The engraftment rate with complete donor chimerism was 100% and 5-year event-free survival (5y-EFS) was 90.9% in patients using our latest regimen (n = 11) of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) containing fludarabine (Flu) 180 mg/m(2), melphalan (MEL) 210 mg/m(2), and low-dose rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (LD-rATG) 2.5 mg/kg without irradiation (regimen C). Outcomes were better than in patients (n = 10) treated with previous regimens involving irradiation (5y-EFS 30.0%, p = 0.004): regimen A, consisting of myeloablative conditioning containing cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) with 8-12 Gy, or regimen B, consisting of RIC with Flu, CY, horse ATG, and thoracoabdominal irradiation (TAI) with 6 Gy.

In this study, 120 ascitic fluid samples from FIP-suspected cats were collected from veterinary hospitals in 21 provinces in China between 2019 and 2021. One hundred nine samples were positive for feline coronavirus (FCoV), with no feline immunodeficiency virus infections and one feline leukemia virus infection (1/109, 0.92%). The prevalence of FCoV was significantly associated with age (p < 0.01) and was not highly associated with gender, breed, geographical location, or viral coinfection (p > 0.01). One unique strain, SD/202012/003, contained a six-nucleotide deletion in the spike gene. Sequence analysis showed that 94.68% (89/94) of the isolates had a mutation of methionine to leucine at position 1058 in the spike protein. The epidemiological data obtained of FCoV in this study may be beneficial for clinical monitoring of FCoV in China.","['(c) 2021.

Herein, efficacy and safety of venetoclax-azacitidine are analyzed in the Japanese subgroup of VIALE-A patients. METHODS: Eligible Japanese patients were randomized 2:1 to venetoclax-azacitidine (N = 24) or placebo-azacitidine (N = 13). Primary endpoints for Japan were overall survival and complete response (CR) + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Venetoclax (target dose 400 mg) was given orally once daily. Azacitidine (75 mg/m2) was administered subcutaneously or intravenously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 16.3 months (range, 1.0-20.3). Median overall survival was not reached with venetoclax-azacitidine (hazard ratio 0.409 and 95% confidence interval: 0.151, 1.109); overall survival estimate was higher with venetoclax-azacitidine than placebo-azacitidine at 12 (67 and 46%) and 18 months (57 and 31%), respectively. CR and CRi rates were 67% with venetoclax-azacitidine and 15% with placebo-azacitidine. Most common any-grade adverse events were febrile neutropenia (79 and 39%), thrombocytopenia (54 and 77%), constipation (54 and 54%) and decreased appetite (54 and 38%) in the venetoclax-azacitidine and placebo-azacitidine arms, respectively. Only 1 patient in the venetoclax-azacitidine arm, and no patients in the placebo-azacitidine arm, had grade 4 febrile neutropenia that led to treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: This Japanese subgroup analysis of VIALE-A demonstrates comparable safety and efficacy outcomes compared with the global study and supports venetoclax-azacitidine as first-line standard-of-care for Japanese treatment-naive patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

This study was conducted to clarify the expression and regulation patterns of lncRNAs in JAK2V617F-positive cMPNs, and to explore new potential carcinogenic factors of cMPNs. Bioinformatics analysis of microarray detection and wet testing verification were performed to study the expression and regulation signature of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and related genes (DEGs) in cMPNs. The expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs were observed to significantly dysregulated in JAK2V617F-positive cMPN patients compared with the normal controls. Co-expression analysis indicated that there were significant differences of the co-expression pattern of lncRNAs and mRNAs in JAK2V617F-positive cMPN patients compared to normal controls. GO and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs and DELs showed the involvement of several pathways previously reported to regulate the pathogenesis of leukemia and cMPNs. Cis- and trans-regulation analysis of lncRNAs showed that ZNF141, DHX29, NOC2L, MAS1L, AFAP1L1, and CPN2 were significantly cis-regulated by lncRNA ENST00000356347, ENST00000456816, hsa-mir-449c, NR_026874, TCONS_00012136, uc003lqp.2, and ENST00000456816, respectively, and DELs were mostly correlated with transcription factors including CTBP2, SUZ12, REST, STAT2, and GATA4 to jointly regulate multiple target genes. In summary, expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were significantly altered in JAK2V617F-positive cMPNs, the relative signaling pathway, co-expression, cis- and trans-regulation were regulated by dysregulation of lncRNAs and several important genes, such as ITGB3, which may act as a promising carcinogenic factor, warrant further investigation.",,"['Zhou, Jie', 'Wu, Hao', 'Guo, Cheng', 'Li, Bing', 'Zhou, Li-Li', 'Liang, Ai-Bin', 'Fu, Jian-Fei']","['Zhou J', 'Wu H', 'Guo C', 'Li B', 'Zhou LL', 'Liang AB', 'Fu JF']","['Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*ITGB3', '*JAK2V617F-positive', '*LncRNA', '*mRNA', '*microarray analysis']",2021/11/06 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/11/05 12:11'],"['2021/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/05 12:11 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.2000226 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(2):10564-10586. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.2000226.,12,2,10564-10586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Transcriptome data from 163 cases in the GSE12417-GPL96 dataset and 104 CN-AML patient cases in the GSE71014-GPL10558 dataset were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for overall survival (OS) analysis and validation. Results: The combination of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and cluster of diffraction 58 (CD58) can predict the prognosis of CN-AML patients. High expression of WT1 and low expression of CD58 were associated with poor OS in CN-AML. Notably, when WT1 and CD58 were used to concurrently predict OS, CN-AML patients were divided into three groups: low risk, WT1(low) CD58(high); intermediate risk, WT1(high)CD58(high) or WT1(low)CD58(low); and high risk, WT1(high) CD58(low). Compared with low-risk patients, intermediate- and high-risk patients had shorter survival time and worse OS. Furthermore, a nomogram model constructed with WT1 and CD58 may personalize and reveal the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS rate of CN-AML patients. Both time-dependent receiver operating characteristics and calibration curves suggested that the nomogram model demonstrated good performance. Conclusion: Higher expression of WT1 with lower CD58 expression may be a potential biomarker for risk stratification of CN-AML patients. Moreover, a nomogram model constructed with WT1 and CD58 may personalize and reveal the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS rates of CN-AML patients.",,"['Chen, Cunte', 'Chen, Zhuowen', 'Chio, Chi Leong', 'Zhao, Ying', 'Li, Yongsheng', 'Liu, Zhipeng', 'Jin, Zhenyi', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Wei, Wei', 'Zhao, Qi', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Chen C', 'Chen Z', 'Chio CL', 'Zhao Y', 'Li Y', 'Liu Z', 'Jin Z', 'Wu X', 'Wei W', 'Zhao Q', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, 47885Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', ""66278The First People's Hospital of Foshan City, Foshan, China."", 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, 47885Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', ""66278The First People's Hospital of Foshan City, Foshan, China."", 'Guangdong Cord Blood Bank, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municipality Tianhe Nuoya Bio-engineering Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Cord Blood Bank, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municipality Tianhe Nuoya Bio-engineering Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, 47885Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, 47885Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Cord Blood Bank, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municipality Tianhe Nuoya Bio-engineering Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Cancer Centre, 59193University of Macau, Taipa, Macau SPR, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, 47885Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD58', '*CN-AML', '*WT1', '*biomarker', '*risk stratification']",2021/11/06 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/11/05 12:10'],"['2021/11/05 12:10 [entrez]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/15330338211052152 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jan-Dec;20:15330338211052152. doi: 10.1177/15330338211052152.,20,,15330338211052152,,,PMC8573474,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0974-4036'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gain-of-function genetic alterations involving CD28 have been frequently observed in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). These abnormalities, such as CD28 fusions and copy number variations, may not only confer continuous, prolonged, and enhanced CD28 signaling to downstream pathways but also induce overexpression of the CD28 protein. In this study, 120 ATLL cases were examined by immunohistochemistry for CD28 and its ligands CD80 and CD86, and their expression on tumor cells was semiquantitatively evaluated. CD28 was overexpressed in 55 (46%) cases, and CD80 or CD86 (CD80/CD86) was infrequently overexpressed in 12 (11%). Compared with non-overexpressers, CD28 overexpressers showed a higher frequency of CD28 genetic alterations and had an increased number of CD80/CD86-positive non-neoplastic cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment. In the entire ATLL patient cohort, CD28 overexpressers showed a significantly poorer overall survival (OS) compared with non-overexpressers (P = .001). The same was true for a subgroup who were treated with multidrug regimens with or without mogamulizumab. CD28 overexpression had no prognostic impact in the group who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the multivariate analysis for OS, CD28 overexpression was selected as an independent risk factor. These results suggest ATLL patients with CD28 overexpression have more aggressive clinical course and are more refractory to treatment with multidrug chemotherapy. CD28 overexpression appears to be a novel unfavorable prognostic marker in ATLL patients, and further prospective studies are warranted to establish its prognostic significance.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: A convenience sample of 17 patients after allo-HSCT (HSCT-12 male, age 15.7+/-6.7 years, time after HSCT 5.3+/-2.8 years) underwent pulmonary function testing, echocardiography, and an incremental exercise test on a bike. Physical activity and health-related quality of life were assessed by questionnaires (7-day physical activity recall, PEDS-QL). Seventeen healthy age- and gender-matched controls served as control group (CG) for results of pulmonary function and exercise testing. RESULTS: HSCT showed reduced pulmonary function (HSCT vs. CG: FEV1 90.5+/-14.0 vs. 108.0+/-8.7%pred; FVC 88.4+/-19.3 vs. 107.6+/-6.9%pred, DLCO 75.3+/-23.6 vs. 104.9+/-12.8%pred) and exercise capacity (VO2peak 89+/-30.8%pred, CG 98+/-17.5%pred; Wmax 84+/-21.7%pred, CG 115+/-22.8%pred), but no relevant cardiac dysfunction and a good quality of life (PEDS-QL mean overall score 83.3+/-10.7). Differences in peak oxygen uptake between groups were mostly explained by 5 adolescent patients who underwent total body irradiation for conditioning. They showed significantly reduced diffusion capacity and reduced peak oxygen uptake. Patients reported a mean time of inactivity of 777+/-159min/day, moderate activity of 110+/-107 min/day, hard activity of 35+/-36 min/day, and very hard activity of 23+/-22 min/day. A higher amount of inactivity was associated with a lower peak oxygen uptake (correlation coefficient tau -0.48, p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that although patients after allo-HSCT reported a good quality of life, regular physical activity and exercise capacity are reduced in survivors of stem cell transplantation, especially in adolescents who are treated with total body irradiation for conditioning. Factors hindering regular physical activity need to be identified and exercise counseling should be part of follow-up visits in these patients.",['(c) 2021.

Cytarabine is an essential component in the Nordic mantle cell lymphoma protocols (MCL2 and MCL3) for induction and high-dose chemotherapy treatment before autologous stem cell transplantation for younger patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We here investigated the expression of SAMHD1 in a population-based cohort of MCL (N = 150). SAMHD1 was highly variably expressed in MCL (range, 0.4% to 100% of positive tumor cells). Cases with blastoid/pleomorphic morphology had higher SAMHD1 expression (P = 0.028) and SAMHD1 was also correlated to tumor cell proliferation (P = 0.016). SAMHD1 expression showed moderate correlation to the expression of the transcriptional regulator SOX11 (P = 0.036) but genetic silencing of SOX11 and SAMHD1 by siRNA in MCL cell lines did not suggest mutual regulation. We hypothesized that expression of SAMHD1 could predict short time to progression in patients treated with Cytarabine as part of high-dose chemotherapy. Despite the correlation with known biological adverse prognostic factors, neither low or high SAMHD1 expression correlated to PFS or OS in patients treated according to the Nordic MCL2 or MCL3 protocols (N = 158).",['(c) 2021.

DLEU1 (deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1), as an effective lncRNA located on chromosome 14.3q 13, modulates the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling pathway. This gene usually plays an oncogenic role in the tumorigenesis of multiple types of cancer. The present study examined the expression level of DLEU1 and its association with clinical-pathological characteristics in GC. METHODS: Total RNA of 100 specimens was extracted by TRIzol reagent. After cDNA synthesis, qRT-PCR analysis was performed to measure the expression level of the DLEU1 gene and the obtained data were analyzed by SPSS 16.0. RESULTS: The relative expression level of DLEU1 significantly increased in tumor specimens compared to the normal tumor margin specimens. The biomarker index of lncRNA DLEU1 was 0.7 in tumor tissues. The observed high expression level of DLEU1 was pertinent to the pathological progressive TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, differentiation degree, patient's age and lifestyle, and Helicobacter pylori infection in GC patients.

In this study, we evaluated a large cohort of patients and public datasets to determine the influence of sex on clinical outcomes, mutational status, and activation of immune pathways in different types of cancer. Methods: A cohort of 13,619 Oncosalud-affiliated patients bearing sex-unrelated cancers was followed over a 20-year period. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death were estimated for female vs. male patients for each cancer type and then pooled in a meta-analysis to obtain an overall HR. In addition, the mutational status of the main actionable genes in melanoma (MEL), colorectal cancer (CRC), and lung cancer was compared between sexes. Finally, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of publicly available data was conducted, to assess differences in immune processes between sexes in MEL, gastric adenocarcinoma (GC), head and neck cancer (HNC), colon cancer (CC), liver cancer (LC), pancreatic cancer (PC), thyroid cancer (TC), and clear renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). Results: Overall, women had a decreased risk of death (HR = 0.73, CI95: 8%-42%), with improved overall survival (OS) in HNC, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, MEL, multiple myeloma (MM), and non-melanoma skin cancer. Regarding the analysis of actionable mutations, only differences in EGFR alterations were observed (27.7% for men vs. 34.4% for women, p = 0.035). The number of differentially activated immune processes was higher in women with HNC, LC, CC, GC, MEL, PC, and TC and included cellular processes, responses to different stimuli, immune system development, immune response activation, multiorganism processes, and localization of immune cells. Only in CCRCC was a higher activation of immune pathways observed in men. Conclusions: The study shows an improved survival rate, increased activation of immune system pathways, and an enrichment of EGFR alterations in female patients of our cohort. Enhancement of the immune response in female cancer patients is a phenomenon that should be further explored to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Araujo, Rosas, Belmar-Lopez, Raez, Rolfo, Schwarz,', 'Infante-Huaytalla, Paez, Garcia, Alvarado, Ramos, Delgado-Espinoza,', 'Cardenas-Farfan, Cornejo, Zanabria, Colonio-Cossio, Rojas-Jefferson and Pinto.']","['Araujo, Jhajaira M', 'Rosas, Gina', 'Belmar-Lopez, Carolina', 'Raez, Luis E', 'Rolfo, Christian D', 'Schwarz, Luis J', 'Infante-Huaytalla, Ulises', 'Paez, Kevin J', 'Garcia, Luis R', 'Alvarado, Hober', 'Ramos, Fany P', 'Delgado-Espinoza, Sheyla S', 'Cardenas-Farfan, Jhon B', 'Cornejo, Melanie', 'Zanabria, Daniel', 'Colonio-Cossio, Christian', 'Rojas-Jefferson, Mario', 'Pinto, Joseph A']","['Araujo JM', 'Rosas G', 'Belmar-Lopez C', 'Raez LE', 'Rolfo CD', 'Schwarz LJ', 'Infante-Huaytalla U', 'Paez KJ', 'Garcia LR', 'Alvarado H', 'Ramos FP', 'Delgado-Espinoza SS', 'Cardenas-Farfan JB', 'Cornejo M', 'Zanabria D', 'Colonio-Cossio C', 'Rojas-Jefferson M', 'Pinto JA']","['Centro de Investigacion Basica y Traslacional, AUNA Ideas, Lima, Peru.', 'Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana, Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, Lima, Peru.', 'Departamento de Patologia, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas, Lima, Peru.', 'Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana, Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, Lima, Peru.', 'Departamento de Genomica, Oncogenomics, Lima, Peru.', 'Memorial Cancer Institute/Memorial Health Care System, Florida International University (FIU), Pembroke Pines, FL, United States.', 'Center for Thoracic Oncology/Tisch Cancer Institute, Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', 'Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana-Filial Ica, Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, Ica, Peru.', 'Centro de Investigacion Basica y Traslacional, AUNA Ideas, Lima, Peru.', 'Departamento de Patologia, AUNA, Lima, Peru.', 'Division de Riesgos, Oncosalud-AUNA, Lima, Peru.', 'Division de Riesgos, Oncosalud-AUNA, Lima, Peru.', 'Centro de Investigacion Basica y Traslacional, AUNA Ideas, Lima, Peru.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211019,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['GSEA', 'actionable mutations', 'immune gene sets', 'sex', 'survival']",2021/11/06 06:00,2021/11/06 06:01,['2021/11/05 06:51'],"['2021/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/05 06:51 [entrez]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.752918 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 19;11:752918. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.752918. eCollection 2021.,11,,752918,,,PMC8562721,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the reported exciting clinical results, the CAR-T cell approach needs efforts to improve the safety profile, limiting the occurrence of adverse events in patients given this treatment. Besides the most common side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome, another potential issue involves the inadvertent transduction of leukemia B cells with the CAR construct during the manufacturing process, thus leading to the possibility of a peculiar mechanism of antigen masking and treatment resistance. In this study, we investigated whether the inclusion of the inducible caspase 9 (iC9) suicide gene in the CAR construct design could be an effective safety switch to control malignant CAR+ B cells, ultimately counteracting this serious adverse event. iC9 is a suicide gene able to be activated through binding with an otherwise inert small biomolecule, known as AP1903. The exposure of iC9.CAR.CD19-DAUDI lymphoma and iC9.CAR.CD19-NALM-6 leukemia cells in vitro to 20 nM of AP1903 resulted into the prompt elimination of CAR(+) B-leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. The results obtained in the animal model corroborate in vitro data, since iC9.CAR.CD19(+) tumor cells were controlled in vivo by the activation of the suicide gene through administration of AP1903. Altogether, our data indicate that the inclusion of the iC9 suicide gene may result in a safe CAR-T cell product, even when manufacturing starts from biological materials characterized by heavy leukemia blast contamination.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Guercio, Manni, Boffa, Caruso, Di Cecca, Sinibaldi,', 'Abbaszadeh, Camera, Ciccone, Polito, Ferrandino, Reddel, Catanoso, Bocceri, Del', 'Bufalo,

Normal and malignant lymphopoiesis are highly dependent on the BM microenvironment, particularly on CXCL12-abundant Reticular (CAR) cells, which provide a niche for maintenance of primitive cells. During B-ALL, leukemic cells hijack BM niches, creating a proinflammatory milieu incompetent to support normal hematopoiesis but favoring leukemic proliferation. Although the lack of a phenotypic stem cell hierarchy is apparent in B-ALL, LICs are a rare and quiescent population potentially responsible for chemoresistance and relapse. Here, we developed novel patient-derived leukemia spheroids (PDLS), an ex vivo avatar model, from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and primary B-ALL cells, to mimic specialized niche structures and cell-to-cell intercommunication promoting normal and malignant hematopoiesis in pediatric B-ALL. 3D MSC spheroids can recapitulate CAR niche-like hypoxic structures that produce high levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11. We found that PDLS were preferentially enriched with leukemia cells displaying functional properties of LICs, such as quiescence, low reactive oxygen species, drug resistance, high engraftment in immunodeficient mice, and long-term leukemogenesis. Moreover, the combination of PDLS and patient-derived xenografts confirmed a microenvironment-driven hierarchy in their leukemic potential. Importantly, transcriptional profiles of MSC derived from primary patient samples revealed two unique signatures (1), a CXCL12(low) inflammatory and leukemia expansion (ILE)-like niche, that likely supports leukemic burden, and (2) a CXCL11(hi) immune-suppressive and leukemia-initiating cell (SLIC)-like niche, where LICs are likely sustained. Interestingly, the CXCL11(+) hypoxic zones were recapitulated within the PDLS that are capable of supporting LIC functions. Taken together, we have implemented a novel PDLS system that enriches and supports leukemia cells with stem cell features driven by CXCL11(+) MSCs within hypoxic microenvironments capable of recapitulating key features, such as tumor reemergence after exposure to chemotherapy and tumor initiation. This system represents a unique opportunity for designing ex vivo personalized avatars for B-ALL patients to evaluate their own LIC pathobiology and drug sensitivity in the context of the tumor microenvironment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Balandran, Davila-Velderrain, Sandoval-Cabrera,', 'Zamora-Herrera, Teran-Cerqueda, Garcia-Stivalet, Limon-Flores, Armenta-Castro,', 'Rodriguez-Martinez,

However, their functions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain unknown. In this study, we investigated how LINC00265 and miR-4500 regulate the malignant characteristics of ALL. Methods: Real-time PCR was used in examining the expression of LINC00265 in ALL cell lines and blood of patients with ALL. Cell proliferation, cell migration, and xenograft tumor assays were performed to verify the function of LINC00265 subjected to overexpressing and silencing experiments. The ceRNA mechanism with LINC00265/miR-4500/STAT3 was investigated through luciferase and RNA pull-down assays. Finally, the function of the LINC00265/miR-4500/STAT3 axis subjected to overexpressing and silencing assays was determined through cell proliferation, cell migration, and xenograft tumor assays. Results: LINC00265 was highly expressed in ALL cell lines and blood of patients with ALL and facilitated the proliferation, migration, invasion, and growth of xenograft tumors of ALL cells. The silencing of LINC00265 expression with LINC00265 siRNA significantly inhibited the malignancy of the ALL cells. RNA pull-down and luciferase assays demonstrated that LINC00265 competitively targeted miR-4500 and enhanced STAT3 expression. Furthermore, miR-4500 inhibitors or overexpressed LINC00265 up-regulated STAT3 expression, and miR-4500 mimics or STAT3 shRNAs eliminated the LINC00265-induced malignancy of the ALL cells. Conclusion: Mechanistically, LncRNA LINC00265 can competitively interact with miR-4500 and thereby up-regulates STAT3 signaling and enhances the malignancy of tumors.",['(c) 2021 Zhao et al.'],"['Zhao, Donglu', 'Xing, Qi', 'Song, Hang', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Guo, Guiying']","['Zhao D', 'Xing Q', 'Song H', 'Zhao Y', 'Guo G']","[""No. 4 Ward of Hematology Department, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Harbin First Hospital, Harbin 150010, Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""No. 4 Ward of Hematology Department, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Harbin First Hospital, Harbin 150010, Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""No. 4 Ward of Hematology Department, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Harbin First Hospital, Harbin 150010, Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""No. 4 Ward of Hematology Department, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Harbin First Hospital, Harbin 150010, Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""No. 4 Ward of Hematology Department, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Harbin First Hospital, Harbin 150010, Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211028,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['LINC00265', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cell proliferation', 'miR-4500']",2021/11/06 06:00,2021/11/06 06:01,['2021/11/05 06:46'],"['2020/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/05 06:46 [entrez]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S274590 [doi]', '274590 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Oct 28;13:8147-8156. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S274590. eCollection 2021.,13,,8147-8156,,,PMC8560060,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest for this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These and other findings have prompted diverse strategies for targeting mTOR signaling in B-ALL and other B-cell malignancies. In cellular models of Philadelphia Chromosome-positive (Ph+) B-ALL, mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs) that inhibit both mTOR-complex-1 (mTORC1) and mTOR-complex-2 (mTORC2) enhance the cytotoxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib. However, TOR-KIs have not shown substantial efficacy at tolerated doses in blood cancer clinical trials. Selective inhibition of mTORC1 or downstream effectors provides alternative strategies that may improve selectivity towards leukemia cells. Of particular interest is the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex that mediates cap-dependent translation. Here we use novel chemical and genetic approaches to show that selective targeting of either mTORC1 kinase activity or components of the eIF4F complex sensitizes murine BCR-ABL-dependent pre-B leukemia cells to dasatinib. SBI-756, a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4F assembly, sensitizes human Ph+ and Ph-like B-ALL cells to dasatinib cytotoxicity without affecting survival of T lymphocytes or natural killer cells. These findings support the further evaluation of eIF4F-targeted molecules in combination therapies with TKIs in B-ALL and other blood cancers.",['(c) 2021.

However, the association between coffee-drinking habits and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between coffee intake and NHL incidence in a large prospective study of postmenopausal US women. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: The participants included 74,935 women from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study who were recruited from 1993 through 1998. Information about coffee-drinking habits was collected at baseline via self-administered questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Newly diagnosed NHL was validated by medical records and pathology records. Separate analyses were performed for the following three subtypes of NHL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 244), follicular lymphoma (n = 166), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 64). STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations of coffee intake (specifically, the total amount of coffee consumed daily, coffee types, and coffee preparation methods) with risk of NHL. RESULTS: A total of 851 women developed NHL during a median 18.34 years of follow-up (range = 0.01 to 24.30 years; +/- 6.63 years). Overall, no associations were observed between coffee intake and risk of NHL regardless of the total amount of daily coffee intake (P value for trend = 0.90), caffeinated (P = 0.55) or decaffeinated coffee intake (P = 0.78), and filtered or unfiltered coffee intake (P = 0.91) after controlling for sociodemographic factors, lifestyle risk factors, and clinical risk factors/current medical conditions. No significant associations were observed between coffee intake with specific subtypes of NHL. A statistically significant interaction was found between alcohol intake, coffee intake, and incident NHL (P value for interaction = 0.02) based on the adjusted analysis. Specifically, among women who frequently consumed alcohol (> 7 drinks/week), those who had moderate coffee intake (2 to 3 c coffee/day) had a significantly reduced risk of developing NHL (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.98), compared with those who did not drink coffee. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study do not support an association between coffee consumption and NHL risk, irrespective of the total amount of daily coffee intake, coffee types, or coffee preparation methods.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

This study was designed to elucidate the role of eosinophil-fibroblast interactions in tissue remodeling during chronic airway inflammation. METHODS: Peripheral blood eosinophils or EoL-1 eosinophilic leukemia cells were cocultured with nasal polyp fibroblasts (NPFs). Coculture-induced release of exosomes, major components of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and a profibrotic cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Eosinophil-NPF interactions stimulated the release of exosomes and VEGF into culture supernatants. Coculture-induced release of exosomes was stimulated earlier than VEGF release, at 3 h of incubation. The average size of the EVs released by NPFs was 133 +/- 3.6 nm. NPF-derived EVs (exosome concentration: 25 pg/mL) significantly stimulated VEGF release from EoL-1 cells. Pretreatment of NPFs with exosome inhibitor, GW4869 or DMA attenuated the release of exosomes and VEGF from cocultured EoL-1 cells and NPFs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that eosinophil-fibroblast interactions are important in the pathophysiology of tissue remodeling in eosinophil-predominant airway inflammation and that NPF-derived exosomes play a crucial role in the release of VEGF.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, multiple oncogenic pathways converge on induction of telomere attrition or telomerase overexpression and these events can by themselves trigger malignant transformation. Activation of NFkappaB, the outcome of telomere complex damage, is present in leukemia stem cells but absent in normal stem cells and can activate DOT1L which has been linked to MLL-fusion leukemias. Tumors that arise from cells of early and late developmental stages appear to follow two different oncogenic routes in which the role of telomere and telomerase signaling might be differentially involved. In contrast, direct malignant transformation of stem cells appears to be extremely rare. This suggests an inherent resistance of stem cells to cancer transformation which could be linked to a stem cell'specific mechanism of telomere maintenance.

The antiproliferative activity of the studied compounds was evaluated against the human leukaemia cell line U-937. The structure-activity relationship of these naphthylchalcones was investigated by the introduction of one methoxy or two methyl groups on the A ring, the introduction of a methoxy group on the naphthyl ring or by varying the position of the methoxy group on the A ring. The results revealed that the naphthylchalcone containing a methoxy group in position 6 of the A ring was the most cytotoxic compound, with an IC50 value of 4.7 +/- 0.5 muM against U-937 cells. This synthetic chalcone induced S and G2-M cell cycle arrest, a time-dependent increase in sub-G1 ratio and annexin-V positive cells, caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Apoptosis induction was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor and by the selective caspase-3/7 inhibitor and attenuated by the inhibition of c-jun N-terminal kinases / stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

We describe the severity and outcomes of SARS-COV-2 in these patients and identify factors associated with severe disease. METHODS: This was a multinational, observational study of children (aged <19 years) with cancer or HSCT and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical (>/=1 organ support). Exact polytomous regression was used to determine the relationship between clinical variables and disease severity. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one patients with COVID-19 across 10 countries were identified (median age 8 years). Seventy-eight (60%) had leukaemia/lymphoma, 48 (37%) had solid tumour and five had primary immunodeficiency and HSCT. Fever (71%), cough (47%) and coryza (29%) were the most frequent symptoms. The median duration of detectable virus was 16 days (range, 1-79 days). Forty-nine patients (37%) were hospitalised for COVID-19 symptoms, and 15 (11%) required intensive care unit-level care. Chemotherapy was delayed/modified in 35% of patients. COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 32% of patients, mild in 47%, moderate in 8%, severe in 4% and critical in 9%. In 124 patients (95%), a full recovery was documented, and four (3%) died due to COVID-19. Any comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-5.21), any coinfection (1.74; 95% CI 1.03-3.03) and severe baseline neutropenia (1.82; 95% CI 1.13-3.09) were independently and significantly associated with increasing disease severity. CONCLUSION: Although most children with cancer had asymptomatic/mild disease, 13% had severe COVID-19 and 3% died. Comorbidity, coinfection and neutropenia may increase the risk of severe disease.

Previous research has showed that uvangoletin could induce leukemia cell death. However, the anticancer effect of uvangoletin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clarified. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effects of uvangoletin on HCC and to explore its underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured the anticancer activities of uvangoletin both in vitro and in vivo by MTT assay and HepG2 xenograft model. The effects of uvangoletin on apoptosis, autophagy, migration and invasion were also determined. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry method. Autophagy was assessed by immunofluorescence assay. Cell migration and invasion ability were validated by wound healing assay and cultrex(R) 96 well cell migration/invasion assay. The expression level of relevant proteins and pathways were examined by western blot. RESULTS: The results of MTT assay and HepG2 xenograft model showed that uvangoletin could inhibit HCC cells proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Uvangoletin could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis as evidence by the increased expression of cleaved caspase 3, caspase 8 and Bax while decreased Bcl-2 expression. Wound healing assay and transwell assay showed that uvangoletin inhibited HepG2 cells migration and invasion and reduced vimentin, MMP9, MMP2 expression. Uvangoletin also promoted autophagy in HepG2 cells as confirmed by the accumulation of GFP-LC3 puncta. Autophagy inhibitors like 3-MA or CQ could suppress uvangoletin-induced apoptosis. Importantly, uvangoletin-induced anti-EMT effect was also attenuated after autophagy inhibitors added in. Mechanistically, the expressions of p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, p-AKT, p-p70S6k and p-mTOR were significantly decreased after uvangoletin treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that uvangoletin could induce apoptotic and autophagic cell death, inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis on HepG2 cells through Akt/mTOR, MAPK and TGFbeta/Smad2 signal pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

AIM: Several studies have assessed the relationship between ATM mutations and the clinical prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, its prognostic value has not yet been fully clarified. Hence, we aimed this meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic effect of ATM mutations in patients with CLL. METHOD: The selected clinical studies were extracted from various electronic databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. In our meta-analysis, Hazard Ratio (HRs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) were chosen to estimate the prognostic impact of ATM mutations and to compare ATM mutations to those with wild-type. RESULTS: A total of 1299 patients from seven studies were collected. The pooled HRs for OS recommended that patients with CLL had a poorer prognosis HR = 1.24 (95 % CI: 0.97-1.59). The incidence of ATM mutations was found 15.8 % in patients with CLL. Begg's and Egger's tests did not show any significant bias between studies. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that ATM mutations were significantly associated with adverse prognostic effect in patients with CLL. However, a randomized controlled prospective study with a large number of patients with different types of ATM mutations is required to assert these results.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim was to model and determine the margin of tolerance, if any, required to ensure treatment responses among patients prescribed imatinib before treatment response is at risk. METHOD: We performed post hoc analyses of the ADAGIO study conducted in Belgium on 169 evaluable patients (Blood 2009). Applying Kaplan-Meier methods using adherence instead of the conventional time variable, we modeled the likelihood of complete cytogenetic (CCyR), complete hematological (CHR), major molecular (MMR) and optimal (OR) response as a function of 90-day pill count adherence. RESULTS: Analyses showed that approximately 100 % adherence of prescribed dose is associated with probabilities of 0.84 for CHR, 0.83 for CCyR, 0.82 for OR, and 0.77 for MMR; compared to, 0.37 (CHR and CCyR), 0.35 (OR), and 0.39 (MMR) at 90 % adherence. Increasing intake of imatinib from 90 % to 100 % of the prescribed dose increased the likelihood of the various treatment responses by 1.95-2.35-fold.

We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of LUNAR1 in pediatric T-ALL, in addition, to find out its association with NOTCH1 and IGF-1R. The LUNAR1, NOTCH1, and IGF-IR gene expression were measured in peripheral blood (PB) samples of l85 children with T-ALL and forty non-leukemic samples as a control group.

We analysed data from the Richter transformation cohort of a larger, ongoing, phase 1-2, single-arm study evaluating the safety and activity of the selective, irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor acalabrutinib for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS: For this open-label, single-arm, phase 1-2 study, patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-proven treatment-naive or previously treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation) or prolymphocytic leukaemia transformation (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status </=2) were assigned to receive oral acalabrutinib 200 mg twice daily as monotherapy until disease progression or toxicity. Patients were enrolled across seven centres from four countries. Safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed as primary endpoints; secondary endpoints were overall response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival. Safety was assessed in the all-treated population (patients who received >/=1 dose), and activity was assessed in the all-treated population (for progression-free survival) and efficacy-evaluable population (for response rate; patients in the all-treated population with >/=1 response assessment after the first dose). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02029443). FINDINGS: Between Sept 2, 2014, and April 25, 2016, 25 patients with Richter transformation were enrolled; 12 (48%) were male and 23 (92%) were White. As of data cutoff (March 1, 2021), two (8%) of 25 patients remained on acalabrutinib. The median time on study was 2.6 months (IQR 1.8-8.4). The most common adverse events (all grades) were diarrhoea (12 [48%] of 25 patients), headache (11 [44%]), and anaemia (eight [32%]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (seven [28%] of 25) and anaemia (five [20%]). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression (17 [68%] of 25 patients). 11 (44%) deaths were reported within 30 days of the last acalabrutinib dose; none was considered treatment-related. Acalabrutinib was rapidly absorbed and eliminated, with similar day 1 and day 8 exposures. The overall response rate was 40.0% (95% CI 21.1-61.3), with two (8%) of 25 patients having a complete response and eight (32%) having a partial response; the median duration of response was 6.2 months (95% CI 0.3-14.8). Median progression-free survival in the overall cohort was 3.2 months (95% CI 1.8-4.0). INTERPRETATION: Acalabrutinib appears to be generally well tolerated, although progression-free survival was relatively poor in this cohort of patients with Richter transformation. On the basis of these findings, the use of acalabrutinib monotherapy in this setting is limited; however, further assessment of acalabrutinib as part of combination-based regimens for patients with Richter transformation is warranted.

RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric, adolescent, and young adult oncology patients, including those with ALL, are living longer with higher overall survival rates as treatments and supportive care for these patients continue to improve. These patients are burdened by the risk of significant health and quality of life consequences as a result of their treatment.. For these patients, the late effects of treatment can be life-threatening, such as secondary cancers or cardiotoxicity, or life-altering with respect to quality of life. The goal of this paper is to review the current literature, research, and surveillance guidelines regarding the late effects of ALL therapy, to outline what can be done to mitigate the toxic effects of oncology treatment, and to extend life expectancy and improve quality of life for our patients. We review risk factors and interventions available to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease, secondary malignancies, endocrine complications (obesity, osteoporosis, infertility, and premature menopause), cognitive effects, and effects on functioning and mortality.","['(c) 2021.

Prognosis of ATL remains dismal. Herein, we emphasized on the current ATL treatment modalities and their drawbacks, and opened up on promising targeted therapies with special focus on the HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and HBZ. RECENT FINDINGS: Indolent ATL and a fraction of acute ATL exhibit long-term survival following antiviral treatment with zidovudine and interferon-alpha. Monoclonal antibodies such as mogamulizumab improved response rates, but with little effect on survival. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation results in long-term survival in one third of transplanted patients, alas only few patients are transplanted. Salvage therapy with lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory patients leads to prolonged survival in some of them. ATL remains an unmet medical need. Targeted therapies focusing on the HTLV-1 viral replication and/or viral regulatory proteins, as well as on the host antiviral immunity, represent a promising approach for the treatment of ATL.","['(c) 2021.

We aimed to examine associations between HRV and psychosocial outcomes in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial testing a resilience intervention in AYAs with cancer. Two widely used HRV metrics, the standard deviation of normal to normal beats (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were derived from electrocardiograms. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) survey measures included quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and resilience. Linear regression models were used to test associations between HRV and PRO scores. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test differences in median HRV values among participant subgroups. RESULTS: Among the n = 76 patients with available electrocardiograms, the mean age was 16 years (SD 3y), 63% were white, and leukemia/lymphoma was the most common diagnosis. Compared to healthy adolescents, AYAs with cancer had lower median HRV (SDNN [Females: 31.9 (12.8-50.7) vs 66.4 (46.0-86.8), p<0.01; Males: 29.9 (11.5-47.9) vs 63.2 (48.4-84.6), p<0.01]; RMSSD [Females: 28.2 (11.1-45.5) vs 69.0 (49.1-99.6), p<0.01; Males: 27.9 (8.6-48.6) vs 58.7 (44.8-88.2), p<0.01]). There was no statistically significant association between PRO measures and SDNN or RMSSD in either an unadjusted or adjusted linear regression models. CONCLUSION: In this secondary analysis, we did not find an association between HRV and psychosocial PROs among AYAs with cancer. HRV measures were lower than for healthy adolescents.

Endothelial cells are the core regulator of CRS in many infectious diseases and may also play a key role after CAR-T cell therapy. We provided a detailed clinical, laboratory description and endothelial cell activation biomarkers in patients with CRS. Endothelial cell activation was associated with occurrence, development and severity of CRS, manifested by decreased serum angiopoietin (Ang)-1 levels and increased levels of von Willebrand Factor (VWF), Ang-2, Ang-2:Ang-1, sE-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1. Besides, the endothelial activation was correlated with the hepatic, kidney and hematopoietic dysfunction in CRS patients. After infusion of CAR-T cells, we detected changes of endothelial activation-related biomarkers within 36 hours in patients who subsequently developed CRS, especially severe CRS. Using top tree models, we could predict which patients would develop CRS, especially severe CRS, or identify the severity of CRS by certain biomarkers of endothelial activation. These data provide a new idea and will help identify new targets for early intervention and prevention of CRS.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum), a modified stem and an important food crop, serves as a substantial portion of the world's subsistence food supply. In the past two decades, crucial molecular signals have been identified that govern the tuberization (potato development) mechanism. Interestingly, microRNA156 overexpression in potato provided the first evidence for induction of profuse aerial stolons and tubers from axillary meristems under short-day (SD) photoperiod. A similar phenotype was noticed for overexpression of epigenetic modifiers-MUTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1 (StMSI1) or ENAHNCER OF ZESTE 2 (StE[z]2), and knockdown of B-CELL-SPECIFIC MOLONEY MURINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS INTEGRATION SITE 1 (StBMI1). This striking phenotype represents a classic example of modulation of plant architecture and developmental plasticity. Differentiation of a stolon to a tuber or a shoot under in vitro or in vivo conditions symbolizes another example of organ-level plasticity and dual fate acquisition in potato. Stolon-to-tuber transition is governed by SD photoperiod, mobile RNAs/proteins, phytohormones, a plethora of small RNAs and their targets. Recent studies show that polycomb group proteins control microRNA156, phytohormone metabolism/transport/signaling and key tuberization genes through histone modifications to govern tuber development. Our comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes between the overexpression lines of StMSI1, StBEL5 (BEL1-LIKE transcription factor [TF]), and POTATO HOMEOBOX 15 TF revealed more than 1,000 common genes, indicative of a mutual gene regulatory network potentially involved in the formation of aerial and belowground tubers. In this review, in addition to key tuberization factors, we highlight the role of photoperiod and epigenetic mechanism that regulates the development of aerial and belowground tubers in potato.","['(c) American Society of Plant Biologists 2021.

However, evolutionary events subsequent to chemotherapy could also explain changes in clonal dominance seen at relapse. We, therefore, investigated the mechanisms of selection in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) during induction chemotherapy where maximal cytoreduction occurs. To distinguish stochastic versus deterministic events, individual leukemias were transplanted into multiple xenografts and chemotherapy administered. Analyses of the immediate post-treatment leukemic residuum at single-cell resolution revealed that chemotherapy has little impact on genetic heterogeneity. Rather, it acts on extensive, previously unappreciated, transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity in BCP-ALL, dramatically reducing the spectrum of cell states represented, leaving a genetically polyclonal but phenotypically uniform population with hallmark signatures relating to developmental stage, cell cycle and metabolism.

One such lncRNA mrhl, reported by our group, was found to have important role in spermatogenesis and embryonic development in mouse. Recently, its human homolog, Hmrhl was shown to have differential expression in several type of cancers. In the present study, we further characterize molecular features of Hmrhl and gain insight into its functional role in leukemia by gene silencing and transcriptome-based studies. Results indicate its high expression in CML patient samples as well as in K562 cell line. Silencing experiments suggest role of Hmrhl in cell proliferation, migration & invasion. RNA-seq and ChiRP-seq data analysis further revealed its association with important biological processes, including perturbed expression of crucial TFs and cancer-related genes. Among them ZIC1, PDGRFbeta and TP53 were identified as regulatory targets, with high possibility of triplex formation by Hmrhl at their promoter site. Further, overexpression of PDGRFbeta in Hmrhl silenced cells resulted in rescue effect of cancer associated cellular phenotypes. In addition, we also found TAL-1 to be a potential regulator of Hmrhl expression in K562 cells. Thus, we hypothesize that Hmrhl lncRNA may play a significant role in the pathobiology of CML.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Understanding intra-tumor heterogeneity is essential from the clinical perspective. Numerous methods have been developed to predict this phenomenon based on variant allele frequency. Among the methods, CloneSig models the variant allele frequency and mutation signatures simultaneously and provides an accurate clone decomposition. However, this method has limitations in terms of clone number selection and modeling. We propose SigTracer, a novel hierarchical Bayesian approach for analyzing intra-tumor heterogeneity based on mutation signatures to tackle these issues. We show that SigTracer predicts more reasonable clone decompositions than the existing methods against artificial data that mimic cancer genomes. We applied SigTracer to whole-genome sequences of blood cancer samples. The results were consistent with past findings that single base substitutions caused by a specific signature (previously reported as SBS9) related to the activation-induced cytidine deaminase intensively lie within immunoglobulin-coding regions for chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Furthermore, we showed that this signature mutates regions responsible for cell-cell adhesion. Accurate assignments of mutations to signatures by SigTracer can provide novel insights into signature origins and mutational processes.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The myeloproliferative disease frequently progresses to AML and lymphoid neoplasms can develop into acute lymphomas. No matter the cell type involved, or clinical presentation, chromosome translocations involving the FGFR1 kinase and various partner genes, which leads to constitutive activation of downstream oncogenic signaling cascades. These patients are not responsive to treatment regimens developed for other acute leukemias and survival is poor. Recent development of specific FGFR1 inhibitors has suggested an alternative therapeutic approach but resistance is likely to evolve over time. Mouse models of this disease syndrome have been developed and are being used for preclinical evaluation of FGFR1 inhibitors. Cell lines from these models have now been developed and have been used to investigate the mechanisms of resistance that might be expected in clinical cases. So far, a V561M mutation in the kinases domain and deletion of PTEN have been recognized as leading to resistance and both operate through the PI3K/AKT signaling axis. One of the important consequences is the suppression of PUMA, a potent enforcer of apoptosis, which operates through BCL2. Targeting BCL2 in the resistant cells leads to suppression of leukemia development in mouse models, which potentially provides an opportunity to treat patients that become resistant to FGFR1 inhibitors. In addition, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying FGFR1-driven leukemias and lymphomas also provides new targets for combined treatment as another option to bypass the FGFR1 inhibitor resistance and improve patient outcome.",,"['Cowell, John K', 'Hu, Tianxiang']","['Cowell JK', 'Hu T']","['Georgia Cancer Center, 1410 Laney Walker Blvd, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, 1410 Laney Walker Blvd, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210525,United States,Cancer Drug Resist,"Cancer drug resistance (Alhambra, Calif.)",101738710,,['NOTNLM'],"['FGFR1', 'MLN-eo FGFR1', 'PTEN', 'PUMA', 'lymphomas', 'mouse models', 'mutations']",2021/11/05 06:00,2021/11/05 06:01,['2021/11/04 06:31'],"['2021/11/04 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.20517/cdr.2021.30 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Drug Resist. 2021;4:607-619. doi: 10.20517/cdr.2021.30.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the management of AML have great value in clinical practice. However, the reporting quality of CPGs for AML has not yet been evaluated. This is the first study aiming to evaluate the reporting quality of the most recent AML CPGs published worldwide using the Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) checklist. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) to extract CPGs for AML published between January 2016 and December 2020. Websites for guideline development organizations and medical associations were also searched. Two independent researchers assessed compliance of the guidelines to each of the 35 checklist items and summarized reporting rates for the 7 domains of the RIGHT checklist. Results: We identified 16 guidelines, of which 3 (18.8%) were written in Chinese and 13 (81.3%) were written in English. The average overall reporting rate of the 16 guidelines was 52.9%, and only 7 CPGs (43.8%) had a reporting rate >50%. The average reporting rates of the 7 domains (basic information; background; evidence; recommendations; review and quality assurance; funding, declaration, and management of interests; and other information) were 79.2%, 62.5%, 38.8%, 53.6%, 21.9%, 32.8%, and 43.8%, respectively. For the 35 checklist items, the average reporting rate was 52.9%, and only 16 items had a reporting rate >50%, of which 5 items were reported by all the guidelines. There was 1 item which was not reported by any of the guidelines. Conclusions: The reporting quality of recently published AML guidelines remains poor.

Currently, the role of TME in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear. This study investigated the correlation between immune-related genes and prognosis in AML patients. Methods: Transcriptome RNA-Seq data for 151 AML samples were downloaded from TCGA database (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), and the immune related genes (irgs) were selected from Immport database. Bioinformatics screening was used to identify irgs for AML, and genes with a critical role in the prognosis of AML were selected for further analysis. To confirm the prognostic role of irgs in AML, we undertook protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of the top 30 interacting genes. We then investigated associations between immune cell infiltration and prognosis in AML patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate protein expression levels between AML and normal bone marrow samples. Analysis of the drug sensitivity of the selected gene was then performed. Results: The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (CD11A/CD18; ITGAL/ITGB2) was identified as the key immune-related gene that significantly influenced prognosis in AML patients. Overexpression of ITGB2 indicated poor prognosis in AML patients (P=0.007). Risk modeling indicated that a high-risk score led to poor outcomes (P=3.076e-08) in AML patients. The risk model showed accuracy for predicting prognosis in AML patients, with area under curve (AUC) at 1 year, 0.816; AUC at 3 years, 0.82; and AUC at 5 years, 0.875. In addition, we found that ITGB2 had a powerful influence on immune cell infiltration into AML TME. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that AML patients had significantly higher ITGB2 protein expression than normal samples. The AML patients were divided into 2 groups based on ITGB2 risk scores. Drug sensitivity test results indicated that the high-risk group was sensitive to cytarabine, axitinib, bosutinib, and docetaxel, but resistant to cisplatin and bortezomib. Conclusions: In the present study, we found that ITGB2 may be able to serve as a biomarker for assessing prognosis and drug sensitivity in AML patients.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Ferroptosis-related signatures have been shown to act as regulators of the progression of multiple cancer types, but the role of ferroptosis in AML remains to be elucidated. We performed the present study to preliminarily investigate the roles of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in AML. Methods: The transcriptome data of AML patients was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the transcriptome data of normal samples was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. FRGs were selected via public articles. Expression levels of FRGs between AML and normal samples were analyzed. The prognostic model based on FRGs was constructed via lasso regression. The expression levels and prognostic role of FRGs were identified from the risk model. We also performed validation experiments to verify the expression levels of the final selected genes via immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and RNA-seq. Finally, we explored the associations between immune infiltration, drug sensitivity, and the selected FRGs. Results: The transcriptome data of 151 AML samples were retrieved from TCGA and 70 bone marrow normal samples were retrieved from the GTEx database. Additionally, 23 FRGs were collected from the published articles. There were 22 differentially expressed FRGs, and among them, dipetidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) (P= 0.011, HR =1.504), GPX4 (P=0.055, HR =1.569), LPCAT3 (P<0.001, HR =2.243), SLC7A11 (P=0.012, HR =2.243), and transferrin receptor (TFRC) (P=0.029, 0.774) had a significant influence on the prognosis of AML patients via lasso regression. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the FRG signatures indicated that this model is novel and effective method for predicting the prognosis of AML patients. DPP4 (P<0.001) was overexpressed while LPCAT3 (P<0.001), TFRC (P<0.001), GPX4 (P<0.001), and SLC7A11 (P<0.001) were downregulated, further validation experiment results indicated that DPP4 was significantly downregulated but TFRC was upregulated in AML samples.

However, the mechanism of MSCs with CAF-like phenotype interacting with leukemia cells in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and promoting the progression of B-ALL remains unclear. Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells with CAF-like phenotype were obtained by treating MSCs with recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (rhTGF-beta), hereafter referred to as TGF-beta conditioned MSCs. In vivo mouse model experiments, in vitro transwell chamber experiments, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models, lentiviral transfection and other experimental methods were used to investigate the possible mechanism of the interaction between TGF-beta conditioned MSCs and leukemia cells in promoting the growth, migration and invasion of B-ALL cells. Results: Compared with untreated MSCs, TGF-beta conditioned MSCs significantly promoted the growth and proliferation of leukemia cells in mice, and increased the expression of CXCR4 in tumor tissues. In vitro cell experiments, TGF-beta conditioned MSCs obviously promoted the migration and invasion of Nalm-6/RS4;11 cells, which were effectively blocked by the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100, thereby inhibiting the secretion of MMP-9 in TGF-beta conditioned MSCs and inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in leukemia cells. Further, findings were made that the interaction between TGF-beta conditioned MSCs and leukemia cells were mediated by the interaction between the integrin receptor alpha5beta1 on the surface of leukemia cells and the increased expression of fibronectin on TGF-beta conditioned MSCs. AMD3100 could weaken such effect by reducing the expression of integrin alpha5beta1 on leukemia cells. Further regulation of integrin beta1 could effectively interfere with the interaction between TGF-beta conditioned MSCs and leukemia cells. Conclusion: Mesenchymal stem cells with CAF-like phenotype could be a key factor in promoting the growth and invasion of B-ALL cells, and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis might be a significant factor in mediating the communication of MSCs with CAF-like phenotype and leukemia cells. To prevent the progression of B-ALL cells, blocking the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis with AMD3100 or targeting integrin beta1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Pan, Fang, Liu, Ma, Cao, Zhang, Chen, Hu and Wang.']","['Pan, Chengyun', 'Fang, Qin', 'Liu, Ping', 'Ma, Dan', 'Cao, Shuyun', 'Zhang, Luxin', 'Chen, Qingzhen', 'Hu, Tianzhen', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Pan C', 'Fang Q', 'Liu P', 'Ma D', 'Cao S', 'Zhang L', 'Chen Q', 'Hu T', 'Wang J']","['School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer-associated fibroblast like phenotype', 'cell-cell communication', 'invasion', 'mesenchymal stem cells']",2021/11/05 06:00,2021/11/05 06:01,['2021/11/04 06:28'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/04 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.708513 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 18;9:708513. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.708513. eCollection 2021.,9,,708513,,,PMC8558501,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Single-Center Cohort Study.,10.3389/fonc.2021.701604 [doi],"The co-occurrence of myeloid neoplasms and lymphoproliferative diseases (LPDs) has been epidemiologically described, particularly in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). However, the clinical features of these patients are poorly known. In this study, we evaluated a single-center cohort of 44 patients with a diagnosis of myeloid and LPD focusing on clinical features, therapy requirement, and outcome. The two diagnoses were concomitant in 32% of patients, while myeloid disease preceded LPD in 52% of cases (after a median of 37 months, 6-318), and LPD preceded myeloid neoplasm in 16% (after a median of 41 months, 5-242). The most prevalent LPD was non-Hodgkin lymphoma (50%), particularly lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (54.5%), followed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (27%), plasma cell dyscrasias (18.2%), and rarer associations such as Hodgkin lymphoma and Erdheim-Chester disease. Overall, 80% of BCR-ABL1-negative MPN patients required a myeloid-specific treatment and LPD received therapy in 45.5% of cases. Seven subjects experienced vascular events, 13 a grade >/= 3 infectious episode (9 pneumonias, 3 urinary tract infection, and 1 sepsis), and 9 developed a solid tumor. Finally, nine patients died due to solid tumor (four), leukemic progression (two), infectious complications (two), and brain bleeding (one). Longer survival was observed in younger patients (p = 0.001), with better performance status (p = 0.02) and in the presence of driver mutations (p = 0.003). Contrarily, a worse survival was significantly associated with the occurrence of infections (p < 0.0001). These data suggest that in subjects with co-occurrence of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, high medical surveillance for infectious complications is needed, along with patient education, since they may negatively impact outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Bucelli, Fattizzo, Cattaneo, Giannotta, Barbullushi, Pasquale,', 'Barozzi, Barbanti, Pettine, Rossi, Reda, Cassin, Barcellini, Baldini and Iurlo.']","['Bucelli, Cristina', 'Fattizzo, Bruno', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Giannotta, Juri Alessandro', 'Barbullushi, Kordelia', 'Pasquale, Raffaella', 'Barozzi, Enrico', 'Barbanti, Maria Chiara', 'Pettine, Loredana', 'Rossi, Francesca Gaia', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Cassin, Ramona', 'Barcellini, Wilma', 'Baldini, Luca', 'Iurlo, Alessandra']","['Bucelli C', 'Fattizzo B', 'Cattaneo D', 'Giannotta JA', 'Barbullushi K', 'Pasquale R', 'Barozzi E', 'Barbanti MC', 'Pettine L', 'Rossi FG', 'Reda G', 'Cassin R', 'Barcellini W', 'Baldini L', 'Iurlo A']","[""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Onco-Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Onco-Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Onco-Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Onco-Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Onco-Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Onco-Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['infections', 'lymphoproliferative syndromes', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'secondary malignancies']",2021/11/05 06:00,2021/11/05 06:01,['2021/11/04 06:27'],"['2021/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/04 06:27 [entrez]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.701604 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 18;11:701604. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.701604. eCollection 2021.,11,,701604,,,PMC8558405,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel agents for patients with relapsed/refractory TCL are urgently needed. Lenalidomide is an oral drug with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic and direct antineoplastic effects. These peculiar mechanisms of action make TCL an attractive target for lenalidomide. We have identified five clinical trials in which lenalidomide monotherapy was investigated to treat TCL, including cutaneous TCL (CTCL) and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL). In the ATLL-002 study, the overall response rate (ORR) was 42% and median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 3.8 mo and 20.3 mo, respectively. In a phase II trial for CTCL, ORR was 28% and median PFS and overall survival were 8 mo and 43 mo, respectively. For nodal peripheral TCL, ORR was between 10% and 43% in three clinical trials, with a median PFS of about 4 mo, even if some patients had a durable response. Overall toxicity is manageable and grade 3-4 events are mainly hematological and reversible. Combination strategies did not improve PFS. In conclusion, lenalidomide could represent a suitable treatment option for relapsed/refractory TCL, especially for neoplasms with a T-follicular helper origin, such as angioimmunoblastic TCL.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021.

The mechanisms of TKI-induced toxicity are not fully understood and it remains challenging to predict potential cardiovascular toxicity of a compound. In this study, we established a zebrafish model to evaluate potential in vivo cardiovascular toxicity of TKIs. We treated the endothelium labeled Tg(kdrl:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish embryos with TKIs then performed confocal imaging to evaluate their vascular structure and function. We found that among FDA approved CML TKIs, ponatinib (the only approved TKI that is efficacious to T315I mutation) is the most toxic one. We then evaluated safety profiles of several clinical stage kinase inhibitors that can target T315I and found that HQP1351 treatment leads to vasculopathies similar to those induced by ponatinib while the allosteric ABL inhibitor asciminib does not induce noticeable cardiovascular defects, indicating it could be a promising therapeutic reagent for patients with T315I mutation. We then performed proof-of-principle study to rescue those TKI-induced cardiovascular toxicities and found that, among commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers such as azilsartan and valsartan are able to reduce ponatinib or HQP1351 induced cardiovascular toxicities. Together, this study establishes a zebrafish model that can be useful to evaluate cardiovascular toxicity of TKIs as well as to develop strategies to minimize TKI-induced adverse events.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Cheng, Jin, Li, Pei and Shu.']","['Cheng, Shan', 'Jin, Pan', 'Li, Heying', 'Pei, Duanqing', 'Shu, Xiaodong']","['Cheng S', 'Jin P', 'Li H', 'Pei D', 'Shu X']","['School of Life Science, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', 'Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Life Science, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', 'Centre for Regenerative Medicine and Health, Hong Kong Institute of Science and Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', 'Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'HQP1351', 'TKI', 'cardiovascular toxicity', 'ponatinib', 'zebrafish']",2021/11/05 06:00,2021/11/05 06:01,['2021/11/04 06:21'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/04 06:21 [entrez]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.740529 [doi]', '740529 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Oct 18;12:740529. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.740529. eCollection 2021.,12,,740529,,,PMC8558359,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML with FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations has an unfavorable prognosis and is highly associated with wt-p53 dysfunction. While TP53 mutation in the presence of FLT3-ITD does not induce AML in mice, it is not clear whether p53 haploinsufficiency or loss cooperates with FLT3-ITD in the induction of AML. Here, we generated FLT3-ITD knock-in; p53 knockout (heterozygous and homozygous) double-transgenic mice and found that both alterations strongly cooperated in the induction of cytogenetically normal AML without increasing the self-renewal potential. At the molecular level, we found the strong upregulation of Htra3 and the downregulation of Lin28a, leading to enhanced proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis and differentiation. The co-occurrence of Htra3 overexpression and Lin28a knockdown, in the presence of FLT3-ITD, induced AML with similar morphology as leukemic cells from double-transgenic mice. These leukemic cells were highly sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib.

The mechanisms that protect them from stress-induced death and degeneration remain elusive. Here we show that embryonic deletion of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) in auditory neurons or hair cells leads to sensorineural hearing loss due to postnatal degeneration of both cell types. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CHD7 controls the expression of major stress pathway components. In its absence, hair cells are hypersensitive, dying rapidly after brief exposure to stress inducers, suggesting that sound at the onset of hearing triggers their degeneration. In humans, CHD7 haploinsufficiency causes CHARGE syndrome, a disorder affecting multiple organs including the ear. Our findings suggest that CHD7 mutations cause developmentally silent phenotypes that predispose cells to postnatal degeneration due to a failure of protective mechanisms.",['(c) 2021.

Balanced translocations with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH; 14q32) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are infrequent but have led to the discovery of pathogenic genes including CCND1, BCL2, and BCL3. Following identification of a t(X;14)(q28;q32) translocation that placed the mature T cell proliferation 1 gene (MTCP1) adjacent to the immunoglobulin locus in a CLL patient, we hypothesized that this gene may have previously unrecognized importance. Indeed, here we report overexpression of human MTCP1 restricted to the B cell compartment in mice produces a clonal CD5(+)/CD19(+) leukemia recapitulating the major characteristics of human CLL and demonstrates favorable response to therapeutic intervention with ibrutinib. We reinforce the importance of genetic interrogation of rare, recurrent balanced translocations to identify cancer driving genes via the story of MTCP1 as a contributor to CLL pathogenesis.",['(c) 2021.

Using a mouse model harboring NRas(G12D) and EZH2 mutations that recapitulates leukemic progression, we employ single-cell transcriptomic profiling to map cellular composition and gene expression alterations in healthy or diseased bone marrows during leukemogenesis. At cellular level, NRas(G12D) induces myeloid lineage-biased differentiation and EZH2-deficiency impairs myeloid cell maturation, whereas they cooperate to promote myeloid neoplasms with dysregulated transcriptional programs. At gene level, NRas(G12D) and EZH2-deficiency independently and synergistically deregulate gene expression. We integrate results from histopathology, leukemia repopulation, and leukemia-initiating cell assays to validate transcriptome-based cellular profiles. We use this resource to relate developmental hierarchies to leukemia phenotypes, evaluate oncogenic cooperation at single-cell and single-gene levels, and identify GEM as a regulator of leukemia-initiating cells.

She then underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Although cyclosporine (CS) was stopped at 120 days after transplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) of the skin developed. She was treated with a topical steroid, without exacerbation of the GVHD. She was admitted to our hospital due to the sudden development of pancytopenia at 212 days after the transplantation. She had an EB virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in the hilum of the lung. The cGVHD of the skin resolved after the administration of prednisolone and CS. However, pancytopenia and PTLD persisted. Treatment with four cycles of rituximab (4x375 mg/m(2)/week) led to the complete resolution of PTLD, but transfusion-dependent cytopenia did not improve. Secondary engraftment failure was diagnosed, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and eltrombopag (100 mg/day) were administered, leading to gradual improvement of pancytopenia. It was observed that persistent pancytopenia was caused by secondary engraftment failure due to cGVHD in this case.

At diagnosis, the patient had an unresectable mediastinal tumor with elevated alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin levels and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We prioritized treatment with chemotherapy for the tumor owing to the oncological emergency. We then performed leukemia induction therapy and achieved complete remission. Although we used CDDP in combination with intensive therapy, the mediastinal tumor grew too large for it to be safely resected. We transplanted bone marrow from the patient's human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical sibling upon conditioning with busulfan-melphalan. After 44 days, the leukemia recurred in the patient's central nervous system. This was followed by various post-transplant complications, and the patient died of organ failure that was associated with infectious diseases. At necropsy, a poorly engrafted bone marrow was observed. The mediastinal tumor was primarily necrotic, although some immature teratoma components were observed. No leukemic precursor cells were detected. Residual mediastinal tumors may be associated with the recurrence of leukemias.

Although patients with hematological malignancy (HM) are reported to have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with those with solid cancer, the effects of treatment for HM on COVID-19 severity have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the risk factors, including number and timing of chemotherapeutic regimens for HM, for COVID-19 severity in 17 patients with HM, who had developed nosocomial COVID-19 in our department, by dividing them into two groups; a severe group (N=7) and a non-severe group (N=10). RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 47%, and mortality in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group (odds ratio [OR], 18.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1223.17, P=0.02). Univariate analysis identified two or more chemotherapeutic regimens for HM (OR, 17.34; 95%CI, 1.15-1165.33, P=0.03) and a low hemoglobin level (P=0.02) as significant risk factors for COVID-19 severity. However, a history of chemotherapy for HM within 3 months prior to the onset of COVID-19 was not a significant risk factor (P=0.54). CONCLUSION: A history of multiple chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with HM may be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity, and physicians should be aware of this.",,"['Tsukada, Nodoka', 'Inamura, Junki', 'Igarashi, Sho', 'Sato, Kazuya']","['Tsukada N', 'Inamura J', 'Igarashi S', 'Sato K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Kosei General Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Kosei General Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Kosei General Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Kosei General Hospital.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Hematological malignancy', 'Multiple chemotherapeutic regimens', 'Nosocomial infection']",2021/11/05 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/11/04 05:40'],"['2021/11/04 05:40 [entrez]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.62.1474 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2021;62(10):1474-1481. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.62.1474.,62,10,1474-1481,20211105,"['*COVID-19', '*Cross Infection', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This could be because DS-ALL has less hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 abnormalities, which have a favorable prognosis, more Ph-like ALL, which has a poor prognosis, as well as more adverse deaths due to infectious complications. It has been reported that optimizing the treatment intensity using minimal residual disease and by strengthening the measures against adverse effects improve the treatment outcome of DS-ALL. The incidence of DS-ALL is reported to be 20 times higher than that of non-DS-ALL. The mechanism is believed to be through proliferation of the lymphoid system caused by HMGN1 on chromosome 21 as well as activation of JAK-STAT and proliferation of ALL cells caused by overexpression of CRLF2, such as P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion. The CRLF2 abnormality is found in 30-60% of DS-ALL cases.

The adaptor protein p66Shc is a negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling, chemotaxis and apoptosis whose loss in CLL B cells contributes to their extended survival and poor prognosis. Hence, the identification of compounds that restore p66Shc expression and function in malignant B cells may pave the way to a new therapeutic approach for CLL. Here we show that a novel oxazepine-based compound (OBC-1) restores p66Shc expression in primary human CLL cells by promoting JNK-dependent STAT4 activation without affecting normal B cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the potent pro-apoptotic activity of OBC-1 in human leukemic cells directly correlates with p66Shc expression levels and is abrogated when p66Shc is genetically deleted. Preclinical testing of OBC-1 and the novel analogue OBC-2 in Emu-TCL1 tumor-bearing mice resulted in a significantly longer overall survival and a reduction of the tumor burden in the spleen and peritoneum. Interestingly, OBCs promote leukemic cell mobilization from the spleen to the blood, which correlates with upregulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor expression. In summary, our work identifies OBCs as a promising class of compounds that, by boosting p66Shc expression through the activation of the JNK/STAT4 pathway, display dual therapeutic effects for CLL intervention, namely the ability to mobilize cells from secondary lymphoid organs and a potent pro-apoptotic activity against circulating leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent studies, a significant improvement in event-free, relapse-free and overall survival was shown by adding gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a humanized antibody-drug conjugate directed against CD33, to intensive induction therapy once or in a sequential dosing schedule. Glasdegib, the small-molecule inhibitor of smoothened (SMO), also showed improved overall survival in patients not eligible for intensive chemotherapy when combined with low-dose cytarabine compared to low-dose cytarabine alone. These findings warrant further investigations in the phase III GnG trial. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized phase III trial with measurable residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy and event-free survival (EFS) as primary endpoints. The two research questions are addressed in a 2 by 2 factorial design. Patients age 60 years and older are upfront randomized 1:1 in one of the two induction arms: GO administered to intensive induction therapy on days 1,4, and 7 versus GO administered once on day 1 (GO-147 versus GO-1), and double-blinded 1:1 in one of the subsequent treatment arms glasdegib vs. placebo as adjunct to consolidation therapy and as single-agent maintenance therapy for six months. Chemotherapy backbone for induction therapy consists of standard 7 + 3 schedule with cytarabine 200 mg/m(2) continuously days 1 to 7, daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) days 1, 2, and 3 and high-dose cytarabine (1 g/m(2), bi-daily, days 1, 2, and 3) for consolidation therapy. Addressing two primary endpoints, MRD-negativity after induction therapy and event-free survival (EFS), 252 evaluable patients are needed to reject each of the two null hypotheses at a two-sided significance level of 2.5% with a power of at least 85%. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval and approvals from the local and federal competent authorities were granted. Trial results will be reported via peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences and scientific meetings. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version: 1st version 20.10.2020, no amendments yet.

The specific Anexelekto/MER Tyrosine Kinase (AXL) inhibitor ONO-7475 kills FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells with targets including Extracellular-signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) and Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL1). ERK and MCL1 are known resistance factors for Venetoclax (ABT-199), a popular drug for AML therapy, prompting the investigation of the efficacy of ONO-7475 in combination with ABT-199 in vitro and in vivo. ONO-7475 synergizes with ABT-199 to potently kill FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary cells. ONO-7475 is effective against ABT-199-resistant cells including cells that overexpress MCL1. Proteomic analyses revealed that ABT-199-resistant cells expressed elevated levels of pro-growth and anti-apoptotic proteins compared to parental cells, and that ONO-7475 reduced the expression of these proteins in both the parental and ABT-199-resistant cells. ONO-7475 treatment significantly extended survival as a single agent in vivo using acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and PDX models. Compared to ONO-7474 monotherapy, the combination of ONO- 7475/ABT-199 was even more potent in reducing leukemic burden and prolonging survival of mice in both model systems. These results suggest the ONO-7475/ABT-199 combination may be effective for acute myeloid leukemia therapy.",,"['Post, Sean M', 'Ma, Huaxian', 'Malaney, Prerna', 'Zhang, Xiaorui', 'Aitken, Marisa J L', 'Mak, Po Yee', 'Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Yasuhiro, Tomoko', 'Kozaki, Ryohei', 'Chan, Lauren E', 'Ostermann, Lauren B', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Andreeff, Michael D', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Ruvolo, Peter P']","['Post SM', 'Ma H', 'Malaney P', 'Zhang X', 'Aitken MJL', 'Mak PY', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Yasuhiro T', 'Kozaki R', 'Chan LE', 'Ostermann LB', 'Konopleva M', 'Carter BZ', 'DiNardo C', 'Andreeff MD', 'Khoury JD', 'Ruvolo PP']","['Department of Leukemia.

Chemical screening of primary human AML specimens by our group led to the identification of lipophilic statins as potent inhibitors of AMLs from a wide range of cytogenetic groups. Genetic screening to identify modulators of the statin response uncovered the role of protein geranylgeranylation and of RAB proteins, coordinating various aspect of vesicular trafficking, in mediating the effects of statins on AML cell viability. We further show that statins can inhibit vesicle-mediated transport in primary human specimens, and that statins sensitive samples show expression signatures reminiscent of enhanced vesicular trafficking. Overall, this study sheds light into the mechanism of action of statins in AML and identifies a novel vulnerability for cytogenetically diverse AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Krosl, Jana', 'Bordeleau, Marie-Eve', 'Moison, Celine', 'MacRae, Tara', 'Boivin, Isabel', 'Mayotte, Nadine', 'Gracias, Deanne', 'Baccelli, Irene', 'Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Bisaillon, Richard', 'Lehnertz, Bernhard', 'Mendoza-Sanchez, Rodrigo', 'Ruel, Rejean', 'Bertomeu, Thierry', 'Coulombe-Huntington, Jasmin', 'Boucher, Genevieve', 'Noronha, Nandita', 'Pabst, Caroline', 'Tyers, Mike', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Barabe, Frederic', 'Marinier, Anne', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Krosl J', 'Bordeleau ME', 'Moison C', 'MacRae T', 'Boivin I', 'Mayotte N', 'Gracias D', 'Baccelli I', 'Lavallee VP', 'Bisaillon R', 'Lehnertz B', 'Mendoza-Sanchez R', 'Ruel R', 'Bertomeu T', 'Coulombe-Huntington J', 'Boucher G', 'Noronha N', 'Pabst C', 'Tyers M', 'Gendron P', 'Lemieux S', 'Barabe F', 'Marinier A', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G']","['IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Montreal, Qu, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Montreal, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Universite de montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Canada.', 'IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211103,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/11/04 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/11/03 20:12'],"['2021/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/03 20:12 [entrez]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['477775 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006047 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Nov 3. pii: 477775. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006047.,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5313-7057', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4611-1470', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9716-5909', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9829-2600', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5477-1386', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0116-8345']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a post-hoc analysis of the GIMEMA AML1310 trial to investigate the applicability of the ELN2017 risk stratification to our study population. In this trial, after induction and consolidation, patients in complete remission were to receive autologous stem cell transplant (AuSCT) if categorized as favorable-risk or allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) if adverse-risk. Intermediate-risk pts were to receive AuSCT or ASCT based on the post-consolidation levels of Measurable Residual Disease as measured by flow-cytometry. Risk categorization was originally conducted according to NCCN2009 recommendations. Among 500 patients, 445 (89%) were re-classified according to the ELN2017 criteria: ELN2017-FR (186/455; 41.8%), ELN2017-IR (179/445 40.2%) and ELN2017-AR (80/455; 18%); in 55 patients (11%) ELN2017 was not applicable (ELN2017-NC). Two-year overall survival (OS) was 68.8%, 51.3%, 45.8% and 42.8% for ELN2017-FR, ELN2017-IR, ELN2017-NC, and ELN2017-AR group, respectively (p<0.001). When comparing the two different transplant strategies in each ELN2017 risk category, a significant benefit of AuSCT over ASCT was observed among ELN2017-FR patients (2-years OS of 83.3% vs. 66.7%; p=0.0421). The two transplant procedures performed almost equally in the ELN2017-IR group (2-years OS of 73.9% vs. 70.8%; p=0.5552). This post-hoc analysis of the GIMEMA AML1310 trial, confirms that the ELN2017 classification is able to accurately discriminate patients with different outcomes and who may benefit from different transplant strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Buccisano, Francesco', 'Palmieri, Raffaele', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Arena, Valentina', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Calafiore, Valeria', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'De Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Storti, Gabriella', 'Salutari, Prassede', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Capria, Saveria', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Paterno, Giovangiacinto', 'Irno Consalvo, Maria Antonietta', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Arcese, William', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Buccisano F', 'Palmieri R', 'Piciocchi A', 'Arena V', 'Candoni A', 'Melillo L', 'Calafiore V', 'Cairoli R', 'De Fabritiis P', 'Storti G', 'Salutari P', 'Lanza F', 'Martinelli G', 'Luppi M', 'Capria S', 'Maurillo L', 'Del Principe MI', 'Paterno G', 'Irno Consalvo MA', 'Ottone T', 'Lavorgna S', 'Voso MT', 'Fazi P', 'Vignetti M', 'Arcese W', 'Venditti A']","['Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita di Roma ""Tor Vergata"", Roma, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Roma, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, UO di Ematologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'AOU Poloclinico-Vittorio Emanuele - Department of Hematology, Catania, Italy.', 'ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy.', ""Sant' Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy."", ""AORN ' San G.

In patients with Ph-chromosome+ chronic myeloid leukemia, acceleration of disease is typically accompanied by marked basophilia. In other myeloid neoplasms, secondary leukemic expansion of basophils is rarely seen. We report on 5 patients who suffered from a myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, or acute leukemia and developed a massive expansion of basophils during disease progression. In 4 of 5 patients, peripheral blood basophil counts reached 40%, and the diagnosis ""secondary basophilic leukemia"" was established. As assessed by flow cytometry, neoplastic basophils expressed CD9, CD18, CD25, CD33, CD63, PD-L1, CD123, and CLL-1. In addition, basophils were found to display BB1 (basogranulin), 2D7, tryptase and KIT. In 4 of 5 patients the disease progressed quickly and treatment with azacitidine was started. However, azacitidine did not induce major clinical responses, and all patients died from progressive disease within 3 Y. In in vitro experiments, the patients cells and the basophilic leukemia cell line KU812 showed variable responses to targeted drugs, including azacitidine, venetoclax, hydroxyurea, and cytarabine. A combination of venetoclax and azacitidine induced cooperative antineoplastic effects in these cells. Together, secondary basophilic leukemia has a poor prognosis and monotherapy with azacitidine is not sufficient to keep the disease under control for longer time-periods.

The prepared pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines have been screened for their antitumor activity in vitro at NCI-DTP. Thereafter, compound 8a was qualified by NCI for full panel five-dose assay to assess its GI50, TGI and LC50 values. Compound 8a showed broad-spectrum anti-proliferative activities over the whole NCI panel, with outstanding growth inhibition full panel GI50 (MG-MID) value equals 2.16 muM and subpanel GI50 (MG-MID) range: 1.92-2.86 muM. Furthermore, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines 8a, 8e-h, 8o, 8u, 11a, 11e, 11h, 11l and 14a-b were assayed for their antiproliferative effect against a panel of leukemia cell lines (K562, MV4-11, CEM, RS4;11, ML-2 and KOPN-8) where they possessed moderate to excellent anti-leukemic activity. Moreover, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines 8o, 8u, 14a and 14b were further explored for their effect on cell cycle on RS4;11 cells, in which they dose-dependently increased populations of cells in G2/M phases. Finally we analyzed the changes of selected proteins (HOXA9, MEIS1, PARP, BcL-2 and McL-1) related to cell death and viability in RS4;11 cells via Western blotting.

Little is known about the function and the prognostic value of distinct FGFs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We used dataset from Beat AML to screen the FGFs family in AML by log-rank test. Subsequently, we identified the biological functions and the crucial signaling pathways associated with these screened FGFs using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In addition, IC50 from 122 small-molecule inhibitors was used to explore the relationship between these signaling pathways and targets of sensitive inhibitors. RESULTS: Among the FGFs family, over expressions of FGF10/FGF17 were found to be significantly associated with poor prognosis. FGF10 over expression was related to FLT3 and NPM1 mutations, and FGF17 over expression was linked to MUC12 and ZRSR2 mutations. Some cancer-related pathways such as PI3K-Akt, MAPK were significantly enriched by GSEA, and these pathways were concordant with sensitive inhibitors targeted pathways. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that FGF10 and FGF17 could be prognostic biomarkers for survivals of AML patients, and potential therapeutic targets for small-molecule inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Hereby, in this study, we primarily aimed to investigate the distribution of genetic mutations in AML patients. We also attempted to analyze the incidence of genetic mutations in AML patients from Turkey.This retrospective study included a total of 126 patients diagnosed with AML, who had molecular mutation test results or records in their patient files. The patients who were not citizens of the Republic of Turkey were not included in the study.It was observed that analyses for at least 1 c-kit exon mutation had been carried out on 76 patients, which detected no c-kit mutation among the types of genetic mutations investigated in all of those 76 patients. We found the frequency of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication mutation as 25%. The prevalence of translocation(15;17) was approximately 11% and the prevalence of translocation(8;21) was % 6.25. In addition, we also showed that the frequency of inversion16 was nearly 3.7%.Lastly, the possibility of c-kit mutation in AML patients from Turkey might actually be low.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Medical radiation workers are a major component of the Million Person Study (MPS) of low-dose health effects. Annual personal dose equivalents, HP(10), for individual workers are available to facilitate dose-response analyses for lung cancer, leukemia, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and other causes of death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Landauer, Inc. dosimetry database identified 109,019 medical and associated radiation workers first monitored 1965-1994. Vital status and cause of death were determined through 2016. Mean absorbed doses to red bone marrow (RBM), lung, heart, and other organs were estimated by adjusting the recorded HP(10) for each worker by scaling factors, accounting for exposure geometry, energy of the incident photon radiation, sex of the worker and whether an apron was worn. There were 4 exposure scenarios: general radiology characterized by low-energy x-ray exposure with no lead apron use, interventional radiologists/cardiologists who wore aprons, nuclear medicine personnel and radiation oncologists exposed to high-energy photon radiation, and other workers. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) analyses were performed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate organ-specific radiation risks. RESULTS: Overall, 11,433 deaths occurred (SMR 0.60; 95%CI 0.59,0.61), 126 from leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 850 from lung cancer, and 1,654 from IHD. The mean duration of monitoring was 23.7 y. The excess relative rate (ERR) per 100 mGy was estimated as 0.10 (95% CI -0.34, 0.54) for leukemia other than CLL, 0.15 (0.02, 0.27) for lung cancer, and -0.10 (-0.27, 0.06) for IHD. The ERR for lung cancer was 0.16 (0.01, 0.32) among the 55,218 male workers and 0.09 (-0.19, 0.36) among the 53,801 female workers; a difference that was not statistically significant (p value =0.062). CONCLUSIONS: Medical radiation workers were at increased risk for lung cancer that was higher among men than women, although this difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors exposed briefly to radiation in 1945 found females to be nearly 3 times the radiation risk of lung cancer compared with males on a relative scale. For medical workers, there no statistically significant radiation-associations with leukemia excluding CLL, IHD or other specific causes of death. Combining these data with other cohorts within the MPS, such as nuclear power plant workers and industrial radiographers, will enable more precise estimates of radiation risks at relatively low cumulative doses.",,"['Boice, John D Jr', 'Cohen, Sarah S', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Howard, Sara C', 'Yoder, R Craig', 'Dauer, Lawrence T']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Cohen SS', 'Mumma MT', 'Howard SC', 'Yoder RC', 'Dauer LT']","['National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'EpidStrategies, a Division of ToxStrategies, Cary, NC, USA.', 'International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'ORISE Health Studies Program, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.', 'Landauer Inc (Retired)., Glenwood, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211103,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,,,2021/11/04 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/11/03 17:16'],"['2021/11/03 17:16 [entrez]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/09553002.2021.1967508 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Radiat Biol. 2021 Nov 3:1-63. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2021.1967508.,,,1-63,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8755-1299', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0421-1983', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7506-8710', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5629-8462']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indoluidin D also suppressed cell growth in various other types of cancer cells. Cancer cell sensitivity profiling with JFCR39 and proteomic profiling with ChemProteoBase revealed that indoluidin D is a DHODH inhibitor. Indoluidin D inhibited human DHODH activity in vitro; the DHODH reaction product orotic acid rescued indoluidin D-induced cell differentiation. We synthesized several indoluidin D diastereomer derivatives and demonstrated that stereochemistry was vital to their molecular activity.

Here in our study, we found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a once clinically approved medication for child acute myelogenous leukemia, inhibited multiple strains of HSV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo. 6-TG is more potent than acyclovir (ACV) and ganciclovir (GCV), with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6-TG at 0.104 muM with high stimulation index (SI) (SI = 6,475.48) compared to the IC50 of ACV at 1.253 muM and the IC50 of GCV at 1.257 muM. In addition, 6-TG at 500 muM topically applied to the eyes with HSV-1 infection significantly inhibits HSV-1 replication, alleviates virus-induced HSK pathogenesis, and improves eye conditions. More importantly, 6-TG is effective against ACV-resistant HSV-1 strains, including HSV-1/153 and HSV-1/blue. Knockdown of Rac1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) negatively affected HSV-1 replication, suggesting that Rac1 facilitated HSV-1 replication. Following HSV-1 infection of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), endogenous Rac1 activity was upregulated by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. We further found that Rac1 was highly expressed in the corneal tissue of HSK patients compared to normal individuals. Mechanistic study showed that 6-TG inhibited HSV-1 replication by targeting Rac1 activity in HSV-1 infected cells, and the Rac1 is critical in the pathogenesis of HSK. Our results indicated that 6-TG is a promising therapeutic molecule for the treatment of HSK. IMPORTANCE We reported the discovery of 6-TG inhibition of HSV-1 infection and its inhibitory roles in HSK both in vitro and in vivo. 6-TG was shown to possess at least 10x more potent inhibitory activity against HSV-1 than ACV and GCV and, more importantly, inhibit ACV/GCV-resistant mutant viruses. Animal model studies showed that gel-formulated 6-TG topically applied to eyes locally infected with HSV-1 could significantly inhibit HSV-1 replication, alleviate virus-induced HSK pathogenesis, and improve eye conditions. Further study showed that HSV-1 infection upregulated Rac1 expression, and knockdown of Rac1 using siRNA markedly restricted HSV-1 replication, suggesting that Rac1 is required for HSV-1 replication. In addition, we also documented that Rac1 is highly expressed in corneal tissues from HSK patients, indicating that Rac1 is associated with HSK pathogenesis. In view of the high potency of 6-TG, low cytotoxicity, targeting a distinct therapeutic target, we suggest that 6-TG is a potential candidate for development as a therapeutic agent for HSK therapy.",,"['Chen, Deyan', 'Liu, Ye', 'Zhang, Fang', 'You, Qiao', 'Ma, Wenyuan', 'Wu, Jing', 'Wu, Zhiwei']","['Chen D', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang F', 'You Q', 'Ma W', 'Wu J', 'Wu Z']","['Medical School of Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, JinLing Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Medical School of Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Medical School of Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Medical School of Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', ""School of Life Sciences, Ningxia University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."", 'Center for Public Health Research, Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37 Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, China.', ""Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Medical School, Nanjing Universitygrid.41156.37, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211103,United States,Microbiol Spectr,Microbiology spectrum,101634614,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*6-thioguanine', '*HSK', '*HSV-1', '*Rac1']",2021/11/04 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/11/03 12:12'],"['2021/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/03 12:12 [entrez]']",['10.1128/Spectrum.00646-21 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Spectr. 2021 Dec 22;9(3):e0064621. doi: 10.1128/Spectrum.00646-21.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) provide an attractive approach to HSCT conditioning that minimizes toxicity while retaining efficacy. Initial studies of ADC conditioning have largely focused on syngeneic HSCT. However, to treat acute leukemias or induce tolerance for solid organ transplantation, this approach must be expanded to allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). Using murine allo-HSCT models, we show that pharmacologic Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibition combined with CD45- or cKit-targeted ADCs enables robust multilineage alloengraftment. Strikingly, myeloid lineage donor chimerism exceeding 99% was achievable in fully MHC-mismatched HSCT using this approach. Mechanistic studies using the JAK1/2 inhibitor baricitinib revealed marked impairment of T and NK cell survival, proliferation, and effector function. NK cells were exquisitely sensitive to JAK1/2 inhibition due to interference with IL-15 signaling. Unlike irradiated mice, ADC-conditioned mice did not develop pathogenic graft-versus-host alloreactivity when challenged with mismatched T cells. Finally, the combination of ADCs and baricitinib balanced graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-leukemia responses in delayed donor lymphocyte infusion models. Our allo-HSCT conditioning strategy exemplifies the promise of immunotherapy to improve the safety of HSCT for treating hematologic diseases.",,"['Persaud, Stephen P', 'Ritchey, Julie K', 'Kim, Sena', 'Lim, Sora', 'Ruminski, Peter G', 'Cooper, Matthew L', 'Rettig, Michael P', 'Choi, Jaebok', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Persaud SP', 'Ritchey JK', 'Kim S', 'Lim S', 'Ruminski PG', 'Cooper ML', 'Rettig MP', 'Choi J', 'DiPersio JF']","['Division of Laboratory and Genomic Medicine, Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow transplantation', '*Immunology', '*Immunotherapy', '*Mouse models', '*Transplantation']",2021/11/04 06:00,2022/01/07 06:00,['2021/11/03 08:45'],"['2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/03 08:45 [entrez]']","['145501 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI145501 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Dec 15;131(24). pii: 145501. doi: 10.1172/JCI145501.,131,24,,20220106,"['Allografts', 'Animals', 'Azetidines/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC8670850,"['P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['0 (Azetidines)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'ISP4442I3Y (baricitinib)']",,,['2022/03/15 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown that spontaneous and random mutants of CSF2RB can lead to ligand independence in vitro. To date, no report(s) have been shown for the presence of potentially transforming and oncogenic CSF2RB mutation(s) clinically in cancer patients until the first reported case of a leukemia patient in 2016 harboring a germline-activating mutation (R461C). We combined exome sequencing, pathway analyses, and functional assays to identify novel somatic mutations in KAIMRC1 cells and breast tumor specimen. The patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) exome served as a germline control in the identification of somatic mutations. Here, we report the discovery of a novel potentially transforming and oncogenic somatic mutation (S230I) in the CSF2RB gene of a breast cancer patient and the cell line, KAIMRC1 established from her breast tumor tissue. KAIMRC1 cells are immortalized and shown to survive and proliferate in ligand starvation condition. Immunoblot analysis showed that mutant CSF2RB signals through JAK2/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathways in ligand starvation conditions. Screening a small molecule kinase inhibitor library revealed potent JAK2 inhibitors against KAIMRC1 cells. We, for the first time, identified a somatic, potentially transforming, and oncogenic CSF2RB mutation (S230I) in breast cancer patients that seem to be an actionable mutation leading to the development of new therapeutics for breast cancer.","['(c) 2021 King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC).

This study aimed to explore the correlation of IER3 with AML risk, clinical characteristics, complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). METHODS: A total of 93 de novo AML patients were included in this study. In addition, 30 patients with non-hyperplasia hematologic malignancies requiring bone marrow testing (as disease controls) and 30 health donors (as health controls) were also recruited. Bone morrow samples of AML patients (before treatment), disease controls (before treatment), and health controls (at donation) were collected. IER3 in bone marrow mononuclear cells was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: IER3 was increased in AML patients compared with disease controls and health donors (both P < .001), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that IER3 had certain capability of distinguishing AML patients from disease controls (area under curve (AUC): 0.735, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.650-0.820), and health donors (AUC: 0.789, 95% CI: 0.712-0.866). Meanwhile, IER3 was correlated with FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .030) and poor NCCN risk stratification (P = .031) in AML patients. Moreover, IER3 had negative association with CR in AML patients (P = .022), and showed certain potential in discriminating CR patients from non-CR patients (AUC: 0.655, 95% CI: 0.533-0.777).

Overall/major response rates were 77%/45% for adv-SM and 70%/60% for ISM/SSM, and median (range) duration of response 10 (4-75) and 46 (4-140) months respectively. A >50% reduction in bone marrow mast cell burden and serum tryptase level was documented in 63% and 67% of patients with adv-SM and 50% and 46% with ISM/SSM respectively.

Its restricted expression in immune-privileged normal tissues suggest that SSX2 may be a relevant target antigen for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy. We have developed a T cell receptor (TCR)-like antibody (Fab/3) that binds SSX2 peptide 41-49 (KASEKIFYV) in the context of HLA-A *-0201. The sequence of Fab/3 was utilized to engineer a CAR with the CD3 zeta intra-cellular domain along with either a CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory endodomain. Human T cells from HLA-A2(+) donors were transduced to mediate anti-tumor activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor cells. Upon challenge with HLA-A2(+)/SSX2(+) AML tumor cells, CAR-expressing T cells released interferon-gamma and eliminated the tumor cells in a long-term co-culture assay. Using the HLA-A2(+) T2 cell line, we demonstrated a strong specificity of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) for SSX2 p41-49 and the closely related SSX3 p41-49, with no response against the others SSX-homologous peptides or unrelated homologous peptides.

We demonstrated that LW-218, a synthetic flavonoid, induced rapid lysosomal enlargement accompanied with lysosomal membrane permeabilization in hematological malignancy. LW-218-induced lysosomal damage and lysosome-dependent cell death were mediated by cathepsin D, as the lysosomal damage and cell apoptosis could be suppressed by depletion of cathepsin D or lysosome alkalization agents, which can alter the activity of cathepsins. Lysophagy, was initiated for cell self-rescue after LW-218 treatment and correlated with calcium release and nuclei translocation of transcription factor EB. LW-218 treatment enhanced the expression of autophagy-related genes which could be inhibited by intracellular calcium chelator. Sustained exposure to LW-218 exhausted the lysosomal capacity so as to repress the normal autophagy. LW-218-induced enlargement and damage of lysosomes were triggered by abnormal cholesterol deposition on lysosome membrane which caused by interaction between LW-218 and NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1. Moreover, LW-218 inhibited the leukemia cell growth in vivo. Thus, the necessary impact of integral lysosomal function in cell rescue and death were illustrated.","['(c) 2021 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica,', 'Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

He quickly transformed into a blast crisis phase after five months of therapy with imatinib regardless of achieving an excellent initial optimal response. In conclusion, it is possible to transform into a blast phase despite achieving an initial optimal response. Therefore, attention should be focused on the selection of proper tyrosine kinase inhibitors and careful monitoring to allow the early detection of sudden blast crisis.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Vijaya Prakash et al.']","['Vijaya Prakash, Aviraag', 'Sivakolundu, Keerthana P', 'Savage, Natasha M', 'Kota, Vamsi K', 'Shoukier, Mahran']","['Vijaya Prakash A', 'Sivakolundu KP', 'Savage NM', 'Kota VK', 'Shoukier M']","['Department of General Medicine, Employees State Insurance Corporation Medical College, Bangalore, IND.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210928,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['bcr-abl', 'blast crisis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (cml)', 'imatinib', 'rt- qpcr', 'tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors']",2021/11/04 06:00,2021/11/04 06:01,['2021/11/03 06:57'],"['2021/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/03 06:57 [entrez]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.18368 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Sep 28;13(9):e18368. doi: 10.7759/cureus.18368. eCollection 2021 Sep.,13,9,e18368,,,PMC8555935,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MyPal is a Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation Action aiming to meet this challenge and foster palliative care for patients with CLL or MDS by leveraging ePRO systems to adapt to the personal needs of patients and caregiver(s). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this interventional randomised trial, 300 patients with CLL or MDS will be recruited across Europe. Patients will be randomly allocated to early palliative care using the MyPal system (n=150) versus standard care including general palliative care if needed (n=150). Patients in the experimental arm will be given access to the MyPal digital health platform which consists of purposely designed software available on smartphones and/or tablets. The platform entails different functionalities including physical and psychoemotional symptom reporting via regular questionnaire completion, spontaneous self-reporting, motivational messages, medication management and a personalised search engine for health information. Data on patients' activity (daily steps and sleep quality) will be automatically collected via wearable devices. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The integration of ePROs via mobile applications has raised ethical concerns regarding inclusion criteria, information provided to participants, free and voluntary consent, and respect for their autonomy. These have been carefully addressed by a multidisciplinary team. Data processing, dissemination and exploitation of the study findings will take place in full compliance with European Union data protection law. A participatory design was adopted in the development of the digital platform involving focus groups and discussions with patients to identify needs and preferences. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of San Raffaele (8/2020), Thessaloniki 'George Papanikolaou' Hospital (849), Karolinska Institutet (20.10.2020), University General Hospital of Heraklion (07/15.4.2020) and University of Brno (01-120220/EK).

Therefore recurring cytogenetic abnormalities have been used to segregate patients into favorable, intermediate, and adverse prognostic risk groups. However, it is unclear how expression of genes is associated with these prognostic risk groups. We postulate that expression of genes monotonically associated with these prognostic risk groups may yield important insights into leukemogenesis. Therefore, in this paper we propose penalized Bayesian ordinal response models to predict prognostic risk group using gene expression data. We consider a double exponential prior, a spike-and-slab normal prior, a spike-and-slab double exponential prior, and a regression-based approach with variable inclusion indicators for modeling our high-dimensional ordinal response, prognostic risk group, and identify genes through hypothesis tests using Bayes factor. RESULTS: Gene expression was ascertained using Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2.0 GeneChips for 97 favorable, 259 intermediate, and 97 adverse risk AML patients. When applying our penalized Bayesian ordinal response models, genes identified for model inclusion were consistent among the four different models. Additionally, the genes included in the models were biologically plausible, as most have been previously associated with either AML or other types of cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that our proposed penalized Bayesian ordinal response models are useful for performing variable selection for high-dimensional genomic data and have the potential to identify genes relevantly associated with an ordinal phenotype.",['(c) 2021.

Long-term exposure to heavy metals (aluminium and iron) cause neurotoxicity by amyloid plaques accumulation, tau phosphorylation, increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cholinergic neurons degeneration, contributes to the development of AD-like symptoms. The present research work is designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of spermine in aluminium chloride (AlCl3), and iron (Fe) induced AD-like symptoms in rats. Rats were administered of AlCl3 (100 mg/kg p.o.) alone and in combination with iron (120 mug/g, p.o.) for 28 days. Spermine (5 and 10 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal (i.p.) route was given for 14 days. The recognition and spatial memory impairment were tasted using Morris water maze (MWM), actophotometer, and Novel Object Recognition test (NORT). All the rats were sacrificed on day 29, brains were isolated, and tissue homogenate was used for neuroinflammatory, biochemical, neurotransmitters, metals concentration, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) analysis. In the present study, AlCl3 and iron administration elevated oxidative stress, cytokines release, dysbalanced neurotransmitters concentration, and biochemical changes. Rats treated with spermine dose-dependently improved the recognition and spatial memory, attenuated proinflammatory cytokine release, and restored neurotransmitters concentration and antioxidant enzymes. Spermine also mitigated the increased beta-amyloid (Abeta42), with downregulation of tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, spermine augmented the hippocampal levels of B cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), diminished nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and caspase-3 (casp-3) expression. Moreover, spermine exhibited the neuroprotective effect through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neurotransmitters restoration, anti-apoptotic Abeta42 concentration.","['(c) 2021.

Importantly, antibiotics attenuated inflammation and B-cell defects in preleukemic Cdkn2a-/-Il10-/- mice. In an ETV6-RUNX1+ (E6R1+) Cdkn2a-/- mouse model of B-ALL, decreased levels of IL-10 accelerated B cell neoplasms in a dose dependent manner, and altered the mutational profile of these neoplasms.

Why LSCs are selectively resistant against elimination by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that LSCs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can be recognized and killed by CD8+ CTLs in vitro. However, Tregs, which preferentially localized close to CD8+ CTLs in CML BM, protected LSCs from MHC class I-dependent CD8+ CTL-mediated elimination in vivo. BM Tregs in CML were characterized by the selective expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor 4 (Tnfrsf4). Stimulation of Tnfrsf4 signaling did not deplete Tregs but reduced the capacity of Tregs to protect LSCs from CD8+ CTL-mediated killing. In the BM of newly diagnosed CML patients, TNFRSF4 mRNA levels were significantly increased and correlated with the expression of the Treg-restricted transcription factor FOXP3.

The protein menin is regarded as a critical oncogenic cofactor of the resulting MLL fusion proteins in acute leukemia. A direct interaction between menin and the MLL amino terminal sequences is necessary for MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemogenesis. Thus, inhibition of the interaction between menin and MLL has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy.

Neonatal exposure to the carcinogenic N-N'ethylnitrosourea (ENU), a NOC has been established to cause leukemogenesis. Our world is constantly battling against cancer with consistent investigations of new anti-cancer therapeutics. Plant derived compounds have grasped worldwide attention of researchers for their promising anti-cancer potentials. Eclipta prostrata is one such ayurvedic herb, renowned for its anti-inflammatory properties. Currently, it has been explored in various cancer cell lines to establish its anti-cancer effect, but rarely in in-vivo cancer models. Wedelolactone (WDL), the major coumestan of E. prostrata is recognized as an inhibitor of IKK, a master regulator of the NF-kB inflammatory pathway. As persistent inflammation and activated inflammasome contribute to leukemogenesis, we tried to observe anti-leukemogenic efficacy of E. prostrata and its active compound WDL on the marrow cells of ENU induced experimental leukemic mice. Treatment groups were administered an oral gavage at a dose of 1200 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg b.w of crude extract and WDL respectively for 4 weeks. Various parameters like hemogram, survivability, cytological and histological investigations, migration assay, cell culture, flowcytometry and confocal microscopy were taken into consideration pre- and post-treatment. Interestingly, the plant concoction portrayed maximum effects in comparison to WDL alone. The study suggests E. prostrata and WDL as vital complementary adjuncts for anti-inflammasome mechanism in ENU-induced leukemia.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Bhattacharyya, Subhashree', 'Law, Sujata']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Law S']","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211102,United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Eclipta prostrata', ""N-N' ethylnitrosourea"", 'bone marrow', 'inflammasome', 'leukemia', 'wedelolactone']",2021/11/03 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2021/11/02 12:30'],"['2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/02 12:30 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.23400 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2022 Feb;37(2):322-334. doi: 10.1002/tox.23400.

Reportedly, skin rash is an adverse event in up to 27% of treated patients. Histopathologic description of these lesions is limited. We present two cases of ibrutinib-associated skin toxicities showing diverse histopathologic features. Case 1: A 72-year-old man was started on ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Two months later, he developed multiple erythematous crusted papules on the chest, abdomen, and extremities. Biopsies revealed varied histopathology including poorly formed granulomatous dermatitis, epidermal necrosis, ulceration, and panniculitis. Ibrutinib was discontinued and his skin lesions resolved within 1 month. Case 2: A 48-year-old man received ibrutinib after failing standard therapy for primary central nervous system EBV positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Two months after initiation of ibrutinib, he developed multiple firm, red, non-tender nodules on the forehead, buttock, and thigh. Biopsies revealed ""pseudolymphoma""-like reaction with dense pandermal lymphohistiocytic inflammation and granulomas. His skin toxicity resolved without cessation of therapy.

This review focuses on the expression of genetically incompatible A/B/FORS1 antigens in cancer. Several possible molecular mechanisms are exemplified, including missense mutations that alter the sugar specificity of A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT, respectively), restoration of the correct codon reading frame of O alleles, and modification of acceptor specificity of AT to synthesize the FORS1 antigen by missense mutations and/or altered splicing.

Prospective treatment-related toxicities registered every three-month interval were used. Patients were classified according to sex- and age-adjusted international childhood cut-off values, corresponding to adult body mass index: underweight, <17 kg/m(2) ; healthy weight, 17 to <25 kg/m(2) ; overweight, 25 to <30 kg/m(2) ; and obese, >/=30 kg/m(2) . Obese children had a higher incidence rate ratio (IRR) for severe toxic events {IRR: 1.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.50]}, liver and kidney failures, bleeding, abdominal complication, suspected unexpected severe adverse reactions and hyperlipidaemia compared with healthy-weight children. Obese children aged >/=10 years had increased IRRs for asparaginase-related toxicities compared with healthy-weight older children: thromboses [IRR 2.87 (95% CI 1.00-8.21)] and anaphylactic reactions [IRR 7.95 (95% CI 2.15-29.37)] as well as higher risk for truncation of asparaginase [IRR 3.54 (95% CI 1.67-7.50)].

It has been postulated that this population experiences toxicities at a higher rate and with a faster onset than the general population when treated with chemotherapy or biotherapy. The published clinical trials that have evaluated chemotherapy/biotherapy efficacy and toxicity have not adequately represented the Hispanic/Latinx population. This retrospective analysis aims to analyze the incidence and severity of adverse drug events in the Hispanic/Latinx population compared to the general study population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review included patients reported as Hispanic/Latinx in the electronic medical record who had breast cancer, colon cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, or multiple myeloma currently receiving chemotherapy/biotherapy and/or received chemotherapy/biotherapy during the study period. Seventy-three instances of patients receiving chemotherapy/biotherapy and 46 unique patients were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Of the 73 instances, 29 (40%) had toxicity at baseline prior to chemotherapy/biotherapy received during the study period. Of those 29 baseline toxicities, 26 (90%) of them had new toxicity during the study period. Of the 73 instances, 62 (85%) experienced toxicities during the study period. CONCLUSION: Ethnicity has a proven effect on medication efficacy and safety, but the specific impact of ethnicity on chemotherapy/biotherapy toxicity risk has not been well elucidated. This study found that a majority (85%) of Hispanic/Latinx patients treated with chemotherapy/biotherapy experienced toxicity of any grade, and the majority (90%) patients who had prior toxicity experienced another toxicity.",,"['Leidy, Sara B', 'Hull, Lauren R', 'Macik, Monica R', 'Gonzalvo, Jasmine D', 'Weddle, Kellie J']","['Leidy SB', 'Hull LR', 'Macik MR', 'Gonzalvo JD', 'Weddle KJ']","['Purdue University College of Pharmacy, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', 'Purdue University College of Pharmacy, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '439399Eskenazi Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', '439399Eskenazi Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, 311308Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Purdue University, Center for Health Equity and Innovation, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '439399Eskenazi Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, 311308Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211102,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'adverse drug events', 'biotherapy', 'ethnicity', 'toxicity']",2021/11/03 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/11/02 08:46'],"['2021/11/02 08:46 [entrez]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211053248 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Nov 2:10781552211053248. doi: 10.1177/10781552211053248.,,,10781552211053248,,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3794-784X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is some controversy regarding the main criteria for offering patients this treatment. This article aims to describe the applied indications for cryopreservation and autotransplantation of ovarian tissue. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This review article is based on literature searches in the Embase and Medline databases, restricted to articles published from 2010 onwards. RESULTS: A total of twelve articles were included, with diagnoses for 1 947 patients in the age group 0-44 years and 820 patients aged less than 18 years. The most frequent indications for cryopreservation of ovarian tissue were breast cancer (694 of 1 947, 36 %) and lymphoma (416 of 1 947, 21 %). Malignant diseases accounted for 86 % of indications. In patients aged less than 18 years, malignant neurological diseases (166 of 820, 20 %), leukaemia (156 of 820, 19 %), sarcomas (125 of 820, 15 %) and benign haematological disorders (124 of 820, 15 %) were the most common indications. In patients aged less than 18 years, 26 % of the indications were benign disorders. The most frequent indications for autotransplantation of ovarian tissue were lymphoma (74 of 196, 38 %) and breast cancer (53 of 196, 27 %). INTERPRETATION: The frequency of the indications is consistent with the prevalence of the diseases, but further experience is necessary to improve the guidelines for the treatment.

To minimize its toxicities, we linked ibrutinib to a cell-targeted, internalizing antibody. To this end, we synthesized a poly-anionic derivate, ibrutinib-Cy3.5, that retains full functionality. This anionic inhibitor is complexed by our anti-CD20-protamine targeting conjugate and free protamine, and thereby spontaneously assembles into an electrostatically stabilized vesicular nanocarrier. The complexation led to an accumulation of the drug driven by the CD20 antigen internalization to the intended cells and an amplification of its pharmacological effectivity. In vivo, we observed a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune-compromised mice and a significantly better response to lower doses compared to the original drug.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

BCR-ABL1 rearrangement is an oncogenic event that is usually associated with chronic myeloid leukemia but also occurs in both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias and in healthy individuals. However, APL with concurrent PML-RARA and BCR-ABL1 rearrangements has rarely been reported. Herein, we describe a patient with APL exhibiting a BCR-ABL1 rearrangement in a minor clone and discuss the importance of evaluating this genetic alteration in terms of pathogenesis and treatment.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

However, the potency of BiTEs in solid tumours is limited by their short half-life and their severe toxicity at relevant therapeutic doses. Here we report the design and in vivo performance of a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets the murine T-cell co-receptor CD3epsilon and the murine immune checkpoint programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1). In multiple syngeneic tumour models, the bispecific antibody generated higher antitumour immune responses than conventional BiTEs targeting tumour-associated antigens and CD3epsilon. We found that the durable antigen-specific T-cell responses resulted from the rejuvenation of CD8 T cells, owing to the blockade of PD-L1 on dendritic cells (but not on tumour cells) and co-stimulation by B7-1&2 (a peripheral membrane protein on dendritic cells). Bispecific T-cell engagers targeting dendritic cells rather than tumour cells may represent a general means of T-cell rejuvenation for durable cancer immunotherapy.","['(c) 2021.

We aimed to assess risk factors of outcome and elucidate the impact of CLL-directed treatments on the course of COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective, international study, collectively including 941 patients with CLL and confirmed COVID-19. Data from the beginning of the pandemic until March 16, 2021, were collected from 91 centers. The risk factors of case fatality rate (CFR), disease severity, and overall survival (OS) were investigated. OS analysis was restricted to patients with severe COVID-19 (definition: hospitalization with need of oxygen or admission into an intensive care unit). CFR in patients with severe COVID-19 was 38.4%. OS was inferior for patients in all treatment categories compared to untreated (p < 0.001). Untreated patients had a lower risk of death (HR = 0.54, 95% CI:0.41-0.72). The risk of death was higher for older patients and those suffering from cardiac failure (HR = 1.03, 95% CI:1.02-1.04; HR = 1.79, 95% CI:1.04-3.07, respectively).

AALL0232 was a Phase 3 randomized Children's Oncology Group trial for newly diagnosed HR B-ALL (1-30 years). Between 2004 and 2011, 3154 patients enrolled with 3040 eligible and evaluable for induction. AYA patients comprised 20% of patients (16-21 years, n = 551; 22-30 years, n = 46). 5-year event-free survival and overall survival was 65.4 +/- 2.2% and 77.4 +/- 2.0% for AYA patients compared to 78.1 +/- 0.9% and 87.3 +/- 0.7% for younger patients (p < 0.0001). Five-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 18.5 +/- 1.7% for AYA patients and 13.5 +/- 0.7% for younger patients (p = 0.006), largely due to increased marrow relapses (14.0 +/- 1.5% versus 9.1 +/- 0.6%; p < 0.0001). Additionally, induction failure rate was higher in AYA (7.2 +/- 1.1% versus 3.5 +/- 0.4%; p < 0.001) and post-induction remission deaths were significantly higher in AYA (5.7 +/- 1.0% versus 2.4 +/- 0.3%; p < 0.0001). AALL0232 enrolled the largest number of AYA B-ALL patients to date, demonstrating significantly inferior survival and greater rates of treatment-related toxicities compared to younger patients. Although treatment intensification has improved outcomes in younger patients, they have not been associated with the same degree of improvement for older patients.","['(c) 2021.

We investigated the role of epigenetic DNA modifications in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnostics and therapy monitoring. We analyzed the levels of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-mdC) oxidation products in the cellular DNA and urine of children with ALL (at diagnosis and during chemotherapy, n = 55) using two-dimensional ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (2D UPLC-MS/MS). Moreover, the expression of Ten Eleven Translocation enzymes (TETs) at the mRNA and protein levels was determined. Additionally, the ascorbate level in the blood plasma was analyzed. Before treatment, the ALL patients had profoundly higher levels of the analyzed modified DNA in their urine than the controls. After chemotherapy, we observed a statistically significant decrease in active demethylation products in urine, with a final level similar to the level characteristic of healthy children. The level of 5-hmdC in the DNA of the leukocytes in blood of the patient group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Our data suggest that urinary excretion of epigenetic DNA modification may be a marker of pediatric ALL status and a reliable marker of chemotherapy response.",['(c) 2021.

In this study, we investigated the capacity of P8-D6 to inhibit myeloma cell growth in vitro and in vivo Growth inhibition assays demonstrated significant anti-myeloma effects against different myeloma cell lines with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Freshly isolated plasma cells of patients with multiple myeloma were killed by P8-D6 with similar doses. P8-D6 activated caspase 3/7 and induced significant apoptosis of myeloma cells. Supportive effects of bone marrow stromal cells on IL6-dependent INA-6 myeloma cells were abrogated by P8-D6 and apoptosis occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Of note, healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were not affected at concentrations toxic for malignant plasma cells.

However, ILs may play the role of toxins. Even though ionic liquids may assist to minimize air pollution, but their discharge into aquatic ecosystems might result in significant water pollution due to their potential toxicity and inaccessibility to biodegradation. Recently, more attention has been paid to the toxicity of ILs on plants, bacteria, and humans. Here, a quantitative structure-toxicity relationship study (QSTR) based on the Monte Carlo method of CORAL software has been applied to estimate the logarithm of the half-maximal effective concentration of toxicity of ILs against leukemia rat cell line IPC-81 (logEC50). A hybrid optimal descriptor is used to build QSTR models for a large set of 304 diverse ILs including ammonium, imidazolium, morpholinium, phosphonium, piperidinium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, quinolinium, sulfonium, and protic ILs. The SMILES notations of ILs are utilized to compute the descriptor correlation weight (DCW). Four splits are made from the whole dataset and each split is randomly divided into four sets (training subsets and validation set). The index of ideality of correlation (IIC) is applied to evaluate the authenticity and robustness of the QSTR models. A QSTR model with statistical parameters R(2) = 0.85, CCC = 0.92, Q(2) = 0.84, and MAE = 0.25 for the validation set of the best split is considered as a prime model. The outliers and promoters of increase/decrease of logEC50 are extracted and the mechanistic interpretation of effective descriptors for the model is also offered.HighlightsGlobal SMILES-based QSAR model was developed to predict the toxicity of ILs.The CORAL software is used to model the ILs toxicity on IPC-81 leukemia rat cell line.IIC is tested as a criterion of predictive potential.The toxicological effects of ILs are discussed based on the proposed model.",,"['Ahmadi, Shahin', 'Lotfi, Shahram', 'Kumar, Parvin']","['Ahmadi S', 'Lotfi S', 'Kumar P']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Payame Noor University (PNU), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211212,England,Toxicol Mech Methods,Toxicology mechanisms and methods,101134521,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['LogEC50', 'QSTR models', 'SMILES', 'ionic liquids', 'leukemia rat cell line IPC-81']",2021/11/03 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/11/02 05:25'],"['2021/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/02 05:25 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15376516.2021.2000686 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Toxicol Mech Methods. 2021 Dec 12:1-11. doi: 10.1080/15376516.2021.2000686.,,,1-11,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0910-9681', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2635-6465']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological and immunological characteristics of umbilical cord blood (UCB) have been re-recognized in recent years. UCB, previously considered medical waste, is rich in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are naive and more energetic and more easily expanded than other stem cells. UCB has been identified as a reliable source of HSCs for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). UCBT has several advantages over other methods, including no harm to mothers and donors, an off-the-shelf product for urgent use, less stringent HLA match, lower incidence and severity of chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and probably a stronger graft-vs-leukemia effect, especially for minimal residual disease-positive patients before transplant. Recent studies have shown that the outcome of UCBT has been improved and is comparable to other types of allo-HSCT. Currently, UCBT is widely used in malignant, nonmalignant, hematological, congenital and metabolic diseases. The number of UCB banks and transplantation procedures increased exponentially before 2013. However, the number of UCBTs increased steadily in Asia and China but decreased in the United States and Europe year-on-year from 2013 to 2019. In this review, we focus on the development of UCBT over the past 30 years, the challenges it faces and the strategies for future improvement, including increasing UCB numbers, cord blood unit selection, conditioning regimens and GVHD prophylaxis for UCBT, and management of complications of UCBT.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

It is well known that allogeneic grafts play a key role in predicting transplantation prognosis. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a functional part of grafts and are capable of reconstructing hematopoiesis and immunity, but purified HSCs have not been identified or isolated to date. In clinical practice, allogeneic grafts have been optimized to improve transplantation outcomes. The optimized grafts are considered to engraft successfully, reconstruct immunity rapidly, and exert a graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect without causing severe graft-vs-host disease (GvHD). In the last several decades, considerable efforts have been made in searching for optimized grafts based on different graft manipulation approaches and different graft sources. Currently, there is no uniform standard for optimized grafts in allogeneic transplantation. In the future, sorting out the cellular elements responsible for the effects of allo-HSCT might be a research direction for further optimization of grafts. In this review, we propose the concept of optimized grafts and summarize the recent advances made in the process of optimizing grafts.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We constructed a pooled safety analysis to better understand zanubrutinib-associated treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and identify treatment-limiting toxicities. Data were pooled from 6 studies (N=779). Assessments included type, incidence, severity, and outcome of TEAEs. Median age was 65 years; 20% were >/=75 years old. Most patients had Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (33%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (29%), or mantle-cell lymphoma (19%). Median treatment duration was 26 months (range: 0.1-65); 16% of patients were treated for >/=3 years. Common nonhematologic TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (URI, 39%), rash (27%), bruising (25%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), diarrhea (23%), cough, pneumonia (21% each), urinary tract infection (UTI), fatigue (15% each). Most common grade >/=3 TEAEs were pneumonia (11%), hypertension (5%), URI, UTI, sepsis, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain (2% each). Atrial fibrillation and major hemorrhage occurred in 3% and 4% of patients, respectively. Atrial fibrillation, hypertension and diarrhea occurred at lower rates than those reported historically for ibrutinib. Grade >/=3 AEs included neutropenia (23%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and anemia (8%). Serious TEAEs included pneumonia (11%), sepsis (2%), and pyrexia (2%).

Outcomes in clinical trials and population-based registries vary; potential explanations include a delay in treatment and lower adherence to guideline-recommended therapy in real-world practice. We used the Vizient Clinical Data Base to describe demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in patients newly diagnosed with APL during the study period of April 2017 to March 2020. Baseline white blood cell count was used to assign risk status and assess treatment concordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Logistic regression models examined adjusted associations between patient, hospital, disease characteristics, and adverse outcomes (in-hospital death or discharge to hospice). Among 1464 patients with APL, 205 (14.0%) experienced an adverse outcome. A substantial subset (20.6%) of patients did not receive guideline-concordant regimens. Odds of adverse outcomes increased with failure to receive guideline-concordant treatment (odds ratio [OR], 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-3.75; P = .001), high-risk disease (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.53-4.00; P < .001), and increasing age (>/=60 years: OR, 11.13; 95% CI, 4.55-27.22; P < .001). Higher hospital acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient volume was associated with lower odds of adverse outcome (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.99 [for </=50 vs >200 AML patients per year]; P = .046). In conclusion, in this large database analysis, 14.0% of patients newly diagnosed with APL died or were discharged to hospice. A substantial proportion of patients did not receive guideline-concordant therapy, potentially contributing to adverse outcomes.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

We studied the role of donor HLA mismatching in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), disease recurrence and survival after haploidentical donor transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for 1434 acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. The impact of mismatching in the graft-versus-host vector for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 alleles, the HLA-B leader, and HLA-DPB1 T-cell epitope (TCE) were studied using multivariable regression methods. Outcome was associated with HLA (mis)matches at individual loci rather than the total number of HLA mismatches. HLA-DRB1 mismatches were associated with lower risk of disease recurrence. HLA-DRB1-mismatching with HLA-DQB1-matching correlated with improved disease-free survival. HLA-B leader matching and HLA-DPB1 TCE-non-permissive mismatching were each associated with improved overall survival. HLA-C matching lowered chronic GVHD risk, and the level of HLA-C expression correlated with transplant-related mortality. Matching status at the HLA-B leader and HLA-DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1 predicted disease-free survival, as did patient and donor CMV serostatus, patient age and co-morbidity index. A web-based tool was developed to facilitate selection of the best haploidentical related donor by calculating disease-free survival based on these characteristics. In conclusion, HLA factors influence the success of haploidentical transplantation with PTCy. HLA-DRB1 and -DPB1 mismatching and HLA-C, -B leader, and -DQB1 matching are favorable. Consideration of HLA factors may help to optimize the selection of haploidentical related donors.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'McCurdy, Shannon R', 'Solomon, Scott R', 'Wang, Tao', 'Herr, Megan M', 'Modi, Dipenkumar', 'Grunwald, Michael Richard', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Kuxhausen, Michelle', 'Fingerson, Stephanie', 'McKallor, Caroline', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Kasamon, Yvette L', 'Bolon, Yung-Tsi', 'Saad, Ayman', 'McGuirk, Joseph P', 'Paczesny, Sophie', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Marsh, Steven Ge', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Petersdorf, Effie W']","['Fuchs EJ', 'McCurdy SR', 'Solomon SR', 'Wang T', 'Herr MM', 'Modi D', 'Grunwald MR', 'Nishihori T', 'Kuxhausen M', 'Fingerson S', 'McKallor C', 'Bashey A', 'Kasamon YL', 'Bolon YT', 'Saad A', 'McGuirk JP', 'Paczesny S', 'Gadalla SM', 'Marsh SG', 'Shaw BE', 'Spellman SR', 'Lee SJ', 'Petersdorf EW']","['Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Media, Pennsylvania, United States.', 'Northside Hospital Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, United States.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, United States.', 'Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, United States.', 'Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, United States.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), National Marrow Donor Program(R)/Be The Match(R), Minneapolis, MN, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), National Marrow Donor Program(R)/Be The Match(R), Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Northside Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, United States.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), National Marrow Donor Program(R)/Be The Match(R), Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.', 'The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'University of Kansas Cancer Center, Westwood, Kansas, United States.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States.', 'National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, United States.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute & UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'CIBMTR, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211101,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:00,['2021/11/01 17:24'],"['2021/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/01 17:24 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01815-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021013443 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Nov 1. pii: S0006-4971(21)01815-2. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021013443.,,,,,,,"['R01 CA100019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA218285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI069197/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2596-6843', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5768-9396', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6525-8844', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2621-7924', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2161-8259', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0003-0130', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0539-4796', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5571-2775', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3255-8143']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) MRD Working Party evaluated standardization and harmonization of MRD in an ongoing manner and has updated the 2018 ELN MRD recommendations based on significant developments in the field. New and revised recommendations were established during in-person and online meetings, and a 2-stage Delphi poll was conducted to optimize consensus. All recommendations are graded by levels of evidence and agreement. Major changes include technical specifications for next-generation sequencing-based MRD testing and integrative assessments of MRD irrespective of technology. Other topics include use of MRD as a prognostic and surrogate end point for drug testing; selection of the technique, material, and appropriate time points for MRD assessment; and clinical implications of MRD assessment. In addition to technical recommendations for flow- and molecular-MRD analysis, we provide MRD thresholds and define MRD response, and detail how MRD results should be reported and combined if several techniques are used. MRD assessment in AML is complex and clinically relevant, and standardized approaches to application, interpretation, technical conduct, and reporting are of critical importance.",['(c) 2021 by The

This addition could improve turnaround times, decrease time spent revisiting cases, and improve consistency. METHODS: We trained a machine learning classifier to use our screening B-cell panel to predict whether we should order an additional panel to distinguish chronic lymphocytic lymphoma from mantle cell lymphoma. We used data from 2016 to 2018 for training and validation, and cases were restricted to the first case per patient (9,635 cases, 887 with the additional panel). We applied the model in real time over approximately 2.5 months in 2020 to 376 sequential cases, with automated email notifications for positive predictions. RESULTS: Using 80% of the data from 2016 to 2018 to train and 20% for validation, we achieved 95% area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and 94% accuracy in the validation set. Applying the classifier in real time achieved 89% AUROC and 94% real-time prediction accuracy (precision [positive predictive value] = 51%, recall [sensitivity] = 78%, and F1 score = 0.62). Fourteen of the 17 false positives had prior diagnoses to which the algorithm was not privy.

Autophagy can protect cancer cells under chemotherapeutic stimulation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical in drug resistance of CML. The role of lncRNAs in autophagy and drug resistance of CML needs to be further explored. Methods: Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the autophagy activity in the drug-resistant CML cell line K562/G01 and its parental cell line K562. Then the sensitivity of K562/G01 cells to the first generation TKI imatinib (IM) after autophagy inhibition was determined by CCK-8 assays. The lncRNA OIP5-AS1 related to the drug resistance of CML cells was determined by Gene Expression Omnibus database analysis. Western blot and drug-sensitivity assays were used to detect changes in autophagy and sensitivity to the IM in resistant CML cells after OIP5-AS1 knockdown. The interactions of OIP5-AS1, miR-30e-5p, and ATG12 were explored by RNA immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Results: In this study, we found that autophagy was associated with drug resistance in CML cells. Moreover, the upregulation of OIP5-AS1 in K562/G01 cells was related to the enhancement of autophagy. Knockdown of OIP5-AS1 suppressed autophagy and enhanced the sensitivity of K562/G01 cells to IM. Furthermore, OIP5-AS1 regulated ATG12 by competitively binding miR-30e-5p, thereby affecting autophagy-related drug resistance. Conclusion: Our study reveals that OIP5-AS1 promotes the autophagy-related IM resistance in CML cells by regulating miR-30e-5p/ATG12 axis, providing new insights into the drug resistance mechanism of CML.",,"['Dai, Hongdan', 'Wang, Jianming', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Wang, Xin', 'Li, Qian', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Dai H', 'Wang J', 'Huang Z', 'Zhang H', 'Wang X', 'Li Q', 'Feng W']","['12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', '12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', '12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', '12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', '117972The First Affiliated Hospital, 12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', '12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', '12550Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATG12', '*LncRNA OIP5-AS1', '*autophagy', '*chemoresistance', '*chronic myeloid leukemia']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:00,['2021/11/01 16:36'],"['2021/11/01 16:36 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/15330338211052150 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jan-Dec;20:15330338211052150. doi: 10.1177/15330338211052150.,20,,15330338211052150,,,PMC8564130,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0889-8348'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34723452,,Publisher,,,1993,DDX41-Associated Familial Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: DDX41-associated familial myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) is characterized by an increased risk of myeloid neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, adult-onset single- or multiple-lineage cytopenias (including aplastic anemia), and red blood cell macrocytosis. The most common myeloid neoplasms include MDS, AML, and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms are less common. Lymphoid neoplasms include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of DDX41-associated familial MDS/AML is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in DDX41 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment: Standard neoplasm-specific therapy; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant evaluation early in the course of hematologic malignancy if appropriate based on the age of the individual, malignancy, and health status - including identification of potential related donors for genetic counseling and genotyping. Surveillance: Complete blood count with differential every six to 12 months or more frequently as clinically indicated; annual clinical examination for constitutional signs and symptoms of MDS/AML (e.g., fatigue, infections, bleeding, and skin changes). Consider bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with cytogenetics. GENETIC COUNSELING: DDX41-associated familial MDS/AML is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals diagnosed with DDX41-associated familial MDS/AML whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. The heterozygous parent may or may not have developed a hematologic malignancy. If a parent of the proband is known to have the pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the DDX41 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

The purpose of this research was the evaluation of expression level of miR-181a and -b in patients with ALL compared to the control group. Furthermore, we examined their expression level in hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) patients who developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in comparison with those without aGVHD and explore the relationship between their expression level and cytogenetic abnormalities. In this cross-sectional study, 76 newly diagnosed adult De novo ALL patients were enrolled who were admitted to our referral hospital. All patients received standard chemotherapy, consisting of daunorubicin. A total of 37 patients underwent HSCT from the related human leukocyte antigen-matched donors. ALL patients have been diagnosed with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Torque teno viruses (TTVs). We assessed the expression levels of miR-181a and -b in the peripheral blood sample of ALL patients at the time of diagnosis prior to chemotherapy, and healthy matched individuals by RT-PCR. TTVs and COVID-19 load were also determined via RT-PCR. In conclusion, the expression level of miR-181a and -b were significantly higher in ALL patients than healthy controls and also increased in patients who developed aGVHD in comparison with those without aGVHD. MiR-181a and -b can be a useful biomarker in ALL and a useful indicator of aGVHD. The expression level of miR-181a in ALL patients with COVID-19 is significantly up-regulated, while it is reduced in these patients with TTV.","['(c) The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Virological Society 2021.']","['Iravani Saadi, Mahdiyar', 'Ramzi, Mani', 'Hesami, Zahra', 'Kheradmand, Nadiya', 'Owjfard, Maryam', 'Nabi Abdolyousefi, Ehsan', 'Karimi, Zahed']","['Iravani Saadi M', 'Ramzi M', 'Hesami Z', 'Kheradmand N', 'Owjfard M', 'Nabi Abdolyousefi E', 'Karimi Z']","['Hematology Research Center and Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Hematology Research Center and Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Hematology Research Center and Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Hematology Research Center and Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Clinical Neurology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Hematology Research Center and Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Hematology Research Center and Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211025,India,Virusdisease,Virusdisease,101624144,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'COVID-19', 'MicroRNAs', 'Torque teno viruses', 'aGVHD']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:00,['2021/11/01 09:28'],"['2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:28 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13337-021-00743-x [doi]', '743 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Virusdisease. 2021 Oct 25:1-10. doi: 10.1007/s13337-021-00743-x.,,,1-10,,,PMC8543773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, cell metabolism is often disturbed in malignancies such as cancer, and targeting metabolic pathways can provide new therapeutic options. Cell metabolism is mostly studied in cell cultures in vitro, using techniques such as metabolomics, stable isotope tracing, and biochemical assays. Increasing evidence however shows that the metabolic profile of cells is highly dependent on the microenvironment, and metabolic vulnerabilities identified in vitro do not always translate to in vivo settings. Here, we provide a detailed protocol on how to perform in vivo stable isotope tracing in leukemia cells in mice, focusing on glutamine metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells.

Great strides have been made in the past three decades to understand the role of NF-kappaB in physiological and pathological conditions. Carcinogenesis is associated with constitutive activation of NF-kappaB that promotes tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis evasion. NF-kappaB is ubiquitously expressed, however, its activity is under tight regulation by inhibitors of the pathway and through multiple posttranslational modifications. O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic posttranslational modification that controls NF-kappaB-dependent transactivation. O-GlcNAcylation acts as a nutrient-dependent rheostat of cellular signaling. Increased uptake of glucose and glutamine by cancer cells enhances NF-kappaB O-GlcNAcylation. Growing evidence indicates that O-GlcNAcylation of NF-kappaB is a key molecular mechanism that regulates cancer cell proliferation, survival and metastasis and acts as link between inflammation and cancer. In this review, we are attempting to summarize the current understanding of the cohesive role of NF-kappaB O-GlcNAcylation in inflammation and cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu and Ramakrishnan.'],"['Liu, Angela Rose', 'Ramakrishnan, Parameswaran']","['Liu AR', 'Ramakrishnan P']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211015,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB)', 'O-GlcNAcylation', 'cancer', 'hexosamine biosynthetic pathway', 'inflammation', 'leukemia', 'posttranslational modifications (PTMs)']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:26'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:26 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.751761 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 15;9:751761. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.751761. eCollection 2021.,9,,751761,,,PMC8555427,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression patterns and prognostic roles of these genes in pan-cancer are still largely unclear. The expression patterns and prognostic roles of SLC7A11, GPX4, and AIFM2 and the relationships between the expression levels of these genes and immune infiltration levels in pan-cancer were analyzed by using TIMER, gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA), Oncomine, and Kaplan-Meier databases. Our results showed that both SLC7A11 and GPX4 were overexpressed in colorectal cancer, and SLC7A11 was overexpressed in lung cancer. High levels of SLC7A11 and AIFM2 were significantly linked with the shortened disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), respectively. And high expression of SLC7A11, GPX4, and AIFM2 were significantly correlated with the shortened OS of acute myeloid leukemia patients. In esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), GPX4 expression was significantly associated with the infiltration of macrophage and myeloid dendritic cell, and AIFM2 expression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD4(+) T cell. Importantly, GPX4 expression was positively correlated with the expression levels of monocyte markers (CD14 and CD115) and M2 macrophage markers (VSIG4 and MS4A4A) both in ESCA and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). In summary, SLC7A11, GPX4, and AIFM2 are dysregulated in many types of cancers, and are candidate prognostic biomarkers for many types of cancers, and can be used to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells in tumor tissues.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Shi, Tao, Fan, Song and Bai.']","['Shi, Zhi-Zhou', 'Tao, Hao', 'Fan, Ze-Wen', 'Song, Sheng-Jie', 'Bai, Jie']","['Shi ZZ', 'Tao H', 'Fan ZW', 'Song SJ', 'Bai J']","['Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211013,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['AIFM2', 'GPX4', 'SLC7A11', 'ferroptosis', 'pan-cancer']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:26'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:26 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.748925 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 13;9:748925. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.748925. eCollection 2021.,9,,748925,,,PMC8548644,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our knowledge of MAE during hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis is limited. In this study, we conducted a systematic interrogation of MAEs in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) at single-cell resolution to construct a MAE atlas of BMMCs. We identified 1,020 constitutive MAEs in BMMCs, which included imprinted genes such as MEG8, NAP1L5, and IRAIN. We classified the BMMCs into six cell types and identified 74 cell type specific MAEs including MTSS1, MOB1A, and TCF12. We further identified 114 random MAEs (rMAEs) at single-cell level, with 78.1% single-allele rMAE and 21.9% biallelic mosaic rMAE. Many MAEs identified in BMMCs have not been reported and are potentially hematopoietic specific, supporting MAEs are functional relevance. Comparison of BMMC samples from a leukemia patient with multiple clinical stages showed the fractions of constitutive MAE were correlated with fractions of leukemia cells in BMMCs. Further separation of the BMMCs into leukemia cells and normal cells showed that leukemia cells have much higher constitutive MAE and rMAEs than normal cells. We identified the leukemia cell-specific MAEs and relapsed leukemia cell-specific MAEs, which were enriched in immune-related functions. These results indicate MAE is prevalent and is an important gene regulation mechanism during hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. As the first systematical interrogation of constitutive MAEs, cell type specific MAEs, and rMAEs during hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, the study significantly increased our knowledge about the features and functions of MAEs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Fu, Qin, Zou, Hu, Hong, Wang and Jin.']","['Fu, Ruiqing', 'Qin, Pengfei', 'Zou, Xianghui', 'Hu, Zhangli', 'Hong, Ni', 'Wang, Yun', 'Jin, Wenfei']","['Fu R', 'Qin P', 'Zou X', 'Hu Z', 'Hong N', 'Wang Y', 'Jin W']","['Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Microbiology and Gene Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'School of Food Engineering and Biotechnology, Hanshan Normal University, Chaozhou, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Systems Biology, School of Life Sciences, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'School of Food Engineering and Biotechnology, Hanshan Normal University, Chaozhou, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Microbiology and Gene Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Systems Biology, School of Life Sciences, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Microbiology and Gene Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Systems Biology, School of Life Sciences, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211013,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow mononuclear cells', 'constitutive monoallelic expression', 'leukemia', 'random monoallelic expression', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:25'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:25 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.702897 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 13;9:702897. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.702897. eCollection 2021.,9,,702897,,,PMC8548578,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of T-cell replete HLA haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (TCR-haplo-HSCT) for pediatric refractory/relapsed BCP-ALL (RR-BCP-ALL). Methods: Nineteen pediatric patients with RR-BCP-ALL underwent TCR-haplo-HSCT between 2010 and 2019 at the Fukushima Medical University Hospital. The disease status at TCR-haplo-HSCT included complete remission (CR) in eight patients and non-CR with active disease in 11 patients. Total body irradiation-based, busulfan-based, and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens were employed in 11, 6, and 2 patients, respectively. Low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin, 2.5 mg/kg) was used in all patients. Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and prednisolone. Results: All patients received peripheral blood stem cells as the stem cell source. The HLA disparities in graft vs. host directions were 2/8 in one, 3/8 in five, and 4/8 in 13 patients. Among 18 patients who achieved primary engraftment, acute GVHD occurred in all 18 evaluable patients (grade II, 9; grade III, 8; grade IV, 1), and chronic GVHD was observed in 10 out of 15 evaluable patients. Three patients died because of transplant-related mortality. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival rates were 57.4 and 42.1%, respectively. Compared to patients older than 10 years in age (N = 10), those younger than 10 years in age (N = 9) showed an excellent OS rate (3-year OS rate: patients < 10 years old, 100%; patients > 10 years old, 20% [95% confidence interval, 3.1-47.5]; p = 0.002). Conclusions: We suggest that TCR haplo-HSCT with low-dose ATG conditioning has the potential to improve the transplantation outcomes in patients with RR-BCP.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sano, Mochizuki, Kobayashi, Ohara, Takahashi, Kudo, Waragai,', 'Ikeda, Ohto and Kikuta.']","['Sano, Hideki', 'Mochizuki, Kazuhiro', 'Kobayashi, Shogo', 'Ohara, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Nobuhisa', 'Kudo, Shingo', 'Waragai, Tomoko', 'Ikeda, Kazuhiko', 'Ohto, Hitoshi', 'Kikuta, Atsushi']","['Sano H', 'Mochizuki K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Ohara Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Kudo S', 'Waragai T', 'Ikeda K', 'Ohto H', 'Kikuta A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211013,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)', 'graft versus leukaemia effect', 'graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)', 'haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:25'],"['2021/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:25 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.743294 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Oct 13;9:743294. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.743294. eCollection 2021.,9,,743294,,,PMC8549544,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of patients non-responsive to front line treatment with steroids have an estimated overall 2-year survival rate of only 10%. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins influence inflammatory gene transcription, and therefore represent a potential target to mitigate inflammation central to acute GVHD pathogenesis. Using potent and selective BET inhibitors Plexxikon-51107 and -2853 (PLX51107 and PLX2853), we show that BET inhibition significantly improves survival and reduces disease progression in murine models of acute GVHD without sacrificing the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia response. BET inhibition reduces T cell alloreactive proliferation, decreases inflammatory cytokine production, and impairs dendritic cell maturation both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing studies in human T cells revealed that BET inhibition impacts inflammatory IL-17 and IL-12 gene expression signatures, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing revealed that BRD4 binds directly to the IL-23R gene locus. BET inhibition results in decreased IL-23R expression and function as demonstrated by decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to IL-23 stimulation in human T cells in vitro as well as in mouse donor T cells in vivo. Furthermore, PLX2853 significantly reduced IL-23R+ and pathogenic CD4+ IFNgamma+ IL-17+ double positive T cell infiltration in gastrointestinal tissues in an acute GVHD murine model. Our findings identify a role for BET proteins in regulating the IL-23R/STAT3/IL-17 pathway. Based on our preclinical data presented here, PLX51107 will enter clinical trial for refractory acute GVHD in a Phase 1 safety, biological efficacy trial.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Snyder, Choe, Gao, Sell, Braunreiter, Zitzer,', 'Neidemire-Colley, Kalyan, Dorrance, Keller, Mihaylova, Singh, Sehgal, Bollag, Ma,', 'Powell, Devine and Ranganathan.']","['Snyder, Katiri J', 'Choe, Hannah K', 'Gao, Yandi', 'Sell, Natalie E', 'Braunreiter, Kara M', 'Zitzer, Nina C', 'Neidemire-Colley, Lotus', 'Kalyan, Sonu', 'Dorrance, Adrienne M', 'Keller, Andrea', 'Mihaylova, Maria M', 'Singh, Satishkumar', 'Sehgal, Lalit', 'Bollag, Gideon', 'Ma, Yan', 'Powell, Ben', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Ranganathan, Parvathi']","['Snyder KJ', 'Choe HK', 'Gao Y', 'Sell NE', 'Braunreiter KM', 'Zitzer NC', 'Neidemire-Colley L', 'Kalyan S', 'Dorrance AM', 'Keller A', 'Mihaylova MM', 'Singh S', 'Sehgal L', 'Bollag G', 'Ma Y', 'Powell B', 'Devine SM', 'Ranganathan P']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Columbus, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Columbus, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Plexxikon Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States.', 'Plexxikon Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States.', 'Plexxikon Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BET (Bromodomain and extra-terminal) inhibitor', 'GVHD', 'GVHD biology', 'IL-23R', 'T cells']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:24'],"['2021/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:24 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.760789 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 15;11:760789. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.760789. eCollection 2021.,11,,760789,,,PMC8554203,['T32 GM086252/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['GB, YM, and BP are employees of Plexxikon Inc.

Methods: We carried out a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial. Totally of 25 patients were enrolled, including 17 AML patients and 8 MDS patients. Each patient received four courses of non-ablative chemotherapy, with HLA-mismatched donor CD3(+) allo-TLI 24 h after each course. AML patients received chemotherapy with decitabine, idarubicin, and cytarabine, and MDS patients received decitabine, cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Results: A total of 79 procedures were performed. The overall response rates of the AML and MDS patients were 94% and 75% and the 1-year overall survival rates were 88% (61-97%) and 60% (13-88%), respectively. The overall 60-day treatment-related mortality was 8%. Compared with a historical control cohort that received idarubicin plus cytarabine (3 + 7), the study group showed significantly better overall response (94% vs. 50%, P=0.002) and overall survival rates (the 1-year OS rate was 88% vs. 27%, P=0.014). Post-TLI cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) occurred after 79% of allo-TLI operations, and 96% of CRS reactions were grade 1. Conclusion: Elderly AML patients and intermediate-2 to high-risk MDS patients are usually insensitive to or cannot tolerate regular chemotherapies, and may not have the opportunity to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our study showed that non-ablative chemotherapy followed by HLA-mismatched allo-TLI is safe and effective, and may thus be used as a first-line treatment for these patients.

Genetic and epigenetic abnormalities are driving factors for leukemogenesis. RUNX1 and RUNX2 from the Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family played important roles in AML pathogenesis. However, the relationship between RUNX3 and AML remains unclear. Here, we found that RUNX3 was a super-enhancer-associated gene and highly expressed in AML cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed high expression of RUNX3 correlated with poor prognosis of AML patients. We observed that Runx3 knockdown significantly inhibited leukemia progression by inducing DNA damage to enhance apoptosis in murine AML cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis, we discovered that RUNX3 in AML cells mainly bound more genes involved in DNA-damage repair and antiapoptosis pathways compared to that in normal bone marrow cells. Runx3 knockdown obviously inhibited the expression of these genes in AML cells. Overall, we identified RUNX3 as an oncogene overexpressed in AML cells, and Runx3 knockdown suppressed AML progression by inducing DNA damage and apoptosis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Ma, Long, Sun, Liu, Lin and Zhao.']","['Zhang, Wenwen', 'Ma, Qian', 'Long, Bing', 'Sun, Zhangyi', 'Liu, Lingling', 'Lin, Dongjun', 'Zhao, Minyi']","['Zhang W', 'Ma Q', 'Long B', 'Sun Z', 'Liu L', 'Lin D', 'Zhao M']","['Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211012,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'RUNX3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'super-enhancer']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:24'],"['2021/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:24 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.725336 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 12;11:725336. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.725336. eCollection 2021.,11,,725336,,,PMC8549545,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case-control study investigated the association of GST gene polymorphisms with the etiology and therapeutic outcome of B-ALL among Kashmiri population. Methods: A total of 300 individuals including 150 newly diagnosed B-ALL patients and an equal number of age and gender matched controls were genotyped for five GST gene polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique (PCR-RFLP) and multiplex PCR techniques. Results: Higher frequency of GSTT1 null, GSTO2-AG, and GSTO2-GG genotypes was observed in ALL cases compared to controls that associated significantly with ALL risk (GSTT1 null: OR = 2.93, p = 0.0001; GSTO2-AG: OR = 2.58, p = 0.01; GSTO2-GG: OR = 3.13, p = 0.01). GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTO1 SNPs showed no significant association (p > 0.05). Combined genotype analysis revealed significant association of GSTT1 null/GSTM1 null (OR = 4.11, p = 0.011) and GSTT1 null/GSTP1-AG (OR = 4.93, p = 0.0003) with B-ALL susceptibility. Haplotype analysis of rs4925 and rs156697 revealed that carriers of CG haplotype had increased risk of B-ALL (p = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier plots revealed significantly inferior 3-year disease-free survival for GSTO2-GG carriers (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis confirmed GSTO2-GG as an independent poor prognostic factor for DFS (HR = 4.5, p = 0.034). Among combined genotypes, only GSTT1 null/GSTP1-AG associated significantly with poorer DFS rates (p = 0.032). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that GSTT1 null individually or in combination with GSTM1null and GSTP1-AG genotypes associated with increased B-ALL risk. Also, rs156697 variant genotypes (AG and GG) associated with B-ALL, whereas the GG genotype of rs156697 influenced the treatment outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Baba, Pandith, Shah, Geelani, Bhat, Gul, Guru, El-Serehy, Koul', 'and Mansoor.']","['Baba, Shahid M', 'Pandith, Arshad A', 'Shah, Zafar A', 'Geelani, Sajad A', 'Bhat, Javid R', 'Gul, Ayaz', 'Guru, Sameer A', 'El-Serehy, Hamed A', 'Koul, Abid M', 'Mansoor, Sheikh']","['Baba SM', 'Pandith AA', 'Shah ZA', 'Geelani SA', 'Bhat JR', 'Gul A', 'Guru SA', 'El-Serehy HA', 'Koul AM', 'Mansoor S']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, SKIMS, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, SKIMS, Srinagar, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, SKIMS, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, India.', ""Department of Developmental and System Biology, Lurie Children's Hospital Northwest University, Chicago, IL, United States."", 'Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, SKIMS, Srinagar, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, SKIMS, Srinagar, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211014,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['GSTO1', 'GSTO2', 'Kashmir', 'PCR-RFLP', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'glutathione S-transferase', 'polymorphism', 'survival analysis']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:24'],"['2021/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:24 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.714421 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 14;11:714421. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.714421. eCollection 2021.,11,,714421,,,PMC8552530,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parallel to this remarkable improvement, there has been mounting interest in the long-term health of the survivors. Consequently, modified treatment protocols have been developed and resulted in the reduction of many adverse long-term consequences. Nevertheless, these are still substantial concerns that warrant further mitigation efforts. In the current review, pediatric-ALL survivors' late adverse events, including secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs), cardiac toxicity, neurotoxicity, bone toxicity, hepatic dysfunction, visual changes, obesity, impact on fertility, and neurocognitive effects have been evaluated. Throughout this review, we attempted to answer a fundamental question: can the recent molecular findings mitigate pediatric-ALL chemotherapy's long-term sequelae on adult survivors? For SMNs, few genetic predisposition factors have been identified including TP53 and POT1 variants. Other treatment-related risk factors have been identified such as anthracyclines' possible association with breast cancer in female survivors. Cardiotoxicity is another significant and common adverse event with some germline variants been found, albeit with conflicting evidence, to increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. For peripheral neurotoxicity, vincristine is the primary neurotoxic agent in ALL regimens. Some germline genetic variants were found to be associated with the vincristine neurotoxic effect's vulnerability. However, these were mainly detected with acute neuropathy. Moreover, the high steroid doses and prolonged use increase bone toxicity and obesity risk with some pharmacogenetic biomarkers were associated with increased steroid sensitivity. Therefore, the role of these biomarkers in tailoring steroid choice and dose is a promising research area. Future directions in pediatric ALL treatment should consider the various opportunities provided by genomic medicine. Understanding the molecular bases underlying toxicities will classify patients into risk groups and implement a closer follow-up to those at higher risk. Pharmacogenetic-guided dosing and selecting between alternative agents have proven their efficacy in the short-term management of childhood ALL. It is the right time to think about a similar approach for the life-long consequences on survivors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Al-Mahayri, AlAhmad and Ali.']","['Al-Mahayri, Zeina N', 'AlAhmad, Mohammad M', 'Ali, Bassam R']","['Al-Mahayri ZN', 'AlAhmad MM', 'Ali BR']","['Department of Genetics and Genomics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Al-Ain University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Genetics and Genomics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Zayed Center for Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211015,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer survivors', 'cardiotoxicity', 'long-term chemotherapy adverse events', 'neurotoxicity', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'secondary tumors']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:24'],"['2021/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:24 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.710163 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 15;11:710163. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.710163. eCollection 2021.,11,,710163,,,PMC8554193,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While complete remission can be obtained with intensive chemotherapy in young and fit patients, relapse is frequent and prognosis remains poor. Leukemic cells are thought to arise from a pool of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) which sit at the top of the hierarchy. Since their discovery, more than 30 years ago, LSCs have been a topic of intense research and their identification paved the way for cancer stem cell research. LSCs are defined by their ability to self-renew, to engraft into recipient mice and to give rise to leukemia. Compared to healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), LSCs display specific mutations, epigenetic modifications, and a specific metabolic profile. LSCs are usually considered resistant to chemotherapy and are therefore the drivers of relapse. Similar to their HSC counterpart, LSCs reside in a highly specialized microenvironment referred to as the ""niche"". Bidirectional interactions between leukemic cells and the microenvironment favor leukemic progression at the expense of healthy hematopoiesis. Within the niche, LSCs are thought to be protected from genotoxic insults. Improvement in our understanding of LSC gene expression profile and phenotype has led to the development of prognosis signatures and the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

Some FLT3 kinase inhibitors are dual kinase inhibitors that inhibit the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptor tyrosine kinase family and are used to treat solid cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). AXL promotes metastasis, suppression of immune response, and drug resistance in NSCLC and TNBC. G-749, a potential TAM receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and its derivative SKI-G-801, effectively inhibits the phosphorylation of AXL at nanomolar concentration (IC50 = 20 nM). This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of G-749 targeting the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase in colon cancer. Here, we demonstrate the potential of G-749 to effectively inhibit tumorigenesis by degrading TYRO3 via regulated intramembrane proteolysis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that G-749 inhibits the signaling pathway associated with cell proliferation in colon cancer cell lines HCT15 and SW620, as well as tumor xenograft mouse models. We propose G-749 as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of colon cancer caused by abnormal TYRO3 expression or activity.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kim, Park, Choi, Song, Hoe and Kim.']","['Kim, Hae Dong', 'Park, Eun Jung', 'Choi, Eun Kyoung', 'Song, Seuk Young', 'Hoe, Kwang-Lae', 'Kim, Dong-Uk']","['Kim HD', 'Park EJ', 'Choi EK', 'Song SY', 'Hoe KL', 'Kim DU']","['Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Department of New Drug Development, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Application Strategy and Development Division, GeneChem Inc., Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Department of New Drug Development, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211014,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['G-749', 'RIP process', 'TAM receptor tyrosine kinase', 'anticancer drug', 'protein degradation', 'tyro3']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 09:09'],"['2021/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/01 09:09 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.730241 [doi]', '730241 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Oct 14;12:730241. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.730241. eCollection 2021.,12,,730241,,,PMC8551583,,"['EP was employed by GeneChem Inc.

The mass is composed of primitive myeloid cells that can occur in a variety of organs, most commonly the skin, lymph nodes, GI tract, bone, breast, and CNS. Involvement of the genitourinary tract is rare. Consensus on treatment of MS has not been established, but management typically involves systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as palliative local therapies such as radiation or surgery. Outcomes of MS using novel AML therapies, such as BCL-2 inhibitors or IDH inhibitors, remain undescribed. We describe a rare case of a 70-year-old man presenting with MS of the urinary bladder complicating known secondary AML (RUNX1 and IDH2 mutated). Prior to development of bladder MS, the patient had received decitabine, enasidenib, and venetoclax. Following diagnosis, he was treated with cytarabine and venetoclax.

The identification of biomarkers able to prevent and/or monitor these adverse reactions would be useful for clinicians for the proactive management of long-term thiopurine therapy.

At the same time, there is interest in enhancing the functionality of these cells via surface decoration with nanoparticles (backpacking). Magnetic nanoparticle cell labeling is of particular interest due to opportunities for magnetic separation, in vivo manipulation, drug delivery and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While modification of T cells with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was explored before, we questioned whether MNPs are compatible with CAR-T cells when introduced during the manufacturing process. We chose highly aminated 120 nm crosslinked iron oxide nanoworms (CLIO NWs, ~36,000 amines per NW) that could efficiently label different adherent cell lines and we used CD123 CAR-T cells as the labeling model. The CD123 CAR-T cells were produced in the presence of CLIO NWs, CLIO NWs plus protamine sulfate (PS), or PS only. The transduction efficiency of lentiviral CD123 CAR with only NWs was ~23% lower than NW+PS and PS groups (~33% and 35%, respectively). The cell viability from these three transduction conditions was not reduced within CAR-T cell groups, though lower compared to non-transduced T cells (mock T). Use of CLIO NWs instead of, or together with cationic protamine sulfate for enhancement of lentiviral transduction resulted in comparable levels of CAR expression and viability but decreased the proportion of CD8+ cells and increased the proportion of CD4+ cells. CD123 CAR-T transduced in the presence of CLIO NWs, CLIO NWs plus PS, or PS only, showed similar level of cytotoxicity against leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy imaging demonstrated that CD123 CAR-T cells labeled with CLIO NW formed rosettes with CD123+ leukemic cells as the non-labeled CAR-T cells, indicating that the CAR-T targeting to tumor cells has maintained after CLIO NW labeling. The in vivo trafficking of the NW labeled CAR-T cells showed the accumulation of CAR-T labeled with NWs primarily in the bone marrow and spleen. CAR-T cells can be magnetically labeled during their production while maintaining functionality using the positively charged iron oxide NWs, which enable the in vivo biodistribution and tracking of CAR-T cells.",,"['Zhang, Wei', 'Gaikwad, Hanmant', 'Groman, Ernest V', 'Purev, Enkhtsetseg', 'Simberg, Dmitri', 'Wang, Guankui']","['Zhang W', 'Gaikwad H', 'Groman EV', 'Purev E', 'Simberg D', 'Wang G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Translational Bio-Nanosciences Laboratory, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Colorado Center for Nanomedicine and Nanosafety, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Translational Bio-Nanosciences Laboratory, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Colorado Center for Nanomedicine and Nanosafety, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Translational Bio-Nanosciences Laboratory, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Colorado Center for Nanomedicine and Nanosafety, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Translational Bio-Nanosciences Laboratory, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Colorado Center for Nanomedicine and Nanosafety, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210829,Netherlands,J Magn Magn Mater,Journal of magnetism and magnetic materials,101314425,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T', 'cell trafficking', 'iron oxide', 'leukemia', 'magnetic labeling', 'nanoworm']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:01,['2021/11/01 08:55'],"['2023/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/11/01 08:55 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.jmmm.2021.168480 [doi]'],ppublish,J Magn Magn Mater. 2022 Jan 1;541. doi: 10.1016/j.jmmm.2021.168480.

Bortezomib prevents protein degradation, including RelA via the intracellular NF-kB pathway. In this study, we hypothesized that subgroups of pediatric AML patients benefitting from standard therapy plus bortezomib (ADEB) could be identified based on pre-treatment RelA expression and phosphorylation status. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RelA-total and phosphorylation at serine 536 (RelA-pSer(536) ) were measured in 483 patient samples using reverse phase protein array technology. RESULTS: In ADEB-treated patients, low-RelA-pSer(536) was favorably prognostic when compared to high-RelA-pSer(536) (3-yr overall survival (OS): 81% vs. 68%, p = 0.032; relapse risk (RR): 30% vs. 49%, p = 0.004). Among low-RelA-pSer(536) patients, RR significantly decreased with ADEB compared to ADE (RR: 30% vs. 44%, p = 0.035). Correlation between RelA-pSer(536) and 295 other assayed proteins identified a strong correlation with HSF1-pSer(326) , another protein previously identified as modifying ADEB response. The combination of low-RelA-pSer(536) and low-HSF1-pSer(326) was a significant predictor of ADEB response (3-yr OS: 86% vs. 67%, p = 0.013).

Tyk2 associates with interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23 receptors and mediates their downstream signaling pathways. Based on our data using Tyk2-deficient mice and cells, Tyk2 plays crucial roles in the differentiation, maintenance, and function of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, and its dysregulation may promote autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. IFN-alpha-induced growth inhibition of B lymphocyte progenitors is dependent on Tyk2-mediated signals to regulate death-associated protein (Daxx) nuclear localization and Daxx-promyelocytic leukemia protein interactions. Tyk2-deficient mice show impaired constitutive production of type I IFNs by macrophages under steady-state conditions. When heat-killed Cutibacterium acnes is injected intraperitoneally, Tyk2-deficient mice show less granuloma formation through enhanced prostaglandin E2 and protein kinase A activities, leading to high IL-10 production by macrophages. Thus, Tyk2 is widely involved in the immune and inflammatory response at multiple events; therefore, Tyk2 is likely to be a suitable target for treating patients with autoimmune and/or chronic inflammatory diseases. Clinical trials of Tyk2 inhibitors have shown higher response rates and improved tolerability in the treatment of patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Taken together, Tyk2 inhibition has great potential for clinical application in the management of a variety of diseases.",,"['Muromoto, Ryuta', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Matsuda, Tadashi']","['Muromoto R', 'Shimoda K', 'Oritani K', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Department of Hematology, International University of Health and Welfare.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Hokkaido University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Janus family of protein tyrosine kinase (Jak) inhibitor', 'cytokine', 'immune system', 'signal transduction', 'therapy', 'tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2)']",2021/11/02 06:00,2021/11/02 06:00,['2021/11/01 05:59'],"['2021/11/01 05:59 [entrez]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/bpb.b21-00609 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2021;44(11):1585-1592. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b21-00609.,44,11,1585-1592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic value of the mentioned cytokines as biomarkers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient's remains to be identified. Therefore; this study was designed in order to address the relation between CXCL-13 concentrations levels and markers of severity in CLL patients. METHODS: Our study included 150 CLL patients and 20 controls. Serum CXCL-13 was determined by ELISA for CLL patients at diagnosis as well as controls. RESULTS: The serum CXCL-13 levels were significantly higher in CLL patients as compared to controls. The high CXCL-13 concentration levels was significantly associated with high number of smudge cells; high LDH; high grade of Rai stage, short time to first treatment (TTT). Cox regression analysis was conducted for prediction of TTT, using age, gender, WBCs, smudge cells, CXCL-13, LDH, ZAP70, CD38, beta2-microglobulin, Rai staging as covariates. High LDH, CXCL-13 and CD38% were significantly independent predictor for shorter TTT.

METHODS: A total of 132 children with ALL (ALL group) and 80 healthy children (healthy control group) were prospectively selected in this study. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression levels of serum miR-922 and miR-506 in both groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to analyze the diagnostic value of miR-922 and miR-506 for childhood ALL. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves, and multivariate COX regression models were used to analyze the risk factors for poor prognosis in children with ALL. RESULTS: The ALL group had significantly higher expression levels of serum miR-922 and miR-506 than the control group (P<0.001). The ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off values of miR-922 and miR-506 for the diagnosis of childhood ALL were 1.46 and 2.17, respectively. The high miR-922 expression (>/=1.46) group and high miR-506 expression (>/=2.17) group had significantly higher incidence rates of lymph node enlargement, leukocyte count >/=50x10(9)/L, medium-high risk stratification, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement, and karyotype abnormality than the low miR-922 expression group and low miR-506 expression group (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high expression of miR-922 and miR-506 was associated with short survival time in children with ALL (P<0.05). The multivariate COX regression analysis showed that leukocyte count >/=50x10(9)/L, medium-high risk stratification, MLL gene rearrangement, miR-922>/=1.46, and miR-506>/=2.17 could indicate poor prognosis in children with ALL (P<0.05).

Deviations of epigenetic age from chronological age are informative of health status and are associated with adverse health outcomes, including mortality. In most cases, epigenetic clocks are performed on methylation from DNA extracted from circulating blood cells. However, the effect of neoplastic cells in the circulation on estimation and interpretation of epigenetic clocks is not well understood. Here, we explored this using Fischer 344 (F344) rats, a strain that often develops large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL). We found clear histological markers of LGL pathology in the spleens and livers of 27 out of 61 rats aged 17-27 months. We assessed DNA methylation by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing with coverage of 3 million cytosine residues. Although LGL broadly increased DNA methylation variability, it did not change epigenetic aging. Despite this, inclusion of rats with LGL in clock training sets significantly altered predictor selection probability at 83 of 121 commonly utilized CpGs. Furthermore, models trained on rat samples that included individuals with LGL had greater absolute age error than those trained exclusively on LGL-free rats (39% increase; p<0.0001). We conclude that the epigenetic signals for aging and LGL are distinct, such that LGL assessment is not necessary for valid measures of epigenetic age in F344 rats. The precision and architecture of constructed epigenetic clock formulas, however, can be influenced by the presence of neoplastic hematopoietic cells in training set populations.","['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of', 'America 2021.

Asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) is a severe complication of L-Asp related to the dosage. We investigated the incidence of, and risk factors for, AAP in pediatric patients with ALL. METHODS: From January 2002 to December 2018, pediatric patients with ALL treated at National Taiwan University Hospital were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of AAP was based on the criteria of the Ponte di Legno Toxicity Working Group. RESULTS: Of the 353 patients enrolled in this study, 14 (4.0%) developed AAP. The incidence of AAP in ALL patients was significantly higher after treatment with the 2013 protocol compared with the 2002 protocol of the Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group (9.5% vs. 1.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that a high peak L-Asp dose intensity (>45,000 U/m(2)/month) and older age at diagnosis (>6.8 years) were independently predictive of AAP development. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of acute pancreatitis in childhood ALL was correlated more strongly with the peak dose intensity than with the cumulative dose of L-Asp. These results could be used to reduce the treatment-related complications of ALL. IMPACT: L-Asparaginase is an important therapeutic for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the accumulated dosage of L-asparaginase is considered as a major risk factor of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis. This article demonstrated that the incidence of pancreatitis correlates with the dose-intensity of L-asparaginase, but not the accumulated dosage. Identification of patient group with high risk of pancreatitis could lead to early diagnosis and reduce the complication. This finding could aid in developing further new protocol or therapeutic strategy design to reduce treatment-related complications and improve clinical outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['(c) 2021.

A retrospective analysis from the EBMT.,10.1038/s41409-021-01502-8 [doi],"Risk assessment of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is hindered by the lack of current data on comorbidities and outcome. The EBMT identified 38,760 allo-HCT recipients with hematologic malignancies transplanted between 2010 and 2018 from matched sibling and unrelated donors with a full data set of pre-existing comorbidities. Multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional-hazards model including known risk factors for non-relapse mortality (NRM) were performed. We found that pre-existing renal comorbidity had the strongest association with NRM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.85 [95% CI 1.55-2.19]). In addition, the association of multiple pre-existing comorbidities with NRM was significant, including diabetes, infections, cardiac comorbidity, and pulmonary comorbidity. However, the HR of the association of these comorbidities with NRM was relatively low and did not exceed 1.24. Consequently, the risk of NRM was only moderately increased in patients with a high hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) >/= 3 (HR 1.34 [1.26-1.42]). In the current EBMT population, pre-existing non-renal comorbidities determined NRM after allo-HCT to a much lesser extent as compared with the underlying HCT-CI data. Improvements in management and supportive care as well as higher awareness based on the use of HCT-CI may have contributed to this favorable development.",['(c) 2021.

While the increased risk of hematological malignancies is well-known, data on the comparative incidence of solid neoplasms is conflicting. This study aimed to explore the associations between cancer and pSS. This nationwide population-based retrospective study from the French health insurance database (PMSI) evaluated patients hospitalized with new-onset pSS from 2011 to 2018 against age- and sex-matched hospitalized controls (1:10). The incidence of hematological malignancies and solid neoplasms was compared between the two groups. Mortality and multiple cancer incidence were also evaluated. Adjusted Hazard Ratios (aHR) calculations included confounding factors, such as low socioeconomic status. Among 25,661 hospitalized patients with pSS versus 252,543 matched patients (median follow-up of 3.96 years), we observed a higher incidence rate of lymphomas (aHR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.59-2.43]), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (aHR, 10.8 [6.5-18.0]), and leukemia (aHR, 1.61 [1.1-2.4]). Thyroid cancer incidence was higher (aHR, 1.7 [1.1-2.8]), whereas bladder and breast cancer incidences were lower (aHR, 0.58 [0.37-0.89] and 0.60 [0.49-0.74], respectively). pSS patients with breast cancer exhibited a lower mortality rate. A limitation was that the database only encompasses hospitalized patients, and immunological and histological details are not listed. We confirmed the increased risk of hematological malignancies and thyroid cancers among patients with pSS. The lower risk of breast cancer suggests a role of hormonal factors and raises questions of the concept of immune surveillance within breast tissue. Epidemiological and translational studies are required to elucidate the relationships between pSS and cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the prevalence and treatment outcome in TP53 mutated AML/MDS patients in Asian population are scarce. We therefore conducted this study to analyze the prevalence and the treatment outcomes of TP53 mutation in AML and MDS-EB patients. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML and MDS-EB were recruited, extraction of deoxyribonucleic acid from bone marrow samples were done and then performing TP53 mutation analysis, using MassArray(R) System (Agena Bioscience, CA, USA). RESULTS: A total of 132 AML/MDS patients were recruited, patients with de novo AML, secondary AML, MDS-EB1, MDS-EB2 and T-AML/MDS were seen in 66, 13, 9, 9 and 3%, respectively. TP53 mutation was found in 14 patients (10.6%), and prevalence of TP53 mutation in T-AML/MDS, secondary AML, de novo AML and MDS-EB patients were 50, 17.6, 9.2 and 8%, respectively. Three patients had double heterozygous TP53 mutation. Mutated TP53 was significantly detected in patients with monosomy and complex chromosome. Common TP53 mutation were R290C, T220C, A249S and V31I which V31I mutation was reported only in Taiwanese patients. Most variant allele frequency (VAF) of TP53 mutation in the study were greater than 40%. Three year-overall survival (OS) in the whole population was 22%, 3y-OS in AML and MDS-EB patients were 22 and 27%, respectively. The 1y-OS in patients with TP53-mutant AML/MDS were shorter than that in TP53 wild-type patients, 14% versus 50%, P = 0.001. In multivariate analysis, factors affecting OS in 132 AML/MDS patients was mutant TP53 (P = 0.023, HR = 1.20-7.02), whereas, WBC count> 100,000/muL (P = 0.004, HR = 1.32-4.16) and complex karyotype (P = 0.038, HR = 1.07-9.78) were associated with shorter OS in AML patients. DISCUSSION: In this study, the prevalence of TP53 mutation in de novo AML and MDS-EB patients were low but it had impact on survival. Patients with monosomy or complex karyotype had more frequent TP53 mutation.",['(c) 2021.

LncRNAs are non-protein-coding RNAs of more than 200 nucleotides in length. Multiple studies have been published on the relationship between lncRNA expression and the progression of human diseases. LncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 4 (SNHG4), a member of the lncRNA SNHG family, is abnormally expressed in a variety of human diseases, including gastric cancer, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma, cervical cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, neonatal pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathic pain, acute cerebral infarction, acute myeloid leukaemia, and endometriosis. In this paper, the structure of SNHG4 is first introduced, and then studies in humans, animal models and cells are summarized to highlight the expression and function of SNHG4 in the above diseases. In addition, the specific mechanism of SNHG4 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) is discussed. The findings indicate that SNHG4 can be used as a biomarker for disease prognosis evaluation and as a potential target for disease diagnosis and treatment.",['(c) 2021.

The response to vaccination is highly limited in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Less than half of the patients develop antibody response, suggesting that they remain at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection even after the vaccination. Reasons for inadequate response to COVID-19 vaccination in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are multifactorial and attributed to disease-related immune dysregulation and patient- and therapy-related factors. The negative predictors of response to vaccination include hypogammaglobulinemia, advanced age, current active treatment, and past treatment anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Despite using booster doses and heterologous immunization to improve humoral and cellular immunity, some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia will fail to respond. Active treatment at the time of vaccination and a recent history of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies use are the strongest predictors of the non-response. Current data support informing patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies about the risk of infection regardless of vaccination. These individuals and members of their households should continue extreme preventive actions despite relaxed local regulations.

Here, we analyzed the tumor immune environment in pediatric B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia by analyzing serial bone marrow samples from nine patients with primary and recurrent disease by mass cytometry using 39 immunophenotype markers, and transcriptome analysis. High-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry analysis elucidated a dynamic shift of T cells from naive to effector subsets, and clarified that, during relapse, the tumor immune environment comprised a T helper 1-polarized immune profile, together with an increased number of effector regulatory T cells. These results were confirmed in a validation cohort using conventional flow cytometry. Furthermore, RNA transcriptome analysis identified the upregulation of immune-related pathways in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells during relapse, suggesting interaction with the surrounding environment. In conclusion, a tumor immune environment characterized by a T helper 1-polarized immune profile, with an increased number of effector regulatory T cells, could contribute to the pathophysiology of recurrent B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This information could contribute to the development of effective immunotherapeutic approaches against B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Given the recent development of effective low intensity therapies, an optimal decision on the therapy intensity may improve survival through the avoidance of early mortality. We reviewed the outcome of 3728 patients with newly diagnosed AML who received intensive chemotherapy between August 1980 and May 2020. Intensive chemotherapy was defined as a cumulative cytarabine dose >/= 700 mg/m(2) during induction therapy. We divided the whole cohort into a training and validation group at a 3:1 ratio. The population was divided into a training (2790 patients) and a validation cohort (938 patients). The median age was 55 years (range, 15-99). Among them, 442 patients (12%) had core-binding factor AML. Binary logistic regression identified older age, worse performance status, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated creatinine, hyperuricemia, cytogenetic abnormalities other than CBF and -Y, and pneumonia as adverse prognostic factors for an early 4-week mortality. This risk classification for early mortality was verified in the validation cohort of patients. In the validation cohort of more recently treated patients from 2000 to 2017, the 4-week mortality rates with intensive chemotherapy were 2%, 14%, and 50% in the low-, high-, and very high-risk group, respectively. The mortality rates with low intensity therapies were 3%, 9%, and 20%, respectively. The risk classification guides treatment intensity by the assessment of age, frailty, organ dysfunction, cytogenetic abnormality, and infection to avoid early mortality.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Sasaki, Koji', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Begna, Kebede', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Daver, Naval', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Bravo, Guillermo Montalban', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Sasaki K', 'Kadia T', 'Begna K', 'DiNardo CD', 'Borthakur G', 'Short NJ', 'Jain N', 'Daver N', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Bravo GM', 'Masarova L', 'Pierce S', 'Konopleva M', 'Ravandi F', 'Tefferi A', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211109,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,,2021/10/31 06:00,2021/10/31 06:00,['2021/10/30 12:12'],"['2021/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/30 12:12 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26395 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2022 Jan 1;97(1):68-78. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26395.

In the current work, it is demonstrated that position-scanning peptide libraries themselves can serve as improved immunogens, inducing Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells with greater frequency and function than the wild-type epitope. The approach involves displaying the entire position-scanning library onto immunogenic nanoliposomes. Each library contains the MHC-I epitope with a single randomized position. When a recently identified MHC-I epitope in the glycoprotein gp70 envelope protein of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is assessed, only one of the eight positional libraries tested, randomized at amino acid position 5 (Pos5), shows enhanced induction of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells. A second MHC-I epitope from gp70 is assessed in the same manner and shows, in contrast, multiple positional libraries (Pos1, Pos3, Pos5, and Pos8) as well as the library mixture give rise to enhanced CD8(+) T cell responses. The library mixture Pos1-3-5-8 induces a more diverse epitope-specific T-cell repertoire with superior antitumor efficacy compared to an established single mutation mimotope (AH1-A5). These data show that positional peptide libraries can serve as immunogens for improving CD8(+) T-cell responses against endogenously expressed MHC-I epitopes.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We conducted this matched case-control study to identify the risk factors for LZD-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during the period of myelosuppression. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved laboratory and clinical data from the medical records of 180 Chinese with AML. Among them, 60 received >/= 72 h of therapy with LZD during myelosuppression. The remaining patients who did not receive LZD therapy were matched individually in a ratio of 1:2 according to the basic characteristics of the LZD group. RESULTS: We found that in the LZD group, age, history of liver or kidney disease, the baseline level of bilirubin, and creatinine clearance rate (CCR) did not affect the recovery time of platelets. Patients who received LZD for more than 7 days during the period of myelosuppression had a significantly longer time of platelet recovery and platelet count increase. CONCLUSION: The use of LZD > 7 days during the course of myelosuppression and the low level of albumin can prolong the time required for platelet count increase and recovery. Further study is needed to assess the potential adverse effects of LZD in larger AML patient populations.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we show that first-in-class Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFRalpha) inhibitor EC359 could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of HDACi against TNBC. We observed that both targeted knockdown of LIFR with CRISPR or treatment with EC359 enhanced the potency of four different HDACi in reducing cell viability, cell survival, and enhanced apoptosis compared to monotherapy in TNBC cells. RNA-seq studies demonstrated oncogenic/survival signaling pathways activated by HDACi were attenuated by the EC359 + HDACi therapy. Importantly, combination therapy potently inhibited the growth of TNBC patient derived explants, cell derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that targeted inhibition of LIFR can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of HDACi in TNBC.",['(c) 2021.

Despite an established contribution of nuclear membrane proteins to developmental gene regulation, little is known regarding the role of inner nuclear proteins. Here we demonstrate that loss of the nuclear scaffolding protein Matrin-3 (Matr3) in erythroid cells leads to morphological and gene expression changes characteristic of accelerated maturation, as well as broad alterations in chromatin organization similar to those accompanying differentiation. Matr3 protein interacts with CTCF and the cohesin complex, and its loss perturbs their occupancy at a subset of sites. Destabilization of CTCF and cohesin binding correlates with altered transcription and accelerated differentiation. This association is conserved in embryonic stem cells.

Therapy is indicated in symptomatic and advanced stages and has changed fundamentally since 2010 when rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, has been approved for treatment of CLL. Until then therapy had been based on chemotherapy drugs. This study investigates whether survival in CLL patients improved at the population level after the introduction of combined chemoimmunotherapy. Data from the cancer registry North-Rhine Westphalia was used to calculate relative survival (RS) by applying period analyses. Age-standardized 5-year RS increased from 79% in 1998-2002 (75% in 2003-2007) to 81% in the calendar period 2008-2012 and 88% in 2013-2016 for men and continuously from 71% in 1998-2002 to 92% in 2013-2016 for women. In CLL patients aged 15-69 years 5-year RS increased from 83% to 90% for men and from 82% to 94% for women after adding an anti-CD20-antibody to chemotherapy while in the older age group of 70-79-year-old CLL patients an increase by 20 percentage points was observed. These findings show marked improvements in the survival of CLL patients at the population level subsequently to the approval of anti-CD 20 antibodies like rituximab, ofatumumab or obinutuzumab for CLL treatment.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: This cohort study included 139 100 children born at >/=35 weeks' gestation from 1995 to 2017, followed through March 16, 2019, in Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals who had a qualifying bilirubin level from -3 mg/dL to +4.9 mg/dL from the American Academy of Pediatrics phototherapy threshold; an additional 40 780 children and 5 years of follow-up from our previous report. The exposure was inpatient phototherapy (yes or no), and the outcomes were various types of childhood cancer. We used Cox proportional hazard models, controlling for propensity-score quintiles, and allowed for time-dependent exposure effects to assess for the risk of cancer after a latent period. RESULTS: Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 8.2 (5.7) years, the crude incidence of cancer per 100 000 person-years was 25.1 among those exposed to phototherapy and 19.2 among those not exposed (233 cases of cancer). After propensity adjustment, phototherapy was not associated with any cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.54), hematopoietic cancer (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.74-1.83), or solid tumors (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.65-1.58). We also found no association with cancer diagnoses at age >/=4 years.

Inherent in the nature of genomic testing, there exists potential for identifying genomic findings that are incidental or secondary to the indication for clinical testing, with the frequency dependent on the breadth of analysis and the tissue sample under study. The interpretation and management of clinically meaningful incidental genomic findings is a pressing issue particularly in the pediatric population. Our study describes a 16-mo-old male who presented with profound global delays, brain abnormality, progressive microcephaly, and growth deficiency, as well as metopic craniosynostosis. Clinical exome sequencing (ES) trio analysis revealed the presence of two variants in the proband. The first was a de novo variant in the PPP2R1A gene (c.773G > A, p.Arg258His), which is associated with autosomal dominant (AD) intellectual disability, accounting for the proband's clinical phenotype. The second was a recurrent hotspot variant in the CBL gene (c.1111T > C, p.Tyr371His), which was present at a variant allele fraction of 11%, consistent with somatic variation in the peripheral blood sample. Germline pathogenic variants in CBL are associated with AD Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Molecular analyses using a different tissue source, buccal epithelial cells, suggest that the CBL alteration may represent a clonal population of cells restricted to leukocytes.

Gene-expression studies in DNMT3A-mutated cells identified signatures implicated in deregulated DNA damage response and replication fork integrity, suggesting sensitivity to replication stress. Here, we tested whether pharmacologically induced replication fork stalling, such as with cytarabine, creates a therapeutic vulnerability in cells with DNMT3A(R882) mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Leukemia cell lines, genetic mouse models, and isogenic cells with and without DNMT3A(mut) were used to evaluate sensitivity to nucleoside analogues such as cytarabine in vitro and in vivo, followed by analysis of DNA damage and signaling, replication restart, and cell-cycle progression on treatment and after drug removal. Transcriptome profiling identified pathways deregulated by DNMT3A(mut) expression. RESULTS: We found increased sensitivity to pharmacologically induced replication stress in cells expressing DNMT3A(R882)-mutant, with persistent intra-S-phase checkpoint activation, impaired PARP1 recruitment, and elevated DNA damage, which was incompletely resolved after drug removal and carried through mitosis. Pulse-chase double-labeling experiments with EdU and BrdU after cytarabine washout demonstrated a higher rate of fork collapse in DNMT3A(mut)-expressing cells. RNA-seq studies supported deregulated cell-cycle progression and p53 activation, along with splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our studies show that DNMT3A mutations underlie a defect in recovery from replication fork arrest with subsequent accumulation of unresolved DNA damage, which may have therapeutic tractability. These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in epigenetic control, DNMT3A contributes to preserving genome integrity during replication stress.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the

We reviewed 8515 tests on 2035 patients, who had allogenic sex mismatched SCT and underwent serial cytogenetic analysis between 2006 and 2020 in our institution. A constitutional CCA was observed in 3 patients: inv(10), t(1;5), and t(13;14). A somatic CCA without overt neoplasia was detected in 12 patients: del(7q) (n = 6), del(20q) (n = 3), der(11)t(11;11) (n = 1), t(1;9) (n = 1), dup(6p)(n = 1). In this group, four patients with cytopenia had del(7q), and an association between del(7q) and an adverse overall survival (OS) was observed [HR:5.99; 95%CI 1.23-29.92). Four patients had a donor-derived cell neoplasm: myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 3) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1), and all four neoplasms had loss of 7q. In our cohort, approximately 1% of the patients (19/2,035) had CCA in donor-derived cells. Balanced constitutional CCA can pose a reproductive risk to donor.

Practices have changed along time in our center regarding length of antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to compare long versus short antibiotic course for bloodstream infection (BSI) treatment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients during FN. METHODS: This monocentric retrospective comparative study included all consecutive BSI episodes among AML patients with FN for 3 years (2017-2019). Episodes were classified regarding the length of antibiotic treatment, considered as short course if the treatment lasted </= 7 days, except for nonfermenting bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus or lugdunensis for which the threshold was </= 10 days and </= 14 days, respectively. The primary outcome was the number of BSI relapses in both groups within 30 days of antibiotic discontinuation. RESULTS: Among 71 AML patients, 104 BSI episodes were included; 48 (46%) received short course treatment. Only 8 (7.6%) BSI episodes relapsed within 30 days of antibiotic discontinuation, 5 having received short course treatment. No association was found between risk of relapse and short course of antibiotic treatment (p = 0.37). The only risk factor significantly associated with BSI relapse was neutropenia duration (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic short course seemed as effective as prolonged treatment for BSI in AML patients during FN, with very few relapses at day 30. These encouraging findings should be confirmed through prospective studies.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

In the primary analysis of SOLO1/GOG 3004, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo in patients with a BRCA mutation; median progression-free survival was not reached. Here, we report an updated, post-hoc analysis of progression-free survival from SOLO1, after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: SOLO1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, done across 118 centres in 15 countries, that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 and with BRCA-mutated, newly diagnosed, advanced, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer with a complete or partial clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via a web-based or interactive voice-response system to receive olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or placebo tablets orally as maintenance monotherapy for up to 2 years; randomisation was by blocks and was stratified according to clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients, treatment providers, and data assessors were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Efficacy is reported in the intention-to-treat population and safety in patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The data cutoff for this updated, post-hoc analysis was March 5, 2020. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01844986) and is ongoing but closed to new participants. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2013, and March 6, 2015, 260 patients were randomly assigned to olaparib and 131 to placebo. The median treatment duration was 24.6 months (IQR 11.2-24.9) in the olaparib group and 13.9 months (8.0-24.8) in the placebo group; median follow-up was 4.8 years (2.8-5.3) in the olaparib group and 5.0 years (2.6-5.3) in the placebo group. In this post-hoc analysis, median progression-free survival was 56.0 months (95% CI 41.9-not reached) with olaparib versus 13.8 months (11.1-18.2) with placebo (hazard ratio 0.33 [95% CI 0.25-0.43]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were anaemia (57 [22%] of 260 patients receiving olaparib vs two [2%] of 130 receiving placebo) and neutropenia (22 [8%] vs six [5%]), and serious adverse events occurred in 55 (21%) of 260 patients in the olaparib group and 17 (13%) of 130 in the placebo group. No treatment-related adverse events that occurred during study treatment or up to 30 days after discontinuation were reported as leading to death. No additional cases of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia were reported since the primary data cutoff, including after the 30-day safety follow-up period. INTERPRETATION: For patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation, after, to our knowledge, the longest follow-up for any randomised controlled trial of a PARP inhibitor in this setting, the benefit derived from 2 years' maintenance therapy with olaparib was sustained beyond the end of treatment, extending median progression-free survival past 4.5 years. These results support the use of maintenance olaparib as a standard of care in this setting.

Proliferation of memory CD4 + T cells is the primary mechanism that leads to persistence of the latent reservoir, despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Memory CD4 + T cells are long-lived and can proliferate through two mechanisms: homeostatic proliferation via gammac-cytokine stimulation or antigen-driven proliferation. Therefore, therapeutic modalities that perturb homeostatic and antigen-driven proliferation, combined with ART, represent promising strategies to reduce the latent reservoir. In this study, we investigated a library of FDA-approved oncology drugs to determine their ability to inhibit homeostatic and/or antigen-driven proliferation. We confirmed potential hits by evaluating their effects on proliferation in memory CD4 + T cells from people living with HIV-1 on ART (PLWH) and interrogated downstream signaling of gammac-cytokine stimulation. We found that dasatinib and ponatinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, reduced both homeostatic and antigen-driven proliferationby >65%, with a reduction in viability <45%, ex vivo. In memory CD4 + T cells from PLWH, only dasatinib restricted both homeostatic and antigen-driven proliferation and prevented spontaneous rebound, consistent with promoting a smaller reservoir size. We show that dasatinib restricts IL-7 induced proliferation through STAT5 phosphorylation inhibition. Our results establish that the anti-cancer agent dasatinib is an exciting candidate to be used as an anti-proliferative drug in a clinical trial, since it efficiently blocks proliferation and iswell tolerated in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that the transcriptional regulator CITED2 is essential for life-long HSC maintenance. While hematopoietic-specific Cited2 deletion has a minor impact on steady-state hematopoiesis, Cited2-deficient HSCs are severely depleted in young mice and fail to expand upon aging. Moreover, although they home normally to the bone marrow, they fail to reconstitute hematopoiesis upon transplantation. Mechanistically, CITED2 is required for expression of key HSC regulators, including GATA2, MCL-1, and PTEN. Hematopoietic-specific expression of anti-apoptotic MCL-1 partially rescues the Cited2-deficient HSC pool and restores their reconstitution potential. To interrogate the Cited2-->Pten pathway in HSCs, we generated Cited2;Pten compound heterozygous mice, which had a decreased number of HSCs that failed to reconstitute the HSC compartment. In addition, CITED2 represses multiple pathways whose elevated activity causes HSC exhaustion. Thus, CITED2 promotes pathways necessary for HSC maintenance and suppresses those detrimental to HSC integrity.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, some patients relapse and, given its prevalence, patients with high hyperdiploidy account for a large proportion of all relapses. We aimed to evaluate putative risk factors and determine the optimal pattern of trisomies for predicting outcome. METHODS: We used discovery and validation cohorts from consecutive trials-UKALL97/99 (n=456) and UKALL2003 (n=725)-to develop the prognostic profile. UKALL97/99 recruited patients aged 1-18 years between Jan 1, 1997, and June 15, 2002, and UKALL2003 recruited children and young adults aged 1-24 years between Oct 1, 2003, and June 30, 2001, from the UK and Ireland who were newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation testing was performed on pre-treatment bone marrow samples by regional UK National Health Service genetic laboratories or centrally by the Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, and results were reported using established nomenclature and definitions. We examined the prognostic effect of previously proposed genetic and non-genetic risk factors among patients with high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on UKALL2003. We used Bayesian information criterion, targeted projection pursuit, and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal number of trisomies, and best subset regression and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal combination. Survival analysis considered three endpoints, as follows: event-free survival, defined as time to relapse, second tumour, or death, censored at last contact; relapse rate, defined as time to relapse for those reaching complete remission, censored at death in remission or last contact; and overall survival, defined as time to death, censored at last contact. FINDINGS: The median follow-up time for UKALL97/99 was 10.59 years (IQR 9.25-12.06) and 9.40 years (8.00-11.55) for UKALL2003. UKALL97/99 included 208 female patients and 248 male patients, and UKALL2003 included 345 female patients and 380 male patients. We deduced that the trisomic status of four chromosomes provided the optimal information for predicting outcome. The good risk profile comprised karyotypes with +17 and +18 or +17 or +18 in the absence of +5 and +20. All remaining cases were classified in the poor risk profile. The ratio of patients with good risk and poor risk was 82:18 and 80:20 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. In the validation cohort, patients with the high hyperdiploid good risk profile had an improved response to treatment compared with other patients with high hyperdiploidy at 10 years (relapse rate 5% [95% CI 3-7] vs 16% [10-23]; p<0.0001; event-free survival 92% [90-94] vs 81% [73-86]; p<0.0001; and overall survival 96% [94-97] vs 86% [79-91]; p<0.0001). The outcome for high hyperdiploid poor risk patients was similar to that of patients with an intermediate cytogenetic profile. The prognostic effect of the UKALL high hyperdiploid profile was independent of minimal residual disease and the profile outperformed other high hyperdiploid risk profiles. INTERPRETATION: Future clinical trials and treatment protocols using high hyperdiploidy as a risk stratification factor should consider modifying the definition beyond chromosome count to incorporate this novel UKALL high hyperdiploid profile.

However, the molecular mechanism by which it promotes the development of myeloid leukemia remains largely unknown. We find that Bcl11a cooperates with the pseudokinase, Trib1, in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bcl11a promotes the proliferation and engraftment of Trib1-expressing AML cells both in vitro and in vivo. ChIP-seq analysis showed that upon DNA-binding, Bcl11a is significantly associated with PU.1, an inducer of myeloid differentiation, and that Bcl11a represses several PU.1 target genes, such as Asb2, Clec5a, and Fcgr3. Asb2, as a Bcl11a target gene that modulates cytoskeleton and cell-cell interaction, plays a key role in Bcl11a-induced malignant progression. The repression of PU.1 target genes by Bcl11a is achieved by both sequence-specific DNA-binding activity and recruitment of corepressors by Bcl11a. Suppression of the corepressor components, HDAC and LSD1, reverses the repressive activity. Moreover, treatment of AML cells with the HDAC inhibitor, pracinostat, and LSD1 inhibitor, GSK2879552, resulted in growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. High BCL11A expression is associated with worse prognosis in human AML patients. Blocking of BCL11A expression upregulates the expression of PU.1 target genes, and inhibits the growth of HL-60 cells and their engraftment to the bone marrow, suggesting that BCL11A is involved in human myeloid malignancies via the suppression of PU.1 transcriptional activity.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Sunami, Yoshitaka', 'Yokoyama, Takashi', 'Yoshino, Seiko', 'Takahara, Tomoko', 'Yamazaki, Yukari', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Nakamura, Takuro']","['Sunami Y', 'Yokoyama T', 'Yoshino S', 'Takahara T', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Harada H', 'Nakamura T']","['The Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'University of Yamanashi, Japan.', 'The Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'The Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'The Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan.', 'The Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211029,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 17:20'],"['2021/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/29 17:20 [entrez]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['477725 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004558 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Oct 29. pii: 477725. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004558.,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9401-5470', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0419-7547']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both (an)aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) have been studied. Here, we review recent literature on energy production in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) versus their normal counterparts, neural stem cells (NSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), respectively. These two cancer stem cell types were compared because their niches in glioblastoma tumors and in bone marrow are similar. In this study, it became apparent that (1) ATP is produced in NSCs and HSCs by anaerobic glycolysis, whereas fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is essential for their stem cell fate and (2) ATP is produced in GSCs and LSCs by OXPHOS despite the hypoxic conditions in their niches with FAO and amino acids providing its substrate. These metabolic processes appeared to be under tight control of cellular regulation mechanisms which are discussed in depth. However, our conclusion is that systemic therapeutic targeting of ATP production via glycolysis or OXPHOS is not an attractive option because of its unwanted side effects in cancer patients.",,"['van Noorden, Cornelis J F', 'Breznik, Barbara', 'Novak, Metka', 'van Dijck, Amber J', 'Tanan, Saloua', 'Vittori, Milos', 'Bogataj, Urban', 'Bakker, Noelle', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Molenaar, Remco J', 'Hira, Vashendriya V V']","['van Noorden CJF', 'Breznik B', 'Novak M', 'van Dijck AJ', 'Tanan S', 'Vittori M', 'Bogataj U', 'Bakker N', 'Khoury JD', 'Molenaar RJ', 'Hira VVV']","['Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medical Biology.', 'Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medical Biology.', 'Department of Medical Biology.', 'Amsterdam UMC Location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Biology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Amsterdam UMC Location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Biology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medical Biology.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology.', 'Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211029,United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['angiogenesis', 'bone marrow', 'brain tumors', 'cancer stem cells', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells', 'metabolism', 'neural stem cells', 'niches', 'stem cells', 'stemness', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immune infiltrate', 'tumor microenvironment']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 17:11'],"['2023/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/29 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1369/00221554211054585 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2022 Jan;70(1):29-51. doi: 10.1369/00221554211054585.

METHODS: The cohort consisted of 13,009 Swedish CLL patients diagnosed 1982-2013. Relative survival (RS) and excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using flexible parametric survival models. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for the linear effect of 10-year increase in year of diagnosis. RESULTS: The excess mortality decreased comparing 2003-2013 to 1982-1992 (EMRR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.58). The 5-year RS increased between 1982 and 2012 for patients >51 years at diagnosis and improved for patients </=51 years after 2002. The rate of CLL-specific deaths decreased over time (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.75-0.81). Compared to patients with no comorbidity, patients with 1 and 2+ Charlson Comorbidity Index points had HR = 1.35 (95% CI 1.25-1.45) and HR = 1.47 (95% CI 1.37-1.57) for CLL-related mortality, respectively. CONCLUSION: Survival in CLL patients improved in the era of chemoimmunotherapy, and this was largely explained by reduced CLL-related mortality. The increased rate of CLL-related mortality in patients with comorbidities emphasizes the importance of the newer and better tolerated targeted therapy.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Few studies have examined ICH specifically in newly diagnosed AML patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy (IC) and prophylactic platelet transfusions during thrombocytopenia <10/nL. This retrospective cohort study included 423 newly diagnosed AML patients without acute promyelocytic leukemia who underwent IC between 2007 and 2019. We assessed risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes of ICH. RESULTS: 17 of 423 patients (4%) suffered ICH during hospital stay, and 4 patients (24%) died directly because of ICH despite routine prophylactic platelet transfusions. Patients with ICH had a negatively impacted overall survival (median OS, 20.1 vs. 104.8 months) and were more likely not to continue with curative treatment. Main risk factors were female gender, severe thrombocytopenia, and decreased fibrinogen. Patients with subsequent ICH also had laboratory signs of liver dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial hemorrhage remains a potentially deadly complication with notable incidence despite prophylactic platelet substitution, suggesting that additional prophylactic interventions may be required to further reduce the frequency of ICH in high-risk patients. Unrecognized genetic factors may simultaneously predispose to AML and platelet dysfunction with ICH.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Although several case series have been published describing hematological and molecular responses to azacitidine (AZA) treatment in patients with JMML, the efficacy and safety profile of AZA is not well investigated, especially in Asian children and children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We retrospectively analyzed 5 patients who received a total of 12 cycles (median 2 cycles) of AZA treatment in Japan. All five patients were boys and their ages at the time of treatment were 21, 23, 24, 26, and 46 months, respectively. All five patients tolerated AZA treatment, including four patients who received AZA after HSCT. Therapeutic toxicity with AZA was mostly limited to hematological toxicity. The only serious non-hematological adverse event was hyperbilirubinemia (grades III-IV) observed in a patient who received AZA after a second HSCT. Two out of five patients treated with AZA achieved a partial response (PR), while three patients treated for post-transplant relapse did not have an objective response.

METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire was given to children with CML and their parents, who were < 18 years at diagnosis of CML and < 19 years at study. The questionnaire comprised three parts, including demographic information, clinical information, and the Chinese version of Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory() (PedsQL()) Cancer Module 3.0 as HRQoL questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 240 respondents data were analyzed. Multivariate analysis showed that children with symptoms had worse pain (- 10.2; P < 0.001), nausea (- 17.3; P = 0.001), more treatment anxiety (- 7.2; P = 0.005), worse self-assessment appearance (- 7.1; P = 0.001), communication problems (- 6.4; P = 0.001), and worse HRQoL (- 7.0; P < 0.001). Children with mothers having low educational qualifications had worse pain (- 6.0; P = 0.014), more worried about future (- 5.4; P = 0.042), worse cognition problems (- 7.1; P = 0.002), worse communication problems (- 5.5; P = 0.008), and worse HRQoL (- 4.3; P = 0.005). Younger age children at study had more procedural anxiety (2.7; P = 0.001), treatment anxiety (- 1.7; P = 0.014) and cognition problem (3.6; P < 0.001), as well as worse HRQoL (1.8; P = 0.008). However, older age children at diagnosis were more worried about future (- 2.8; P = 0.001), worse self-assessment appearance (- 1.1; P = 0.042) and worse HRQoL (- 1.8; P = 0.007). Other variables significantly associated with worse HRQoL included female gender, rural household registration and their father's low education level. Parents reported more gastrointestinal disorders, were worried about the future and had less concern about appearance than their children. CONCLUSIONS: Female gender, older age at diagnosis, younger age at study, lower mother's education level, and TKI-related symptoms are significantly associated with worse HRQoL in Children with CML. Children and their parents have different priorities in the HRQoL.","['(c) 2021.

Methods: New South Wales Cancer Registry and treatment data were linked to explore differences in cancer type, stage, time to treatment, and survival between AYAs, children, and adults. Multivariable logistic regression and competing-risk regression were adjusted for sociodemographic, diagnostic period, and clinical characteristics. Results: Most common cancers in AYAs and adults were carcinomas compared with leukemias in children. Advanced (regional and distant) stage applied to 33% of AYA solid cancers, which was similar to adult stages, but lower than the 40% for children (adjusted odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.47). Proportions starting treatment </=60 days from diagnosis were 93% for AYAs and children, and 94% for adults, with higher adjusted odds of starting </=60 days of 1.39 (95% CI 1.11-1.73) for children and 1.23 (95% CI 1.06-1.44) for adults. Five-year disease-specific survival was 90% for AYAs and adults, and 87% for children. The adjusted subhazard ratio for children compared with AYAs was 0.67 (95% CI 0.52-0.88). Age differences in cancer stage, treatment start, and cancer survival varied by cancer type. Conclusions: After adjusting for cancer type, diagnostic period, and sociodemographic characteristics, AYAs had less advanced solid tumors than children; fewer AYAs were treated within 60 days than children and adults; and AYA survival was lower than for children.

Treatments include chemoimmunotherapy, such as obinutuzumab (G) plus chlorambucil (Clb) or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR), and chemotherapy-free regimens incorporating oral targeted therapies such as ibrutinib (Ibr), acalabrutinib (Acala), or venetoclax (Ven). Most chemotherapy-free regimens require continuous treatment to progression, while Ven plus G (VenG) is given for a fixed duration of 12 months, based on the CLL14 trial that led to its approval. Fixed-duration VenG has the potential for cost savings compared with treat-to-progression chemotherapy-free regimens. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 12 months fixed-duration VenG in first-line treatment of unfit patients with CLL from a US health care payer perspective compared with GClb, BR, Ibr, Ibr + G, Ibr + R, Acala, and Acala + G. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed with 3 health states: progression-free survival (PFS), postprogression survival, and dead. The patient population, as based on the CLL14 trial, comprised previously untreated unfit patients with CLL (mean age 71.1 years, 33.1% female). The distribution of patients in each health state over time was estimated using extrapolated PFS and overall survival (OS) curves for VenG and GClb, based on CLL14 data 2 or more years after treatment cessation. PFS and OS for the other comparators were estimated using hazard ratios vs VenG, based on a network metaanalysis. Adverse events, utility values, and costs were obtained from published literature. The model estimated life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and costs. The time horizon was 20 years, with a cycle time of 28 days. Outcomes and costs were discounted at 3.0% per year, and costs were estimated from a US health care payer perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In this cross-trial analysis of unfit CLL patients, in the base case, VenG had lower projected total costs than all comparators investigated. VenG also had larger projected health benefits (more QALYs gained) than GClb, BR, Ibr, and Ibr + R. VenG was therefore more effective and less costly than these comparators (dominant). Ibr + G, Acala, and Acala + G showed higher QALYs gained vs VenG (0.022, 0.672, and 0.961, respectively), and substantially higher projected costs vs VenG ($1,488,400, $1,579,737, and $1,656,154, respectively). Thus, Ibr + G, Acala, and Acala + G would cost more than $1,000,000 per QALY gained vs VenG. At the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained, Ibr + G, Acala, and Acala + G were not cost-effective compared with VenG. CONCLUSIONS: Fixed-duration VenG for 12 months is a cost-effective first-line treatment option for unfit CLL patients compared with other available options and provides value for money to US health care payers at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. Future studies with longer trial follow-up and more mature survival data may help to confirm longer-term cost benefits of VenG.

This disease has not seen the improvements in outcomes experienced with other paediatric leukaemias and it is becoming ever more apparent that infant leukaemia is a distinct biological entity. Insights into some of the distinguishing features of infant leukaemia, such as a single mutation - the MLL-gene rearrangement, the biology of disease aggressiveness and lineage plasticity, and the high incidence of central nervous system involvement, are likely to be gained from understanding the interactions between leukaemic cells and their environment or niche. The origins of infant leukaemia lie in the embryonic haematopoietic system, which is characterised by shifting locations and dynamic changes in the microenvironment. Understanding this foetal or embryonic context is integral to understanding infant leukaemia development. Owing to its rarity and prenatal origins, developing accurate modelling systems for further investigation of infant leukaemia is essential. In this Review, we discuss how available in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo infant leukaemia models contribute to our current understanding of the leukaemia niche in embryonic development, established disease and specialised non-haematopoietic niches.

This modality confers a risk for life-threatening complications, including the rare and underdiagnosed complication of donor-derived leukemia (DDL). DDL differs from relapse of the original malignancy in that DDL originates from the donor stem cells and is unrelated to the original diagnosis. Because DDL may be the same lineage as the original diagnosis, it is difficult to identify these cases and many remain unrecognized. There is no consensus of how to approach the treatment of patients with DDL, and their prognosis is poor considering that patients with DDL have already been treated for their original leukemia and have undergone alloHCT. DDL occurs following transplants using any donor stem cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood) and any donor type (matched/unmatched, related/unrelated and haploidentical).

However, a percentage of patients exhibit clopidogrel resistance, in which genetic factors play vital roles. This study aimed to investigate the roles of GAS5 (growth arrest-specific 5) and its rs55829688 polymorphism in clopidogrel response in patients with CAD. Methods and Results A total of 444 patients with CAD receiving dual antiplatelet therapy from 2017 to 2018 were enrolled to evaluate the effect of GAS5 single nucleotide polymorphism rs55829688 on platelet reactivity index. Platelets from 37 patients of these patients were purified with microbeads to detect GAS5 and microRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) expression. Platelet-rich plasma was isolated from another 17 healthy volunteers and 46 newly diagnosed patients with CAD to detect GAS5 and miR-223-3p expression. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to explore the interaction between miR-223-3p and GAS5 or P2Y12 3'-UTR in (human embryonic kidney 293 cell line that expresses a mutant version of the SV40 large T antigen) HEK 293T and (megakaryoblastic cell line derived in 1983 from the bone marrow of a chronic myeloid leukemia patient with megakaryoblastic crisis) MEG-01 cells. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were performed to reveal the regulation of GAS5 toward P2Y12 via miR-223-3p in MEG-01 cells. We observed that rs55829688 CC homozygotes showed significantly decreased platelet reactivity index than TT homozygotes in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. Platelet GAS5 expression correlated positively with both platelet reactivity index and P2Y12 mRNA expressions, whereas platelet miR-223-3p expression negatively correlated with platelet reactivity index. Meanwhile, a negative correlation between GAS5 and miR-223-3p expressions was observed in platelets. MiR-223-3p mimic reduced while the miR-223-3p inhibitor increased the expression of GAS5 and P2Y12 in MEG-01 cells. Knockdown of GAS5 by siRNA increased miR-223-3p expression and decreased P2Y12 expression, which could be reversed by the miR-223-3p inhibitor. Meanwhile, overexpression of GAS5 reduced miR-223-3p expression and increased P2Y12 expression, which could be reversed by miR-223-3p mimic. Conclusions GAS5 rs55829688 polymorphism might affect clopidogrel response in patients with CAD with the CYP2C19 poor metabolizer genotypes, and GAS5 regulates P2Y12 expression and clopidogrel response by acting as a competitive endogenous RNA for miR-223-3p.",,"['Liu, Yan-Ling', 'Hu, Xiao-Lei', 'Song, Pei-Yuan', 'Li, He', 'Li, Mu-Peng', 'Du, Yin-Xiao', 'Li, Mo-Yun', 'Ma, Qi-Lin', 'Peng, Li-Ming', 'Song, Ming-Yu', 'Chen, Xiao-Ping']","['Liu YL', 'Hu XL', 'Song PY', 'Li H', 'Li MP', 'Du YX', 'Li MY', 'Ma QL', 'Peng LM', 'Song MY', 'Chen XP']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Neurology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University Hunan Key Laboratory of PharmacogeneticsChangsha Hunan China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders Xiangya HospitalCentral South University Changsha Hunan China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211029,England,J Am Heart Assoc,Journal of the American Heart Association,101580524,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*GAS5', '*P2Y12', '*clopidogrel', '*coronary artery disease', '*miR-223-3p', '*rs55829688']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 08:41'],"['2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/29 08:41 [entrez]']",['10.1161/JAHA.121.021129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Heart Assoc. 2021 Nov 2;10(21):e021129. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.121.021129.

Careful consideration is needed regarding treatment duration and sequence, how best to meet patients' needs, balancing toxicities while improving long-term survival and maximizing depth of response. This review addresses these considerations and discusses current targeted treatment dilemmas. Targeted therapies have dramatically transformed the CLL treatment landscape. Two treatment paradigms have emerged using B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors (BCL2i) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK): (i) fixed duration and (ii) continuous treatment. The BCL2i venetoclax can attain deep remissions with a fixed-duration approach, resulting in high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients with CLL. BTKis such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib achieve high objective response rates and long-term disease control, although they rarely attain complete response or uMRD status as monotherapy. Numerous studies are evaluating the clinical utility of BTKi and BCL2i as combination therapies, where deep remissions have been found to occur. MRD status may also be a useful marker for deciding when to stop continuous therapy, and randomized trials on MRD-guided treatment strategies are currently ongoing. The current treatment choice between continuous or fixed-duration therapy should be based on comorbidities, risks, preferences, and treatment goals, whilst areas of emerging clinical interest include the potential utility of BTKi-BCL2i combination therapies, as well as an MRD-guided treatment strategies in the future.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Eyre, Toby A', 'Hori, Satoshi', 'Munir, Talha']","['Eyre TA', 'Hori S', 'Munir T']","['Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'AstraZeneca, London, UK.', ""The Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211028,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor (BCL2 inhibitor)', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK inhibitor)"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'continuous treatment', 'fixed-duration']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 06:43'],"['2021/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/29 06:43 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2943 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Oct 28. doi: 10.1002/hon.2943.,,,,,,,['AstraZeneca'],,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6631-9749'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IGHV4-34 is one of the most frequently used genes in CLL patients, which usually display an indolent outcome. In this study, we explored the mutational profile of CLL patients expressing IGHV4-34 within different stereotypes and their association with prognostic factors and clinical outcome. A multi-institutional cohort of unselected 1444 CLL patients was analyzed by RT-PCR and bidirectional sequencing. Cytogenetics and molecular cytogenetics analyses were also performed. We identified 144 (10%) IGHV4-34 expressing cases, 119 mutated (M), 44 of them with stereotyped B-cell receptors. Subset #4 was the most frequent (56.8% of cases) followed by subsets #16 (13.6%), #29 (6.8%), and #201 (2.3%), with different distribution among countries. Analysis of somatic hypermutation profile showed significant differences among stereotyped subsets for G28>D/E, P45>S, E55>Q, and S64>I changes (p < 0.01) and high frequency of disruption of the glycosylation motif in the VH CDR2 region. All stereotyped IGHV4-34 cases showed normal karyotypes. Deletion 13q14 as a sole alteration was present in 42.8% of stereotyped cases with a different distribution among subsets.

Trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 is associated with transcription activation. There are currently six known methylases and six known demethylases that can control the methylation status of this site. Lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is one such demethylase, which can repress gene expression. In particular KDM5B has been found to be overexpressed in a number of cancer types, and smallmolecular weight inhibitors of its demethylase activity have been identified. Previous characterisation of Kdm5b knockout mice has revealed that this genotype leads to either embryonic or neonatal lethality. However, the DeltaAT rich interaction domain (DeltaARID)KDM5B strain of mice, which have the ARID domain and five amino acids within the Jumonji (Jmj)N domain spliced out from KDM5B, remain viable and fertile. In the present study, DeltaARIDKDM5B was found to have no demethylase activity as determined by in vitro demethylase assays and by immunofluorescence in transfected Cos1 cells. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations revealed conformational changes within the DeltaARIDKDM5B structure compared with that in WTKDM5B, particularly in the JmjC domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity of WTKDM5B. This supports the experimental data that shows the loss of demethylase activity. Since Kdm5b knockout mice show varying degrees of lethality, these data suggest that KDM5B serves a crucial function in development in a manner that is independent of its demethylase activity.",,"['Jamshidi, Shirin', 'Catchpole, Steven', 'Chen, Jie', 'So, Chi Wai Eric', 'Burchell, Joy', 'Rahman, Khondaker Miraz', 'Taylor-Papadimitriou, Joyce']","['Jamshidi S', 'Catchpole S', 'Chen J', 'So CWE', 'Burchell J', 'Rahman KM', 'Taylor-Papadimitriou J']","[""Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London SE1 9NN, UK."", ""Breast Cancer Biology, Innovation Hub, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Guy's Cancer Centre, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Denmark Hill Campus, King's College London, London SE5 9RJ, UK."", ""Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Denmark Hill Campus, King's College London, London SE5 9RJ, UK."", ""Breast Cancer Biology, Innovation Hub, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Guy's Cancer Centre, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London SE1 9NN, UK."", ""Breast Cancer Biology, Innovation Hub, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Guy's Cancer Centre, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211029,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*histone demethylases', '*loss of demethylase activity', '*lysine demethylase 5B', '*molecular dynamics simulation', '*DeltaAT rich interaction domain mice']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 06:36'],"['2021/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/29 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/ijo.2021.5276 [doi]', '96 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2021 Nov;59(5). pii: 96. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2021.5276.

However, their delivery into human blood cells can be challenging. Here, we have utilized ""nanoblades,"" a new technology that delivers a genomic cleaving agent into cells. These are modified murine leukemia virus (MLV) or HIV-derived virus-like particle (VLP), in which the viral structural protein Gag has been fused to Cas9. These VLPs are thus loaded with Cas9 protein complexed with the guide RNAs. Highly efficient gene editing was obtained in cell lines, IPS and primary mouse and human cells. Here, we showed that nanoblades were remarkably efficient for entry into human T, B, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) thanks to their surface co-pseudotyping with baboon retroviral and VSV-G envelope glycoproteins. A brief incubation of human T and B cells with nanoblades incorporating two gRNAs resulted in 40 and 15% edited deletion in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene locus, respectively. CD34(+) cells (HSPCs) treated with the same nanoblades allowed 30-40% exon 1 drop-out in the WAS gene locus. Importantly, no toxicity was detected upon nanoblade-mediated gene editing of these blood cells. Finally, we also treated HSPCs with nanoblades in combination with a donor-encoding rAAV6 vector resulting in up to 40% of stable expression cassette knock-in into the WAS gene locus. Summarizing, this new technology is simple to implement, shows high flexibility for different targets including primary immune cells of human and murine origin, is relatively inexpensive and therefore gives important prospects for basic and clinical translation in the area of gene therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Gutierrez-Guerrero, Abrey Recalde, Mangeot, Costa, Bernadin,', 'Perian, Fusil, Froment,

In children with myeloid leukemia the gene most often mutated is Gata binding protein 2 (GATA2) and 80% of patients with GATA2 mutations develop myeloid malignancy before the age of forty. Although GATA2 is established as one of the key regulators of embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, the mechanisms behind the leukemia predisposition in GATA2 haploinsufficiencies is ambiguous. The only curative treatment option currently available is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, allo-SCT can only be applied at a relatively late stage of the disease as its applicability is compromised by treatment related morbidity and mortality (TRM). Alternatively, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT), which is associated with significantly less TRM, might become a treatment option if repaired hematopoietic stem cells would be available.

There is an ongoing debate on whether relative or absolute quantification of dd-cfDNA is more reliable for the detection of acute transplant injury. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all 22 kidney transplant recipients who underwent dd-cfDNA measurements (percentage and absolute) between April 2020 and April 2021 at our institution. Of these, 9 (41%) showed discrepancies between absolute (cutoff: 50 copies/mL) and relative (cutoff: 0.5%) quantification in at least 1 dd-cfDNA measurement. Results: We report on 9 of 22 cases with discrepancies in relative and absolute quantification of dd-cfDNA, which were predominantly late posttransplant patients. We found bacterial and viral infections, as well as low leukocyte count from chronic myeloid leukaemia treatment, to be reasons for variability in total cell-free DNA (cfDNA), leading to inter- and intraindividual variability in relative dd-cfDNA quantification. When correlating dd-cfDNA quantification and biopsy results, as well as clinical course, our data indicate that relying solely on relative dd-cfDNA can lead to false-negative and false-positive results. Conclusions: In summary, these cases argue that absolute quantification of dd-cfDNA is better suited in patients with underlying conditions affecting total cfDNA levels and suggest using both absolute and relative dd-cfDNA together for higher reliability and interindividual comparability in the clinical setting. Especially for patients with chronic active antibody-mediated rejection, further studies on the use of dd-cfDNA are desirable.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Transplantation Direct.

Especially for AML-M5 type, due to the strong cell migration ability, the possibility of extramedullary invasion is large and widespread, which leads to poor therapeutic effect. Previous studies have found that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) could promote the proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cells in AML, but its regulation on the invasive ability of AML cells remains unclear. This study was designed to explore the role of PRMT5 in regulating the invasion of AML cells and to investigate the mechanisms. Patient samples were collected for detection of PRMT5 expression level. AML cells were used for exploring the function of PRMT5. The results of clinical samples showed that the expression of PRMT5 was significantly increased in newly diagnosed and recurrent AML patients, and the expression of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) was positively correlated with the level of PRMT5. In the cell experiment in vitro, we found that when PRMT5 was knocked down, the invasion, migration, and adhesion capacities of MV-4-11 cells and THP-1 cells were decreased, and the mRNA and protein levels of LILRB4 were also decreased. Moreover, we screened related signaling pathways and found that PRMT5 affected the expression of downstream LILRB4 by activating mTOR pathway, which in turn enhanced the invasive ability of AML cells. Taken together, PRMT5 plays an important role in the invasion of AML, which acts via regulating the expression of LILRB4.

In a retrospective single center cohort study in pediatric patients receiving care at a large european pediatric hematology and oncology department, ten cases of invasive S.maltophilia infections (blood stream infections (BSI), 4; BSI and pneumonia, 3, or soft tissue infection, 2; and pneumonia, 1) were identified between 2010 and 2020. Seven patients had lymphoblastic leukemia and/or were post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Invasive S.maltophilia infections occurred in a setting of indwelling central venous catheters, granulocytopenia, defective mucocutaneous barriers, treatment with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, and admission to the intensive care unit. Whole genome sequencing based typing revealed no genetic relationship among four individual S.maltophilia isolates. The case fatality rate and mortality at 100 days post diagnosis were 40 and 50%, respectively, and three patients died from pulmonary hemorrhage. Invasive S.maltophilia infections are an emerging cause of infectious morbidity in patients receiving care at departments of pediatric hematology and oncology and carry a high case fatality rate.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zollner, Kampmeier, Frobose, Herbruggen, Masjosthusmann, van', 'den Heuvel, Reicherts, Ranft and Groll.']","['Zollner, Stefan K', 'Kampmeier, Stefanie', 'Frobose, Neele J', 'Herbruggen, Heidrun', 'Masjosthusmann, Katja', 'van den Heuvel, Alijda', 'Reicherts, Christian', 'Ranft, Andreas', 'Groll, Andreas H']","['Zollner SK', 'Kampmeier S', 'Frobose NJ', 'Herbruggen H', 'Masjosthusmann K', 'van den Heuvel A', 'Reicherts C', 'Ranft A', 'Groll AH']","[""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Intensive Care Medicine, Department of General Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", 'Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Hygiene, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Intensive Care Medicine, Department of General Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Intensive Care Medicine, Department of General Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", 'Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211012,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Stenotrophomonas maltophilia', 'blood stream infection', 'cancer', 'children', 'pulmonary hemorrhage', 'transplantation']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:01,['2021/10/29 06:29'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/29 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.752037 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 12;11:752037. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.752037. eCollection 2021.,11,,752037,,,PMC8547273,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, a small-molecule inhibitor of RhoGEF can make an anti-cancer drug. We used cellular, mouse, and humanized models of RAC-dependent BCR-ABL1-driven and Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia to identify VAV3, a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent RacGEF, as the target of the small molecule IODVA1. We show that through binding to VAV3, IODVA1 inhibits RAC activation and signaling and increases pro-apoptotic activity in BCR-ABL1-transformed cells. Consistent with this mechanism of action, cellular and animal models of BCR-ABL1-induced leukemia in Vav3-null background do not respond to IODVA1. By durably decreasing in vivo RAC signaling, IODVA1 eradicates leukemic propagating activity of TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1(T315I) B-ALL cells after treatment withdrawal. Importantly, IODVA1 suppresses the leukemic burden in the treatment refractory pediatric Ph(+) and TKI-resistant Ph(+) B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models better than standard-of-care dasatinib or ponatinib and provides a more durable response after treatment withdrawal. Pediatric leukemia samples with diverse genetic lesions show high sensitivity to IODVA1 ex vivo and this sensitivity is VAV3 dependent. IODVA1 thus spearheads a novel class of drugs that inhibits a RacGEF and holds promise as an anti-tumor therapy.",['(c) 2021.

Preclinical data on the anti-tumour activity of MI-773 are limited and indicate that tumour cell lines (CLs) with mutated TP53 are more resistant to MI-773 than wild type TP53. Here, we explored the compound's therapeutic potential in vitro using a panel of 274 annotated CLs derived from a diversity of tumours. MI-773 exhibited a pronounced selectivity and moderate potency, with anti-tumour activity in the sub-micromolar range in about 15% of the CLs. The most sensitive tumour types were melanoma, sarcoma, renal and gastric cancers, leukaemia, and lymphoma. A COMPARE analysis showed that the profile of MI-773 was similar to that of Nutlin-3a, the first potent inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interactions, and, in addition, had a superior potency. In contrast, it poorly correlates with profiles of compounds targeting the p53 pathway with another mechanism of action. OMICS analyses confirmed that MI-773 was primarily active in CLs with wild type TP53. In silico biomarker investigations revealed that the TP53 mutation status plus the aggregated expression levels of 11 genes involved in the p53 signalling pathway predicted sensitivity or resistance of CLs to inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interactions reliably.

The mechanisms that control these distinct effects and limit immunogenic responses to DNA-damage mediated cell death in vivo are currently unclear. Using a mouse model of BCR-ABL(+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we show that chemotherapy-induced anti-cancer immunity is suppressed by the tumor microenvironment through production of the cytokine IL-6. The chemotherapeutic doxorubicin is curative in IL-6-deficient mice through the induction of CD8(+) T-cell-mediated anti-cancer responses, while moderately extending lifespan in wild type tumor-bearing mice. We also show that IL-6 suppresses the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibition with anti-PD-L1 blockade. Our results suggest that IL-6 is a key regulator of anti-cancer immune responses induced by genotoxic stress and that its inhibition can switch cancer cell clearance from primarily apoptotic to immunogenic, promoting and maintaining durable anti-tumor immune responses.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we leveraged global metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling of primary ETP and T-ALL leukemia samples to identify specific metabolic circuitries differentially active in this high-risk leukemia group. ETP-ALLs showed increased biosynthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids, and were specifically sensitive to inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Mechanistically, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis inhibited oncogenic AKT1 signaling and suppressed MYC expression via loss of chromatin accessibility at a leukemia stem cell-specific long range MYC enhancer. In all, these results identify the mevalonate pathway as a druggable novel vulnerability in high-risk ETP-ALL cells and uncover an unanticipated critical role for cholesterol biosynthesis in signal transduction and epigenetic circuitries driving leukemia cell growth and survival.","['Copyright (c)2021, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Rashkovan, Marissa', 'Albero, Robert', 'Gianni, Francesca', 'Perez-Duran, Pablo', 'Miller, Hannah I', 'Mackey, Adam L', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Luger, Selina', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Soni, Rajesh K', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Rashkovan M', 'Albero R', 'Gianni F', 'Perez-Duran P', 'Miller HI', 'Mackey AL', 'Paietta EM', 'Tallman MS', 'Rowe JM', 'Litzow MR', 'Wiernik PH', 'Luger S', 'Sulis ML', 'Soni RK', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Montefiore Medical Center-North Division, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center and Technion.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic.', 'Cancer Research Foundation of New York.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Proteomics Core Facility, Columbia University Medical Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center af2196@columbia.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211028,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,IM,,,2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 05:48'],"['2021/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/29 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-21-0551 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-0551 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Discov. 2021 Oct 28. pii: 2159-8290.CD-21-0551. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-0551.,,,,,,,"['UG1 CA233290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6990-8186', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5527-0997', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1959-4104', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0064-6373', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4556-4358']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many different white blood cell types whose identity and function can be studied by measuring their protein expression. Therefore, high-throughput analytical instruments were developed to measure multiple proteins on millions of single cells. The information-rich biochemistry information may only be fully extracted using multivariate statistics. Here we show an overview of the most essential steps for multivariate data analysis of single cell data. We used white blood cells (immunology) as a case study, but a similar approach may be used in environment or biotech research. The first step is analyzing the study design and subsequently formulating a research question. The three main designs are immunophenotyping (finding different cell types), cell activation and rare cell discovery. When preparing the data it is essential to consider the design and focus on the cell type of interest by removing all unwanted events. After pre-processing, the ten-thousands to millions of single cells per sample need to be converted into a cellular distribution. For immunophenotyping a clustering method such as Self-Organizing Maps is useful and for cell activation a model that describes the covariance such as Principal Component Analysis is useful. In rare cell discovery it is useful to first model all common cells and remove them to find the rare cells. Finally discriminant analysis based on the cellular distribution may highlight which cell (sub)types are different between groups.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although pericardial metastasis from infradiaphragmatic tumors (such as colon cancers) are rare and poorly described in literature, any neoplasm has the potential to metastasize to the pericardium and heart by either contiguity, lymphatic, or hematological spread. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old previously healthy male Causasian patient had a sudden onset of dyspnea and wheezing. During investigation with echocardiogram, computed tomography and repeated pericardiocentesis, the cause of malignant pericardial effusion was confirmed as primary manifestation of metastatic colon cancer.

There is a need for increased knowledge on the heritability of multiple primary cancers and genotype-phenotype correlations. We have performed whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) in ten individuals with three or more primary tumours, with no previous findings on standard clinical genetic investigations. In one individual with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, a likely pathogenic cryptic splice site variant was detected in the MEN1 gene. The variant (c.654C > A) is synonymous but we showed in a cDNA analysis that it affects splicing and leads to a frameshift, with the theoretical new amino acid sequence p.(Gly219Glufs*13). In one individual with metachronous colorectal cancers, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, we found a likely pathogenic variant in the MLH1 gene (c.27G > A), and two risk factor variants in the genes CHEK2 and HOXB13. The MLH1 variant is synonymous but has previously been shown to be associated to constitutional low-grade hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter, and segregates with disease in families with colorectal and endometrial cancer. No pathogenic single nucleotide or structural variants were detected in the remaining eight individuals in the study. The pathogenic variants found by WGS/WES were in genes already sequenced by Sanger sequencing and WES in the clinic, without any findings. We conclude that, in individuals with an unequivocal clinical diagnosis of a specific hereditary cancer syndrome, where standard clinical testing failed to detect a causative variant, re-analysis may lead to a diagnosis.",['(c) 2021.

To date, attempts to define the characteristics of in vivo resistant blasts have focused on comparisons between leukemic cells at presentation and relapse. However, further treatment responses are often seen following relapse, suggesting that most blasts remain chemosensitive. We sought to characterise in vivo chemoresistant blasts by studying the transcriptional and genetic features of blasts from before and shortly after induction chemotherapy using paired samples from six patients with primary refractory AML. METHODS: Leukemic blasts were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), targeted genetic sequencing and detailed immunophenotypic analysis were used to confirm that sorted cells were leukemic. Sorted blasts were subjected to RNA sequencing. Lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs were used to assess the effect of FOXM1 knockdown on colony forming capacity, proliferative capacity and apoptosis in cell lines, primary AML cells and CD34+ cells from healthy donors. RESULTS: Molecular genetic analysis revealed early clonal selection occurring after induction chemotherapy. Immunophenotypic characterisation found leukemia-associated immunophenotypes in all cases that persisted following treatment. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of the leukemias studied, transcriptional analysis found concerted changes in gene expression in resistant blasts. Remarkably, the gene expression signature suggested that post-chemotherapy blasts were more proliferative than those at presentation. Resistant blasts also appeared less differentiated and expressed leukemia stem cell (LSC) maintenance genes. However, the proportion of immunophenotypically defined LSCs appeared to decrease following treatment, with implications for the targeting of these cells on the basis of cell surface antigen expression. The refractory gene signature was highly enriched with targets of the transcription factor FOXM1. shRNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that the viability of primary AML cells, but not normal CD34+ cells, depended on FOXM1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We found that chemorefractory blasts from leukemias with varied genetic backgrounds expressed a common transcriptional program. In contrast to the notion that LSC quiescence confers resistance to chemotherapy we find that refractory blasts are both actively proliferating and enriched with LSC maintenance genes. Using primary patient material from a relevant clinical context we also provide further support for the role of FOXM1 in chemotherapy resistance, proliferation and stem cell function in AML.",['(c) 2021.

In tumor cells the overexpression of peptides and their receptors is known and new therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer have been suggested. The overexpression of the neurotensinergic system has been associated with poor prognosis, tumor size, higher tumor aggressiveness, increased relapse risk and worse sensitivity to chemotherapy agents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to update the findings regarding the involvement of the neurotensinergic system in cancer to suggest anticancer therapeutic strategies targeting this system. The neurotensin (NT) precursor, NT and its receptors (NTR) and the involvement of the neurotensinergic system in lung, breast, prostate, gastric, colon, liver and pancreatic cancers, glioblastoma, neuroendocrine tumors and B-cell leukemia will be mentioned and discussed as well as the signaling pathways mediated by NT. Some research lines to be developed in the future will be suggested such as: molecules regulating the expression of the NT precursor, influence of the diet in the development of tumors, molecules and signaling pathways activated by NT and antitumor therapeutic strategies targeting the neurotensinergic system. CONCLUSION: NT, via the NTR, exerts oncogenic (tumor cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis) and antiapoptotic effects, whereas NTR antagonists inhibit these effects. NTR expression can be used as a diagnostic tool/therapeutic target and the administration of NTR antagonists as antitumor drugs could be a therapeutic strategy to treat tumors overexpressing NTR.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Sanchez, Manuel Lisardo', 'Covenas, Rafael']","['Sanchez ML', 'Covenas R']","['University of Salamanca, Laboratory of Neuroanatomy of the Peptidergic Systems (Lab. 14), Institute of Neurosciences of Castilla y Leon (INCYL), Salamanca.

This cross-sectional study collected data from parents of children who had been diagnosed with leukemia within the previous three months (N = 130; 57 fathers (43.8%) and 73 mothers (56.2%), age (Mean = 37.5, SD = 8.4)). The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form was used. Similarly, parents' coping approaches were assessed with the Coping Health Inventory for Parents. Parents' mean total stress and coping strategies scores were 108 (+/- 26.8) and 93.9 (+/- 15.6), respectively. There were significant negative relationships between parents' stress levels and age (r = -0.46, p = .01), education level (f = 28.5, p < .05), and income (r = -0.65, p = .01). Additionally, there were significant positive relationships between parents' coping strategies and age (r = 0.34, p = .01) and income (r = 0.53, p < .01). There were non-significant differences between fathers' and mothers' stress levels and coping strategies. Parents of children with leukemia experienced high stress. The findings also confirmed the negative relationship between parents' stress, age, education level, and income; and the positive relationship between parents' coping strategies, age, and income. Several strategies are needed to manage said stress; for example, respite care for parents who spend long hours at the hospital.

Here, we sought to evaluate the effects of the hydroalcoholic extract from V. ashei leaves (Bluegem cultivar, VAB) in T-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The VAB extract was toxic to T-ALL cells at the approximately 60 microg/ml concentration. T-ALL cell death occurred through apoptosis. VAB extract was found to induce micronuclei formation, p53 pathway activation, and cell cycle arrest. Those mutagenic effects were evidenced through microscopy analysis and molecular p53 pathway activation. A series of phenolic compounds were identified in VAB extract by mass spectrometry, such as vanillic acid, catechin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, rutin, coumaric acid, taxifolin, quercetin and naringenin, some of which are presumed to induce DNA damage.

Thus, we have examined the serum levels of these chemokines in parallel with their related cognate receptors (CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR4) in AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients prior and post BMT (bone marrow transplantation) therapy. MAIN METHODS: Clinical specimens were collected from 46 AML patients (23 M1 and 23 M3 subtypes) before/after BMT. CXCL1, CXCL10 and CXCL12 concentrations were determined by ELISA. The mRNA levels of the related receptors were detected by QRT_PCR. Data were analyzed by T-test, chi2 and ANOVA statistical methods in SPSS software version 18. A difference was regarded significant if P value < 0.05. KEY FINDINGS: Our results indicated that the elevated levels of CXCL12 in AML patients were remained unchanged after transplantation. The CXCL10 concentration was decreased in patients. All studied chemokines were elevated in BMT patients with history of 9 times PLT transfusion. In patients who received BMT from siblings CXCL1 and CXCL10 have been elevated, whereby they were compared to patients who received BMT from parents while CXCL12 sustained unchanged in groups. Serum measures of CXCL1 and CXCL10 were induced in acute and chronic GVHD patients in compare to these without GVHD. SIGNIFICANCE: According to the results, it can be concluded that these chemokines play fundamental parts in pathogenesis of both AML and BMT.

Asparaginase antibody production may cause a subtherapeutic level and result in an inferior outcome. The aim of this study was to prove the efficacy of current native E.coli asparaginase-based protocol. Moreover, does subtherapeutic result appeared in small group of the trial?. METHODS: A prospective study of asparaginase activity among patients who received native E.coli asparaginase 10,000 IU/m2 intramuscularly according to The Thai Pediatric Oncology Group (ThaiPOG) protocol was done. The plasma asparaginase activity was measured by the coupled enzymatic reaction. Pharmacokinetic data including peak activity (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC0-48h) being elucidated. RESULTS: Eight patients (five males and three females), median age 9.5 years, were enrolled. The median asparaginase activity of seven cases who were eligible for calculation reached Tmax within 24 hours (range 6-48 hours) with mean+/-SD of Cmax 3.60+/-0.34 (range 3.02-4.11) IU/ml. Mean+/-SD of AUC0-48h is 143.23+/-36.94 IU.h/mL (range 71.07 - 180.12 IU.h/mL). The post-48-hour activity showed a mean+/-SD of 3.19+/-0.24 IU/ml (range 2.77-3.51 IU/ml) which implied an adequacy of activity over 48 hours and proper for the 12-day period. One relapsed ALL patient showed an extremely low AUC of asparaginase activity which coincided with urticaria after asparaginase injection. Subsequently, the asparaginase antibody was demonstrated in this patient. CONCLUSION: Native E. coli asparaginase-based protocol provides a compelling pharmacokinetic effect. Asparaginase activity and/or antibody testing is recommended for all cases especially in a relapsed patient, history of high accumulative dose of asparaginase or suspected allergic reaction. Patients with low asparaginase activity or allergy may benefit from switching to an alternative form of asparaginase to maintain treatment efficacy.",,"['Chaweephisal, Phumin', 'Tharnpanich, Trai', 'Suroengrit, Aphinya', 'Aungbamnet, Pattramon', 'Seksarn, Panya', 'Sosothikul, Darintr', 'Lauhasurayotin, Supanun', 'Chiengthong, Kanhatai', 'Poparn, Hansamon', 'Techavichit, Piti']","['Chaweephisal P', 'Tharnpanich T', 'Suroengrit A', 'Aungbamnet P', 'Seksarn P', 'Sosothikul D', 'Lauhasurayotin S', 'Chiengthong K', 'Poparn H', 'Techavichit P']","['Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211001,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allergy', '*asparaginase', '*native', '*pharmacokinetic', '*silent inactivation']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 01:37'],"['2021/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 01:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.10.3309 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Oct 1;22(10):3309-3315. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.10.3309.,22,10,3309-3315,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1888-1446'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, FLT3/ITD mutations are frequently accompanied with leukocytosis, high percentage of blasts in bone marrow (BM), and increased the risk of treatment failure in AML patients. FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients mainly with normal karyotype have higher relapse probability and shorter duration of complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy, so FLT3-ITD mutation is considered as an independent poor prognostic factor in AML. METHODS: FLT3-ITD and FLT3-KTD were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism- PCR (RFLP-PCR) in 44 adults AML patients with cytogenetically normal karyotype (AML-CN) at diagnosis to characterize FLT3 status. The results were correlated with the prognostic factors. RESULTS: In this study, FLT3-ITD mutations were identified in 7 (15.9%) of the 44 AML-CN patients. Among the 7 patients with FLT3/ITD mutations, 6 patients revealed a typical ITDs mutation (fragment size was 329 bp) and one patient showed untypical ITD mutation (fragment size was ~400 bp). Whereas 37 patients (61.7%) were FLT3-ITD. None of all AML-CN patients examined showed FLT3-KTD mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that FLT3-ITD are independent adverse prognostic factors for elderly AML-CN patients and are associated with low overall survival (OS), low rate of CR, high relapse rate (RR), and high percentage of BM blast at diagnosis.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the CD34+/CD38- stem cells (SCs) burden in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on treatment response and patients' outcomes. METHODS: Our study included 65 CML patients in the chronic phase. The patients' CD34+/CD38- stem cells were quantified using flowcytometry before and after treatment by frontline imatinib (IM) therapy. The median follow-up for all patients was 18 months. RESULTS: CD34+/CD38- stem cells frequency at diagnosis and after therapies are correlated to known prognostic markers (blast cells count, spleen size, total White cell count, and clinical scores). After therapy, the leukemic stem cells count dropped rapidly. The pretreatment CD34+/CD38- stem cells burden predicts response to frontline therapy. In addition, high SCs frequency at diagnosis predicts poor molecular response, transformation to AML, and poor patients' outcomes. CONCLUSION: The percentage of CD34+/CD38- SCs burden at diagnosis reflects the CML disease behavior and is considered a biomarker for predicting CML patients' response to first-line Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy.",,"['Fathy El-Metwaly, Noura', 'Aref, Salah', 'Ayed, Mohamed', 'Abdel Hamid, Manal', 'El-Sokkary, Ahmed M A']","['Fathy El-Metwaly N', 'Aref S', 'Ayed M', 'Abdel Hamid M', 'El-Sokkary AMA']","['Biochemistry Subdivision, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science; Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Mansoura University Oncology Center (MUOC), Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Subdivision, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science; Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211001,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'outcome', 'stem cells']",2021/10/30 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/10/29 01:37'],"['2021/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 01:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.10.3237 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Oct 1;22(10):3237-3243. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.10.3237.,22,10,3237-3243,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4822-5204'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM -CSF) has been proved to be effective in promoting lymphocyte regeneration, but adverse immunological effects have also emerged. This study aim to investigate the effect of GM -CSF on BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire while promoting lymphocyte regeneration. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and GM -CSF were used to inhibit and stimulate bone marrow hematopoiesis, respectively. High throughput sequencing was applied to detect the characteristics of BCR CDR3 repertoire in controls, CTX group and GM -CSF group. The white blood cells (WBCs) were quickly reduced (P < 0.05) with lymphocytes decreasing causing by CTX, and the WBCs and lymphocytes returned to the level of controls after GM -CSF treatment. The diversity of BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire was also significantly decreased in CTX group. Although there is still a big gap from the controls, the diversity was picked up after GM -CSF treatment. The expression of IGHD01-01, IGHD02-14 and IGHJ04-01 with high-frequency usage regularly and significantly changed in three groups, and many genes with low-frequency usage lost in CTX group and did not reappear in GM -CSF group. Moreover, two shared sequences and accounted for the highest proportion in GM -CSF group have been detected in animal model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These results revealed that GM -CSF can partially restore changes in the BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire while promoting lymphocyte regeneration, but it may also lead to rearrangement, proliferation and activation of abnormal B cells, which can provide a basis for further study on the adverse immunological effects and mechanism of GM -CSF treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Despite initial efficacy, short duration of response and high relapse rates limit clinical use of selective FLT3 inhibitors. Combination approaches with other targeted therapies may achieve better clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-leukemic activity of multikinase inhibitor olverembatinib (HQP1351), alone or in combination with BCL-2 inhibitor lisaftoclax (APG-2575), was evaluated in FLT3-ITD mutant AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. A patient-derived FLT3-ITD mutant AML xenograft model was also used to assess the anti-leukemic activity of this combination. RESULTS: HQP1351 potently induced apoptosis and inhibited FLT3 signaling in FLT3-ITD mutant AML cell lines MV-4-11 and MOLM-13. HQP1351 monotherapy also significantly suppressed growth of FLT3-ITD mutant AML xenograft tumors and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. HQP1351 and APG-2575 synergistically induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD mutant AML cells and suppressed growth of MV-4-11 xenograft tumors. Combination therapy improved survival of tumor bearing-mice in a systemic MOLM-13 model and showed synergistic anti-leukemic effects in a patient-derived FLT3-ITD mutant AML xenograft model. Mechanistically, HQP1351 downregulated expression of myeloid-cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) by suppressing FLT3-STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) signaling and thus enhanced APG-2575-induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD mutant AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3 inhibition by HQP1351 downregulates MCL-1 and synergizes with BCL-2 inhibitor APG-2575 to potentiate cellular apoptosis in FLT3-ITD mutant AML. Our findings provide a scientific rationale for further clinical investigation of HQP1351 combined with APG-2575 in patients with FLT3-ITD mutant AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of HCL is based on morphological evidence of hairy cells, an HCL immunologic score of 3 or 4 based on the CD11C, CD103, CD123, and CD25 expression, the trephine biopsy which makes it possible to specify the degree of tumoral medullary infiltration and the presence of BRAF(V600E) somatic mutation. RISK STRATIFICATION: Progression of patients with HCL is based on a large splenomegaly, leukocytosis, a high number of hairy cells in the peripheral blood, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene mutational status. VH4-34-positive HCL cases are associated with a poor prognosis. TREATMENT: Patients should be treated only if HCL is symptomatic. Chemotherapy with risk adapted therapy purine analogs (PNAs) are indicated in first-line HCL patients. The use of chemo-immunotherapy combining PNAs and rituximab (R) represents an increasingly used therapeutic approach. Management of relapsed/refractory disease is based on the use of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) plus rituximab or MEK inhibitors (MEKi), recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22 or Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi). However, the optimal sequence of the different treatments remains to be determined.

The mainstay therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) but there has been no innovation in cytoreductive regimens. CPX-351, a fixed 5:1 molar ratio of liposomal cytarabine/daunorubicin, has shown favorable safety and efficacy in elderly individuals with sAML and children with relapsed de novo AML. We report the outcomes of seven young patients (six with newly diagnosed sMDS/AML and one with primary MDS/AML) uniformly treated with CPX-351. Five patients had previously received chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, or T-ALL; one had predisposing genomic instability disorder (Cornelia de Lange); and one MDS-related AML and multi-organ failure. The median age at diagnosis of myeloid malignancy was 17 (13-23) years. Patients received 1-3 cycles of CPX-351 (cytarabine 100mg/m2 plus daunorubicin 44mg/m2) on days 1, 3, and 5, resulting in complete morphologic remission without overt toxicity or treatment-related mortality. This approach allowed for adding FLT3 inhibitor as individualized therapy in one patient. Six patients were alive and leukemia-free at 0.5-3.3 years after HCT. One patient died from disease progression before HCT.

With all patients off treatment for at least three years, we report a detailed analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics and long-term outcome of patients treated in the CLL14 study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of obinutuzumab with 12 cycles of venetoclax or 12 cycles of chlorambucil (Clb-Obi). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Key secondary end points included rates of undetectable MRD and overall survival. To analyze MRD kinetics, a population-based growth model with nonlinear mixed effects approach was developed. RESULTS: Of 432 patients, 216 were assigned to Ven-Obi and 216 to Clb-Obi. Three months after treatment completion, 40% of patients in the Ven-Obi arm (7% in the Clb-Obi arm) had undetectable MRD levels < 10(-6) by next-generation sequencing in peripheral blood. Median MRD doubling time was longer after Ven-Obi than Clb-Obi therapy (median 80 v 69 days). At a median follow-up of 52.4 months, a sustained significant PFS improvement was observed in the Ven-Obi arm compared with Clb-Obi (median not reached v 36.4 months; hazard ratio 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.45; P < .0001). The estimated 4-year PFS rate was 74.0% in the Ven-Obi and 35.4% in the Clb-Obi arm. No difference in overall survival was observed (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.35; P = .49). No new safety signals occurred. CONCLUSION: Appearance of MRD after Ven-Obi is significantly slower than that after Clb-Obi with more effective MRD reduction.

These cells are relatively quiescent and therefore treatment resistant. Understanding mechanisms underlying their maintenance is critical for effective MDS treatment. METHODS: We evaluated microRNA-126 (miR-126) levels in MDS patients' sample and in a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) murine MDS model along with their normal controls and defined its role in MDS HSPCs' maintenance by inhibiting miR-126 expression in vitro and in vivo. Identification of miR-126 effectors was conducted using biotinylated miR-126 pulldown coupled with transcriptome analysis. We also tested the therapeutic activity of our anti-miR-126 oligodeoxynucleotide (miRisten) in human MDS xenografts and murine MDS models. RESULTS: miR-126 levels were higher in bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS patients and NHD13 mice relative to their respective normal controls (P < 0.001). Genetic deletion of miR-126 in NHD13 mice decreased quiescence and self-renewal capacity of MDS HSPCs, and alleviated MDS symptoms of NHD13 mice. Ex vivo exposure to miRisten increased cell cycling, reduced colony-forming capacity, and enhanced apoptosis in human MDS HSPCs, but spared normal human HSPCs. In vivo miRisten administration partially reversed pancytopenia in NHD13 mice and blocked the leukemic transformation (combination group vs DAC group, P < 0.0001). Mechanistically, we identified the non-coding RNA PTTG3P as a novel miR-126 target. Lower PTTG3P levels were associated with a shorter overall survival in MDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-126 plays crucial roles in MDS HSPC maintenance. Therapeutic targeting of miR-126 is a potentially novel approach in MDS.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been verified to play important regulatory roles in AML progression. However, the role and molecular mechanism of circ_0009910 in AML development have not be completely clarified. METHODS: The expression levels of circ_0009910, microRNA-491-5p (miR-491-5p), and beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase 5 (B4GALT5) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or Western blot. Cell proliferation and self-renewal ability were assessed via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and sphere formation assay. Cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activity was tested by Caspase-3 Activity Assay Kit. Western blot was used to examine the protein levels of autophagy-related markers and PI3K/AKT pathway-related markers. The interaction between miR-491-5p and circ_0009910 or B4GALT5 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, or RNA pull-down assay. RESULTS: Circ_0009910 was highly expressed in AML tissues and cells. Silenced circ_0009910 could significantly inhibit the proliferation, sphere formation, and autophagy and promoted the apoptosis of AML cells. Circ_0009910 bound to miR-491-5p in AML cells, and circ_0009910 promoted AML progression partly through sponging miR-491-5p in vitro. B4GALT5 was a target of miR-491-5p, and miR-491-5p overexpression-mediated influences in AML cells were effectually overturned by the addition of B4GALT5 overexpression plasmid. Furthermore, circ_0009910 could regulate the expression of B4GALT5 by downregulating miR-491-5p in AML cells. Additionally, circ_0009910 could activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by sponging miR-491-5p. CONCLUSION: Circ_0009910 could suppress the proliferation, sphere formation, and autophagy and accelerated apoptosis by modulating B4GALT5 expression and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via sponging miR-491-5p in AML cells, suggesting that circ_0009910 might be a potential biomarker for the treatment of AML.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wu, Yingwei', 'Zhao, Bo', 'Chen, Xianghua', 'Geng, Xueli', 'Zhang, Zhihua']","['Wu Y', 'Zhao B', 'Chen X', 'Geng X', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211028,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT pathway', 'AML', 'B4GALT5', 'PI3K', 'circ_0009910', 'miR-491-5p']",2021/10/29 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/10/28 12:42'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/28 12:42 [entrez]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13742 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Oct 28. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13742.,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4497-1178'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supportive care guidelines recommend hospitalization until neutrophil recovery. However, there are little data to support inpatient over outpatient management. Objective: To evaluate outpatient vs inpatient neutropenia management for pediatric AML. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used qualitative and quantitative methods to compare medical outcomes, patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and patient and family perceptions between outpatient and inpatient neutropenia management. The study included patients from 17 US pediatric hospitals with frontline chemotherapy start dates ranging from January 2011 to July 2019, although the specific date ranges differed for the individual analyses by design and relative timing. Data were analyzed from August 2019 to February 2020. Exposures: Discharge to outpatient vs inpatient neutropenia management. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes of interest were course-specific bacteremia incidence, times to next course, and patient HRQOL. Course-specific mortality was a secondary medical outcome. Results: Primary quantitative analyses included 554 patients (272 [49.1%] girls and 282 [50.9%] boys; mean [SD] age, 8.2 [6.1] years). Bacteremia incidence was not significantly different during outpatient vs inpatient management (67 courses [23.8%] vs 265 courses [29.0%]; adjusted rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.06; P = .08). Outpatient management was not associated with delays to the next course compared with inpatient management (mean [SD] 30.7 [12.2] days vs 32.8 [9.7] days; adjusted mean difference, -2.2; 95% CI, -4.1 to -0.2, P = .03). Mortality during intensification II was higher for patients who received outpatient management compared with those who received inpatient management (3 patients [5.4%] vs 1 patient [0.5%]; P = .03), but comparable with inpatient management at other courses (eg, 0 patients vs 5 patients [1.3%] during induction I; P = .59). Among 97 patients evaluated for HRQOL, outcomes did not differ between outpatient and inpatient management (mean [SD] Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory total score, 70.1 [18.9] vs 68.7 [19.4]; adjusted mean difference, -2.8; 95% CI, -11.2 to 5.6). A total of 86 respondents (20 [23.3%] in outpatient management, 66 [76.7%] in inpatient management) completed qualitative interviews. Independent of management strategy received, 74 respondents (86.0%) expressed satisfaction with their experience. Concerns for hospital-associated infections among caregivers (6 of 7 caregiver respondents [85.7%] who were dissatisfied with inpatient management) and family separation (2 of 2 patient respondents [100%] who were dissatisfied with inpatient management) drove dissatisfaction with inpatient management. Stress of caring for a neutropenic child at home (3 of 3 respondents [100%] who were dissatisfied with outpatient management) drove dissatisfaction with outpatient management. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that outpatient neutropenia management was not associated with higher bacteremia incidence, treatment delays, or worse HRQOL compared with inpatient neutropenia management among pediatric patients with AML. While outpatient management may be safe for many patients, course-specific mortality differences suggest that outpatient management in intensification II should be approached with caution. Patient and family experiences varied, suggesting that outpatient management may be preferred by some but may not be feasible for all families. Further studies to refine and standardize safe outpatient management practices are warranted.",,"['Getz, Kelly D', 'Szymczak, Julia E', 'Li, Yimei', 'Madding, Rachel', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Aftandilian, Catherine', 'Arnold, Staci D', 'Bona, Kira O', 'Caywood, Emi', 'Collier, Anderson B', 'Gramatges, M Monica', 'Henry, Meret', 'Lotterman, Craig', 'Maloney, Kelly', 'Mian, Amir', 'Mody, Rajen', 'Morgan, Elaine', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Verma, Anupam', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Wilkes, Jennifer J', 'Yu, Jennifer C', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Getz KD', 'Szymczak JE', 'Li Y', 'Madding R', 'Huang YV', 'Aftandilian C', 'Arnold SD', 'Bona KO', 'Caywood E', 'Collier AB', 'Gramatges MM', 'Henry M', 'Lotterman C', 'Maloney K', 'Mian A', 'Mody R', 'Morgan E', 'Raetz EA', 'Rubnitz J', 'Verma A', 'Winick N', 'Wilkes JJ', 'Yu JC', 'Fisher BT', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.', ""Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'A.I.

We investigated impacts of MYCN on sensitization of AML cell to cisplatin, and its interaction with SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4). In vitro, human AML cell lines HL60 and KG-1 were transfected with the overexpression plasmids and specific small interfering RNA of MYCN (siMYCN), or siSOX4, and then treated with 2 mug/mL cisplatin. MTT and flow cytometry assays were performed to estimate the viability and apoptosis of AML cell. The expressions of MYCN and SOX4 in AML patients and the associations between these two were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assay and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In vivo, transfected HL60 cells were injected into BALB/c nude mice. The tumor size and weight were recorded, and the expressions of MYCN and SOX4 were determined with immunohistochemistry. MYCY and SOX4 were highly-expressed in AML, and their expressions were positively correlated. In AML cells, the treatment using cisplatin induced higher MYCN expression and augmented apoptosis, whereas decreasing the viability. Silencing of MYCN enhanced the tumor-suppressive effects of cisplatin on AML by decreasing cell viability and increasing apoptosis. The promoter of SOX4 was targeted by MYCN. Lower cell viability and higher apoptosis rate were seen in AML cells transfected with siSOX4, the effects of which were partially reversed by overexpressed MYCN. Silencing of MYCN retarded the tumor growth and SOX4 expression in tumor in vivo.

METHODS: All patients newly diagnosed with AML were included in this cohort study. LDH was measured for the first time after admission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between serum LDH and 60-day mortality. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted including age, sex, albumin, glucose, myoglobin, and standard chemotherapy. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-one patients >/=15 years of age, who were newly diagnosed with AML, were consecutively selected. The total prevalence of 60-day mortality was 27.2% (101/371), while it was 32.1% (42/131) and higher than in the LDH >/=570U/L compared with the LDH<570U/L, with the prevalence of 24.6% (59/240); however, the difference was not statistically significant. In multivariate regression models, odd ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for Log2 and twice limit of normal (ULN) of LDH were 1.46 (1.0, 2.14) and 2.76 (1.24, 6.16), respectively. Interaction analysis revealed no interactive role in the association between LDH concentration and 60-day mortality.

Material and Methods: Antiproliferative activity was carried out by MTT assay and apoptosis inducing activity was performed by DAPI and Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Molecular docking studies were performed using AutoDock Tools 1.5.6. Pharmacokinetics properties like ADME and toxicity were analysed by pkCSM web server. Result: In this study, four new sydnone compounds 3-(4-nonylbiphenyl-4'-yl) sydnone (MC-182), 3-(4-propylbiphenyl-4'-yl) sydnone (MC-454), 3-(4-hexylbiphenyl-4'-yl) sydnone (MC-433), and 3-(4-methylbiphenyl-4'-yl) sydnone (MC-431) were screened for antiproliferative and apoptotic effect against BT-474 (human breast cancer), HeLa (human cervical cancer) and Jurkat (human myeloid leukemia) Mostly, all the sydnone compounds exhibited decent antiproliferative effectiveness, but compound MC-431, MC-433, and MC-454 showed more antiproliferative activity (IC50 1.71, 10.09 and 2.87 muM against BT-474, Hela and Jurkat cell line, respectively). The changes of morphological characteristics of cancer cells determined by staining techniques indicate the apoptotic cell death. The molecular docking and interaction studies were carried out between sydnones with cancer proteins (epidermal growth factor domain receptor tyrosine kinase [EGF-TK], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] and Caspase3. Among all four sydnone molecules, two compounds MC-454 and MC-431 showed good binding energy with targeted proteins. Drug-like property was predicted by ADME toxicity study. Conclusion: The results indicate sydnone compounds were found to exhibit anticancer activity by inducing apoptosis. The molecular docking study of sydnones with cancer proteins showed a decent interaction affinity. The results of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity studies by the Insilco approach also proved that MC-454 sydnone showed better In-Vivo administration.

In pediatric bone marrow transplant (BMT), one of the biggest challenges was determining how and when to transplant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 while mitigating the risks of COVID-related complications. METHODS: Our joint adult and pediatric BMT program developed protocols for performing BMT during the pandemic, including guidelines for screening and isolation. For patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the general recommendation was to delay BMT for at least 14 days from the start of infection and until symptoms improved and the patient twice tested negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, delaying BMT in patients with malignancy increases the risk of relapse. RESULTS: We opted to transplant two SARS-CoV-2 persistently PCR positive patients with leukemia at high risk of relapse. One patient passed away early post-BMT of a transplant-related complication. The other patient is currently in remission and doing well. CONCLUSION: These cases demonstrate that when the risk associated with delaying BMT is high, it may be reasonable to proceed to transplant in pediatric leukemia patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Krajewski, Jennifer', 'Chen, Jing', 'Motiani, Juhi', 'Baer, Aryeh', 'Appel, Burton', 'Zakrzewski, Johannes', 'Hankewycz, Melanie', 'Durning, Nancy', 'Gillio, Alfred']","['Krajewski J', 'Chen J', 'Motiani J', 'Baer A', 'Appel B', 'Zakrzewski J', 'Hankewycz M', 'Durning N', 'Gillio A']","['Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211027,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['HSCT', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'infectious risk', 'pediatrics']",2021/10/29 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/10/28 06:58'],"['2021/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/28 06:58 [entrez]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/petr.14179 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Transplant. 2021 Oct 27:e14179. doi: 10.1111/petr.14179.,,,e14179,,,PMC8646710,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6226-965X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the extensive and in-depth studies on this gene therapy vehicle over the past two decades, LVs have been widely used in both research and clinical trials. For instance, third-generation and self-inactive LVs have been used to introduce a gene with therapeutic potential into the host genome and achieve targeted delivery into specific tissue. When LVs are employed in leukemia, the transduced T cells recognize and kill the tumor B cells; in beta-thalassemia, the transduced CD34(+) cells express normal beta-globin; in adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency, the autologous CD34(+) cells express adenosine deaminase and realize immune reconstitution. Overall, LVs can perform significant roles in the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases, hemoglobinopathies, B cell leukemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the recent developments and therapeutic applications of LVs. The safe and efficient LVs show great promise as a tool for human gene therapy.","['(c) 2021.

We used peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with AML to analyse the impact of CD157-directed antibodies in AML survival and in response to cytarabine (AraC) ex vivo. The study was extended to the U937, THP1 and OCI-AML3 AML cell lines of which we engineered CD157-low versions by shRNA knockdown. CD157-targeting antibodies enhanced survival, decreased apoptosis and reduced AraC toxicity in AML blasts and cell lines. CD157 signaling activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways and increased expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL anti-apoptotic proteins, while decreasing expression of Bax pro-apoptotic protein, thus preventing Caspase-3 activation. The primary CD157-mediated anti-apoptotic mechanism was Bak sequestration by Mcl-1. Indeed, the Mcl-1-specific inhibitor S63845 restored apoptosis by disrupting the interaction of Mcl-1 with Bim and Bak and significantly increased AraC toxicity in CD157-high but not in CD157-low AML cells. This study provides a new role for CD157 in AML cell survival, and indicates a potential role of CD157 as a predictive marker of response to therapies exploiting Mcl-1 pharmacological inhibition.",['(c) 2021.

To assess the effectiveness of antimicrobials prophylaxis, antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria, and exposure of antimicrobials during intensive chemotherapy for AML patients, 90 consecutive de novo AML patients aged 0-18 years between January 1, 1997 and March 31, 2018 were enrolled. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and voriconazole prophylaxis was administered from January 1, 2010. During the preprophylaxis period, January 1997 to December 2009, 62 patients experienced a total of 87 episodes of bloodstream infection (BSI) and 17 episodes of invasive fungal infection (IFI) among 502 courses of chemotherapy. In contrast, 16 episodes of BSI occurred and no IFIs were reported to occur in 28 patients who received 247 courses of chemotherapy in the prophylaxis period. Patients who received antimicrobial prophylaxis had a significant reduction of BSI, IFI, and febrile neutropenia in comparison with patients without prophylaxis. Exposure to amikacin, carbapenem, amphotericin B was reduced in the prophylaxis period. Imipenem susceptibility of Enterobacter cloacae as well as vancomycin susceptibility of Enterococcus species were reduced in the prophylaxis period. At the time of the last follow up, patients with prophylaxis had a better subsequent 5-year overall survival rate than those without prophylaxis.

The development of targeted drugs has been pioneered with compounds against gene products of fusion genes caused by chromosomal translocations. While polysomies are equally frequent as translocations, for many of them we are lacking therapeutic approaches aimed at synthetic lethality. Here, we report two new cell lines, named MBU-7 and MBU-8, that differ in complete trisomy of chromosome18, a partial trisomy of chromosome 7 and a tetrasomy of the p-arm of chromosome 8, but otherwise share the same mutational pattern and complex karyotype. Both cell lines are divergent clones of U-937 cells and have the morphology and immunoprofile of monocytic cells. The distinct karyotypic differences between MBU-7 and MBU-8 are associated with a difference in the specific response to nucleoside analogues. Taken together, we propose the MBU-7 and MBU-8 cell lines described here as suitable in vitro models for screening and testing vulnerabilities that are associated with the disease-relevant polysomies of chromosome 7, 8 and 18.",['(c) 2021.

However, its efficacy can be impaired by insufficient numbers of donor HSCs. A promising strategy to overcome this hurdle is the use of an advanced ex vivo culture system that supports the proliferation and, at the same time, maintains the pluripotency of HSCs. Therefore, we have developed artificial 3D bone marrow-like scaffolds made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that model the natural HSC niche in vitro. These 3D PDMS scaffolds in combination with an optimized HSC culture medium allow the amplification of high numbers of undifferentiated HSCs. After 14 days in vitro cell culture, we performed transcriptome and proteome analysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that the 3D PDMS cell culture scaffolds altered PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways and activated SREBP, HIF1alpha and FOXO signaling, leading to metabolic adaptations, as judged by ELISA, Western blot and metabolic flux analysis.

Therefore, any lack or decrease in CD79a expression makes the diagnosis of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases very challenging, especially in developing country laboratories where flow cytometry analyses are not always available and, when they are, they are limited in the number of markers used for lineage assignment. Since this case is potentially interesting, we report a B acute lymphoblastic leukemia case with a lack of expression CD79a associated with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 genetic abnormality. We further discuss the practical challenges in the diagnosis of this case. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of an 8-year-old Caucasian boy from eastern Morocco who was initially hospitalized for a hemorrhagic syndrome. Peripheral blood smear examination showed a significant number of blasts suggesting acute leukemia. Bone marrow was studied for morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics. Flow cytometry analyses showed expression of CD19, CD22, CD10, CD34, and HLA-DR markers by leukemic blasts. The expression of CD79a, which was checked with two different monoclonal antibodies, confirms that this marker was severely decreased in this case. Cytogenetic study performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the presence of intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21, a cytogenetic abnormality that is specific for B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: CD79a is one of the critical markers in the assignment of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In our case, we were lucky enough to be assisted by a few other markers of the B lineage that were positive in this case. Also, we mention the importance of proceeding to cytogenetic study, which in our case helped us to confirm the diagnosis made by flow cytometry by highlighting a cytogenetic abnormality that is specific to B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['(c) 2021.

BMFs can be acquired during bone marrow stress or innate are associated with driver genetic mutations. BMFs are at higher risks of developing secondary neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia. Despite the identification of genetic driver mutations, the hematopoietic presentation of the disease is quite heterogeneous raising the possibility that non-genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The role of inflammation has emerged as an important contributing factors, but remain to be understood in detail. In this study, we examined the effect of increased TGFbeta signaling in combination or not with an acute innate immune challenge using polyinosinc:polycytidilic acid (pIC) on the hematopoietic system without genetic mutations. We show that acute rounds of pIC alone drive a benign age-related myeloid cell expansion, increased TGFbeta signaling alone causes a modest anemia on old mice. In sharp contrast, increased TGFbeta signaling plus acute pIC challenge result in chronic pancytopenia, expanded hematopoietic stem and progenitor pools, and increased bone marrow dysplasia 3-4 months after stress, phenotypes similar to human bone marrow failure syndromes. Mechanistically, this disease phenotype is uniquely associated with increased mitochondrial content, increased reactive oxygen species and enhanced caspase-1 activity. Our results suggest that chronic increased TGFbeta signaling modifies the memory of an acute immune response to drive bone marrow failure without the need for pre-existing genetic insult. Hence, non-genetic factors in combination are sufficient to drive bone marrow failure.",,"['Javier, Jose', 'Hinge, Ashwini', 'Bartram, James', 'Xu, Juying', 'Filippi, Marie-Dominique']","['Javier J', 'Hinge A', 'Bartram J', 'Xu J', 'Filippi MD']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati OH, USA; College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cancer and Cell Biology graduate program."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati OH."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati OH, USA; College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cancer and Cell Biology graduate program."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati OH."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati OH.

A lack of understanding of the unique biology of this disease, particularly its prenatal origin, has hindered improvement of survival. We perform multiple RNA sequencing experiments on fetal, neonatal, and adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from human and mouse. This allows definition of a conserved fetal transcriptional signature characterized by a prominent proliferative and oncogenic nature that persists in infant ALL blasts. From this signature, we identify a number of genes in functional validation studies that are critical for survival of MLL-AF4+ ALL cells. Of particular interest are PLK1 because of the readily available inhibitor and ELOVL1, which highlights altered fatty acid metabolism as a feature of infant ALL.

Although survival rates are relatively high, social disparities in outcomes have been sometimes observed. In a population-based study, we investigated social inequalities by sex and deprivation in treatment receipt in childhood cancer in Ireland. Cancers incident in people aged 0 to 19 during 1994 to 2012 and treatments received were abstracted from the National Cancer Registry Ireland. Multivariable modified Poisson regression with robust error variance (adjusting for age, and year) was used to assess associations between sex and deprivation category of area of residence at diagnosis and receipt of cancer-directed surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Three thousand seven hundred and four childhood cancers were included. Girls were significantly less likely than boys to receive radiotherapy for leukemia overall (relative risk [RR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.98), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia specifically (RR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.36-0.79), and surgery for central nervous system (CNS) overall (RR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.74-0.93) and other CNS (RR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.60-0.96). Girls were slightly less likely to receive chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and surgery for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), but these results were not statistically significant. Children residing in more deprived areas were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia or surgery for lymphoma overall and HL, but more likely to receive chemotherapy for medulloblastoma. These results may suggest social inequalities in treatment receipt for childhood cancers. Further research is warranted to explore whether similar patterns are evident in other childhood cancer populations and to better understand the reasons for the findings.",['(c) 2021 UICC.'],"['Molcho, Michal', 'Thomas, Audrey A', 'Walsh, Paul M', 'Skinner, Roderick', 'Sharp, Linda']","['Molcho M', 'Thomas AA', 'Walsh PM', 'Skinner R', 'Sharp L']","['School of Education, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'School of Education, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Division of Undergraduate Education, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'National Cancer Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland.', ""Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology/Oncology, Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211027,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer epidemiology', 'cancer registry', 'cancer treatment', 'pediatric cancer']",2021/10/28 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/10/27 17:29'],"['2021/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/27 17:29 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33856 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Cancer. 2021 Oct 27. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33856.,,,,,,,['HIC15MOL/Irish Cancer Society'],,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7353-8931'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, no effective vaccine is known to combat HTLV-1, hence, the current research work was performed to design a potential multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine (MEBV) by adopting the latest methodology of reverse vaccinology. Briefly, three highly antigenic proteins (Glycoprotein, Accessory protein, and Tax protein) with no or minimal (<37%) similarity with human proteome were sorted out and potential B- and T-cell epitopes were forecasted from them. Highly antigenic, immunogenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic and overlapping epitopes were short-listed for vaccine development. The chosen T-cell epitopes displayed a strong binding affinity with their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen alleles and demonstrated 95.8% coverage of the world's population. Finally, nine Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, six Helper T Lymphocytes and five Linear B Lymphocytes epitopes, joint through linkers and adjuvant, were exploited to design the final MEBV construct, comprising of 382 amino acids. The developed MEBV structure showed highly antigenic properties while being non-toxic, soluble, non-allergenic, and stable in nature. Moreover, disulphide engineering further enhanced the stability of the final vaccine protein. Additionally, Molecular docking analysis and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the strong association between MEBV construct and human pathogenic immune receptor TLR-3. Repeated-exposure simulations and Immune simulations ensured the rapid antigen clearance and higher levels of cell-mediated immunity, respectively. Furthermore, MEBV codon optimization and in-silico cloning was carried out to confirm its augmented expression. Results of our experiments suggested that the proposed MEBV could be a potential immunogenic against HTLV-1; nevertheless, additional wet lab experiments are needed to elucidate our conclusion.",,"['Tariq, Muhammad Hamza', 'Bhatti, Rashid', 'Ali, Nida Fatima', 'Ashfaq, Usman Ali', 'Shahid, Farah', 'Almatroudi, Ahmad', 'Khurshid, Mohsin']","['Tariq MH', 'Bhatti R', 'Ali NF', 'Ashfaq UA', 'Shahid F', 'Almatroudi A', 'Khurshid M']","['Atta ur Rehman School of Applied Bioscience, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Atta ur Rehman School of Applied Bioscience, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratories, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Microbiology, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211027,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/10/28 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/10/27 17:23'],"['2021/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/27 17:23 [entrez]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0258443 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-17722 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Oct 27;16(10):e0258443. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0258443. eCollection 2021.,16,10,e0258443,20211124,"['Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', '*Molecular Docking Simulation']",PMC8550388,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1261-7481', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7971-5874', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5495-805X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1491-6402']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although children in high-income countries enjoy survival rates of ~90%, children in countries with limited resources suffer from survival rates of <35%. No published data on pediatric cancer incidence, management, or outcomes in the Gaza Strip are available. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken for pediatric (below 12 y of age) ALL diagnoses admitted to the only pediatric cancer ward in the Gaza Strip between 2010 and 2015. Outcomes included event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Events were defined as induction failure, relapse, and death. RESULTS: The 3-year EFS estimate was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66%-89%). The EFS at 1 and 3 years for high-risk ALL was 55% (95% CI, 27%-76%) and 23% (95% CI, 4%-51%), respectively. The 3-year OS was 93% (95% CI, 82%-97%). The 3-year OS for high-risk ALL was 69% (95% CI, 30%-90%). All 84 (100%) patients required referral to an outside hospital for definitive ALL diagnoses and induction therapy. Forty-four (52%) patients required at least one additional referral. CONCLUSIONS: The overall outcomes demonstrated relatively high survival rates at 3 years which may be artificially elevated due to exclusion of adolescents, limited follow up, and deceased patient charts unavailable. Structural determinants of health in Gaza lead to limited diagnostic and treatment capabilities, limited access to advanced medical training, and reliance on out-of-territory transfers for care. These barriers impact the access to comprehensive pediatric care within the Gaza Strip.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Several imatinib population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models have been developed. However, their predictive performance has not been well established when extrapolated to different populations. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an external evaluation of available imatinib popPK models developed mainly in adult patients, and to evaluate the improvement in individual model-based predictions through Bayesian forecasting computed by each model at different treatment occasions. METHODS: A literature review was conducted through PubMed and Scopus to identify popPK models. Therapeutic drug monitoring data collected in adult CML patients treated with imatinib was used for external evaluation, including prediction- and simulated-based diagnostics together with Bayesian forecasting analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen imatinib popPK studies were included for model-performance evaluation. A total of 99 imatinib samples were collected from 48 adult CML patients undergoing imatinib treatment with a minimum of one plasma concentration measured at steady-state between January 2016 and December 2020. The model proposed by Petain et al showed the best performance concerning prediction-based diagnostics in the studied population. Bayesian forecasting demonstrated a significant improvement in predictive performance at the second visit. Inter-occasion variability contributed to reducing bias and improving individual model-based predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib popPK studies developed in Caucasian subjects including alpha1-acid glycoprotein showed the best model performance in terms of overall bias and precision. Moreover, two imatinib samples from different visits appear sufficient to reach an adequate model-based individual prediction performance trough Bayesian forecasting.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Here, we report the cases of two ATL patients who did not develop acute GVHD despite receiving Mog before allo-HCT. Case 1: a 63-year-old female who underwent allo-HCT from an HLA-matched donor 2 months after the last dose of Mog. Case 2: a 47-year-old male with ATL that relapsed 3 months after first allo-HCT. He received eight doses of Mog and underwent a second allo-HCT from a haploidentical donor 4 months after the last dose of Mog. Mog blood levels were measured and lymphocytes analyzed by mass cytometry. Mog blood levels measured before starting the conditioning regimens were low. A small proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was detected before and shortly after allo-HCT. When using Mog before allo-HCT, it is important to consider the number of Mog doses and the interval from the last dose of Mog to allo-HCT.

This study evaluated the effects of a WeChat-based multimodal psychoeducational intervention (ICARE programme) on fatigue, distress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL) among adult AL patients. METHODS: In total, 72 participants were randomly assigned either to an intervention or control group (n = 36), respectively, from two large tertiary hospitals in Fuzhou, China (from April to December 2019). Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and after a 4-week follow-up using the Brief Fatigue Inventory, Distress Thermometer, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-leukaemia. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants and a linear mixed model was used to analyse the score changes. RESULTS: Between the two groups, there were statistically significant improvements in fatigue, distress, anxiety, depression, physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being (all p < 0.001), and leukaemia-specific subscale (p = 0.001). The difference over time was significant for leukaemia-specific subscale and fatigue, both (p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.001), and social/family well-being (p = 0.005). The interaction effects were significant for fatigue, distress, anxiety, physical well-being, social/family well-being, and emotional well-being, all (p < 0.001), depression (p = 0.019), leukaemia-specific subscale (p = 0.008), and total QoL score (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: WeChat-based multimodal psychoeducational intervention demonstrated a significant effect in reducing fatigue, distress, anxiety, depression, and QoL in AL patients. This ICARE programme contributed to continuing care to support AL patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The ICARE programme can improve the mental health and QoL of AL patients. The application of WeChat-based psychoeducational interventions have significant potential to benefit cancer patients due to their reach and can be an added value to routine care.","['(c) 2021.

Thus, TrxR inhibitors are promising cancer therapeutic agents. We prepared different amino-substituted phenylarsine oxides and evaluated their cytotoxicity and inhibition of TrxR. Compared with our reported p-substituted molecule (8), the o-substituted molecule (10) shows improved efficacy (nearly a fourfold increase) to kill leukemia HL-60 cells. Although the compounds 8 and 10 display similar potency to inhibit the purified TrxR, the o-substitution 10 exhibits higher potency than the p-substitution 8 to inhibit the cellular TrxR activity. Molecular docking results demonstrate the favorable weak interactions of the o-amino group with the TrxR C-terminal active site. Efficient inhibition of TrxR consequently induces the oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells.

SDS is typically caused by a pathogenic mutation in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome (SBDS) gene. Patients with SDS have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. We identified germline biallelic SBDS mutations (p.K62X and p.I167M) in a 50-year-old AML patient who had never experienced the typical symptoms of SDS. The K62X mutation is one of the most common pathogenic mutations, whereas the significance of the I167M mutation was unclear. Based on cellular experiments, we concluded that the I167M mutation contributed to the development of AML, and chemotherapy including topoisomerase inhibitors, which induce DNA double-strand breaks, may have been toxic to this patient.

Herein, we identified the transcriptional landscape associated with TNBC resistance to NAC at the single-cell level by analyzing publicly available transcriptome data from more than 5,000 single cells derived from four extinction (responders) and four persistence (non-responders) patients, revealing remarkable tumor heterogeneity. Employing iterative clustering and guide-gene selection (ICGS) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), we classified TNBC single cells into several clusters based on their distinct gene signatures. The presence of clusters indicative of immune cell activation was a hallmark of the extinction group pre-NAC, while post NAC, the extinction tissue consisted mostly of breast, omental fat, and fibroblasts. The persistent gene signatures of pre-NAC resembled the gene signature of lung epithelial, mammary, and salivary glands and acute myeloid leukemia blast cells, which were associated with enhanced cellular movement and activation of FOXM1, NOTCH1, and MYC and suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFNG mechanistic networks. Multivariate survival analysis identified persistence-derived three-gene signature (KIF5B(high)HLA-C(low)IGHG2(low)) predictive of relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.2 [1.6-3.2, p < 0.0001]) in a second cohort of 360 TNBC patients.

The optimization of CAR structure using different signaling domains can alter a wide range of CAR-T cell properties, including anti-tumor activity, long-term persistence, and safety. In this study, we developed a novel CAR structure based on KIRS2/Dap12 for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) antigen CD19 and compared the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of this construct in transduced T cells with standard second-generation CAR-T cells targeting CD19 for B-ALL in vitro and in vivo and in adult relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-ALL patients. We discovered that KIRS2/Dap12 receptor infused with 4-1BB co-stimulation domain could enhance anti-tumor efficacy by remarkably increasing the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin-2 (IL-2), especially when co-cultured with antigen-positive tumor cells. In addition, CD19-KIRS2/Dap12-BB CAR-T cells showed the inspiring outcome that complete responses were seen in 4 of 4 (100%) patients without neurotoxicity and a high rate of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after CAR-T infusion in a phase I clinical trial. Given these encouraging findings, CD19-KIRS2/Dap12-BB CAR-T cells are safe and can lead to clinical responses in adult patients with r/r B-ALL, indicating that further assessment of this therapy is warranted.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Sun, Ming', 'Xu, Peipei', 'Wang, Enxiu', 'Zhou, Min', 'Xu, Tongpeng', 'Wang, Jing', 'Wang, Qian', 'Wang, Bo', 'Lu, Kaihua', 'Wang, Chen', 'Chen, Bing']","['Sun M', 'Xu P', 'Wang E', 'Zhou M', 'Xu T', 'Wang J', 'Wang Q', 'Wang B', 'Lu K', 'Wang C', 'Chen B']","['Department of Oncology Center, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Gusu School, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Nanjing CART Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing 210032, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008, PR China.', 'Clinical College of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nnajing 210008, PR China.', 'Nanjing CART Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing 210032, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Baise 533000, PR China.', 'Clinical Pathological Diagnosis & Research Center, Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Baise 533000, PR China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Molecular Pathology (Hepatobiliary Diseases) of Guangxi, Baise 533000, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Runtian Pharmaceutical Chain Pharmacy Co., Ltd., Nanjing 210000, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen 518107, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'Nanjing CART Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing 210032, PR China.', 'Department of Research and Development, Nanjing Aide Institute of Immunotherapy, Nanjing 211808, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210828,United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,['NOTNLM'],"['4-1BB', 'CAR-T cells', 'KIRS2/DAP12 signaling domain', 'clinical trial', 'r/r B-ALL']",2021/10/28 06:00,2021/10/28 06:01,['2021/10/27 07:11'],"['2021/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/27 07:11 [entrez]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2021.08.014 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(21)00125-X [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2021 Aug 28;23:96-106. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2021.08.014. eCollection 2021 Dec 17.,23,,96-106,,,PMC8517091,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has likely led to the CpG suppression observed in many RNA viruses, including retroviruses. Sequences added to retroviral vector genomes, such as internal promoters, transgenes, or regulatory elements, substantially increase CpG abundance. Because these CpGs could allow retroviral vector RNA to be targeted by ZAP, we analyzed whether it restricts vector production, transduction efficiency, and transgene expression. Surprisingly, even though CpG-high HIV-1 was efficiently inhibited by ZAP in HEK293T cells, depleting ZAP did not substantially increase lentiviral vector titer using several packaging and genome plasmids. ZAP overexpression also did not inhibit lentiviral vector titer. In addition, decreasing CpG abundance in a lentiviral vector genome did not increase its titer, and a gammaretroviral vector derived from murine leukemia virus was not substantially restricted by ZAP. Overall, we show that the increased CpG abundance in retroviral vectors relative to the wild-type retroviruses they are derived from does not intrinsically sensitize them to ZAP. Further understanding of how ZAP specifically targets transcripts to inhibit their expression may allow the development of CpG sequence contexts that efficiently recruit or evade this antiviral system.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Sertkaya, Helin', 'Hidalgo, Laura', 'Ficarelli, Mattia', 'Kmiec, Dorota', 'Signell, Adrian W', 'Ali, Sadfer', 'Parker, Hannah', 'Wilson, Harry', 'Neil, Stuart J D', 'Malim, Michael H', 'Vink, Conrad A', 'Swanson, Chad M']","['Sertkaya H', 'Hidalgo L', 'Ficarelli M', 'Kmiec D', 'Signell AW', 'Ali S', 'Parker H', 'Wilson H', 'Neil SJD', 'Malim MH', 'Vink CA', 'Swanson CM']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", 'Cell & Gene Therapy Platform, Medicinal Science and Technology, GSK, Stevenage SG1 2NY, UK.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", 'Cell & Gene Therapy Platform, Medicinal Science and Technology, GSK, Stevenage SG1 2NY, UK.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210828,United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

A multitude of cytokines secreted from MSCs are known to give such multifunctional attributes, but details of their role are yet to be unknown. In the present study, MSCs were cultured, characterized and co-cultured with Molt-4 cells as acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line in a trans-well plate. Then, cultured Molt-4 alone and Molt-4 co-cultured with MSCs (10:1) were collected on day 7 and subjected to real time-PCR and Western blotting for gene and protein expression assessment, respectively. Ki-67/caspase-3 as well as telomere length were investigated by flow cytometry and real time-PCR, respectively. The results showed that MSCs caused significant decrease in telomere length as well as hTERT gene expression of Molt-4 cells. Also, gene and protein expression of BAD and P53 were significantly increased. Furthermore, the flow cytometry analysis indicated the decrease and increase of the Ki-67 and caspaspase-3 expression, respectively.

The advances have been particularly marked with B-lineage ALL. The development of bispecific antibodies directed against CD19 ushered in a new era in overcoming persistent minimal disease in newly diagnosed ALL patients as well as successfully treating those with relapsed disease. The immune-conjugates targeting CD22 have also had a similarly impressive role in improving the outcome in such patients. These advances are now being extended to frontline regimens for B-lineage ALL, including the Philadelphia-chromosome-positive subtype. Over the past decade, the development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has ushered in a new era, opening up hope when none was available for patients with particularly advanced disease. Such advances come at a considerable price for toxicity, which, however, are lessening with experience and the development of new agents to ameliorate some of the toxicities. Unfortunately, the progress for T-cell in ALL has lagged behind that of B-lineage ALL. Of late, however, there are preliminary results of potentially exciting data using monoclonal antibodies against CD38, in the form of daratumumab, and it is hoped that these will lead to an equally successful advance in the treatment of T-ALL.

Given that these improvements have been reported in clinical trial and referral center populations, questions remain about the generalizability of this observation to patients treated in the community. Contrasting the overall survival experience of 3783 patients seen at Mayo Clinic and 57,654 patients followed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) between 2004 and 2018, we observed different mortality trends across patient populations and subgroups. Early mortality decreased and estimated 5-year overall survival increased over time in both patient populations. Excess mortality (compared to the general population) declined over time in Mayo Clinic patients and remained largely unchanged in SEER patients. Improvements over time were primarily observed in patients with favorable disease characteristics and older patients with multiple myeloma remain a vulnerable population with significant excess mortality compared to the United States general population.

It has been suggested that the composition of pre-treatment microbiota underpins personalized responses to antibiotics. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested in humans. In this high-throughput amplicon study, we analyzed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of 260 stool samples collected twice weekly from 39 patients with acute leukemia during their ~ 4 weeks of hospitalization for chemotherapy while they received multiple antibiotics. RESULTS: Despite heavy and sustained antibiotic pressure, microbial communities in samples from the same patient remained more similar to one another than to those from other patients. Principal component mixed effect regression using microbiota and granular antibiotic exposure data showed that microbiota departures from baseline depend on the composition of the pre-treatment microbiota. Penalized generalized estimating equations identified 6 taxa within pre-treatment microbiota that predicted the extent of antibiotic-induced perturbations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that specific species in pre-treatment microbiota determine personalized microbiota responses to antibiotics in humans. Thus, precision interventions targeting pre-treatment microbiota may prevent antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and its adverse clinical consequences. Video abstract.",['(c) 2021.

However, only a few circRNAs have been functionally characterized in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Here, we investigated the expression pattern of circRNAs in pediatric AML using a circRNA microarray. The characteristics, potential diagnostic value, and prognostic significance of circRNF220 were evaluated. A series of functional experiments were performed to investigate the role of circRNF220 in primary pediatric AML cells. Then we investigated the aberrant transcriptional networks regulated by circRNF220 in primary AML cells by RNA-seq. Furthermore, biotin RNA pulldown assays were implemented to verify the relationship between circRNF220 and miR-30a. RESULTS: We identified a circRNA, circRNF220, which was specifically abundant in and accumulated in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of pediatric patients with AML. It could distinguish AML from ALL and other hematological malignancies with high sensitivity and specificity. Significantly, circRNF220 expression independently predicted prognosis, while high expression of circRNF220 was an unfavorable prognostic marker for relapse. Furthermore, we characterized the function of circRNF220 and found that circRNF220 knockdown specifically inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary cells. Mechanistically, circRNF220 may act as an endogenous sponge of miR-30a to sequester miR-30a and inhibit its activity, which increases the expression of its targets MYSM1 and IER2 and implicated in AML relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings demonstrated that circRNF220 could be highly efficient and specific for the accurate diagnosis of pediatric AML, with implications for relapse prediction.",['(c) 2021.

The secretory ribonucleases (RNases) found in vertebrates have cytotoxic ribonucleolytic activity that is kept in check by a cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein, RI. METHODS: We engineered amino acid substitutions that enable human RNase 1 to evade RI upon its cyclization into a zymogen that is activated by the HIV-1 protease. In effect, the zymogen has an HIV-1 protease cleavage site between the termini of the wild-type enzyme, thereby positioning a cleavable linker over the active site that blocks access to a substrate. RESULTS: The amino acid substitutions in RNase 1 diminish its affinity for RI by 10(6)-fold and confer high toxicity for T-cell leukemia cells. Pretreating these cells with the zymogen leads to a substantial drop in their viability upon HIV-1 infection, indicating specific toxicity toward infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the utility of ribonuclease zymogens as biologic prodrugs.",['(c) 2021.

The ABCB1 gene is part of a family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes involved in the progression of various types of cancer. The following work aimed to evaluate the expression levels of the ABCB1 gene and the C3435T SNP with the response to first-line treatment and survival in patients with AML. METHODS: In total 135 samples were taken to isolate total RNA and DNA at the beginning of the treatment. Expression analysis by RT-qPCR and SNP C3435T assessment method were performed for real-time Polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: The expression levels impact on the survival of patients with AML compared to low or absent levels; the CC genotype was found in 22.9%, the CT genotype was found in 47.4%, and the TT genotype was found in 29.6%, the presence of the C3435T SNP, the TT genotype also impacts with a lower survival compared to CT and CC genotypes.

It inhibits the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. Due to resistance of cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI-571, the combined effect of STI-571 and TGF-beta1 on K562 cells was studied in the present research. Results revealed that the TGF-beta1 cell signaling pathway, which is activated in K562 cells treated with TGF-beta1, activates collective cell signaling pathways involved in survival and apoptosis. It is noteworthy that treating K562 cells with STI-571 triggered apoptotic pathways, accompanied by a reduction in proteins such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, p-AKT, p-Stat5, p-FOXO3, and Mcl-1 and an increase in the pro-apoptotic proteins PARP cleavage, and p27, leading to an increase in sub-G1 phase-arrested and Annexin-positive cells. Interestingly, the proliferation behavior of TGF-beta1-induced cells was changed with the combination therapy, and STI-571-induced apoptosis was also prompted by this combination. Thus, combination treatment appears to promote sub-G1 cell cycle arrest compared to individually treated cells. Furthermore, it strongly triggered apoptotic signaling. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 did not negatively impact the effect of STI-571, based on positive annexin cells, and AKT protein phosphorylation remains effective in apoptosis.","['(c) 2021 Masoome Bakhshayesh et al., published by De Gruyter.']","['Bakhshayesh, Masoome', 'Gohari, Ladan Hosseini', 'Barati, Mahmood', 'Safa, Majid']","['Bakhshayesh M', 'Gohari LH', 'Barati M', 'Safa M']","['Genetics department, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Medical Laboratory Science Department, School of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211026,Germany,Biomol Concepts,Biomolecular concepts,101518829,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BCR-ABL Positive', 'Chronic', 'Drug resistance', 'Leukemia', 'Myelogenous', 'transforming growth factor beta1']",2021/10/27 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/10/26 20:34'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/26 20:34 [entrez]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['bmc-2021-0016 [pii]', '10.1515/bmc-2021-0016 [doi]']",epublish,Biomol Concepts. 2021 Oct 26;12(1):144-155. doi: 10.1515/bmc-2021-0016.,12,1,144-155,20220113,"['Apoptosis', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",,,,,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After decades of slow progress, recent years saw a surge of novel agents for its treatment. The most recent advancement is the registration of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ventoclax in combination with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) in the US and Europe for AML patients not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients with this combination results in remission rates that so far could only be achieved with intensive treatment. However, not all AML patients respond equally well, and some patients relapse early, while other patients experience longer periods of complete remission. A hallmark of AML is its remarkable genetic, molecular and clinical heterogeneity. Here, we review the current knowledge about molecular features of AML that help estimate the probability of response to venetoclax-containing therapies. In contrast to other newly developed AML therapies that target specific recurrent molecular alterations, it seems so far that responses are not specific for a certain subgroup. One exception is spliceosome mutations, where good response has been observed in clinical trials with venetoclax/azacitidine. These mutations are rather associated with a more unfavorable outcome with chemotherapy. In summary, venetoclax in combination with hypomethylating agents represents a significant novel option for AML patients with various molecular aberrations. Mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance seem to overlap with those towards chemotherapy.","['(c) 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']","['Makowka, Philipp', 'Stolp, Verena', 'Stoschek, Karoline', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Makowka P', 'Stolp V', 'Stoschek K', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine 2, Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Frankfurt and DKFZ, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Frankfurt and DKFZ, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Frankfurt and DKFZ, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211027,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*azacitidine', '*genotype', '*hypomethylating agents', '*resistance', '*targeted therapy']",2021/10/27 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/10/26 20:34'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/26 20:34 [entrez]']","['hsz-2021-0288 [pii]', '10.1515/hsz-2021-0288 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Chem. 2021 Oct 27;402(12):1547-1564. doi: 10.1515/hsz-2021-0288.

This study aims to investigate the mechanism by which miR-221-3p regulates HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, so as to provide a new idea for targeted therapy towards HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression quantification data including mature miRNA and mRNA were accessed from TCGA-LIHC dataset, and matched clinical information was obtained as well, which helped identify the miRNA of interest. Thereafter, effect of the miRNA on HCC cell biological functions was assessed with a series of in vitro experiments, such as qRT-PCR, MTT, wound healing assay and Transwell. To gain more insight into the mechanism of the miRNA in HCC, bioinformatics method was conducted to predict downstream target gene. The potential targeting relationship between the miRNA and the predicted mRNA was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Western blot was performed to test protein expression. RESULTS: MiR-221-3p identified by differential expression analysis was found to be significantly elevated in HCC tissue. Overexpressing miR-221-3p noticeably enhanced HCC cell proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities. Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), confirmed as a downstream target of miR-221-3p in HCC by dual-luciferase reporter assay, was poorly expressed in HCC tissue and cells. Additionally, the expression of LIFR was decreased following the targeted binding between miR-221-3p and LIFR 3'-UTR, while increasing the expression of LIFR attenuated the promoting effect of miR-221-3p on HCC cells. CONCLUSION: MiR-221-3p is an oncogene in HCC cells, and it exerts its role in HCC cell viability and motility via targeting LIFR.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur, A.C.

With the introduction of high-throughput sequencing technologies, a rapid, in-depth portrayal of the genomic landscape in major lymphoma entities was achieved. Whilst a few lymphoma entities were characterized by a predominant gene mutation (e.g. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and hairy cell leukemia), the vast majority demonstrated a very diverse genetic landscape with a high number of recurrent gene mutations (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma), indeed reflecting the great clinical heterogeneity among lymphomas. These studies have allowed better understanding of the ontogeny and evolution of different lymphomas, while also identifying new genetic markers that can complement lymphoma diagnostics and improve prognostication. However, despite these efforts, there is still a limited number of gene mutations with predictive impact that can guide treatment selection. In this review, we will highlight clinically relevant diagnostic, prognostic and predictive markers in lymphomas that are used today in routine diagnostics. We will also discuss how comprehensive genomic characterization using broad sequencing panels, allowing for the simultaneous detection of different types of genetic aberrations, may aid future development of precision diagnostics in lymphomas. This may in turn pave the way for the implementation of tailored precision therapy strategies at the individual patient level.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), double homeobox 4 fused with immunoglobulin heavy chain (DUX4/IGH) can lead to the aberrant production of E-26 transformation-specific family related gene abnormal transcript (ERGalt ) and other splicing variants. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning this process remains elusive. Here, we aimed to know how DUX4/IGH triggers abnormal splicing in leukemia. METHODS: The differential intron retention analysis was conducted to identify novel DUX4/IGH-driven splicing in B-ALL patients. X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and analytical ultracentrifugation were used to investigate how DUX4/IGH recognize double DUX4 responsive element (DRE)-DRE sites. The ERGalt biogenesis and B-cell differentiation assays were performed to characterize the DUX4/IGH crosslinking activity. To check whether recombination-activating gene 1/2 (RAG1/2) was required for DUX4/IGH-driven splicing, the proximity ligation assay, co-immunoprecipitation, mammalian two hybrid characterizations, in vitro RAG1/2 cleavage, and shRNA knock-down assays were performed. RESULTS: We reported previously unrecognized intron retention events in C-type lectin domain family 12, member A abnormal transcript (CLEC12Aalt ) and chromosome 6 open reading frame 89 abnormal transcript (C6orf89alt ), where also harbored repetitive DRE-DRE sites. Supportively, X-ray crystallography and SAXS characterization revealed that DUX4 homeobox domain (HD)1-HD2 might dimerize into a dumbbell-shape trans configuration to crosslink two adjacent DRE sites. Impaired DUX4/IGH-mediated crosslinking abolishes ERGalt , CLEC12Aalt , and C6orf89alt biogenesis, resulting in marked alleviation of its inhibitory effect on B-cell differentiation. Furthermore, we also observed a rare RAG1/2-mediated recombination signal sequence-like DNA edition in DUX4/IGH target genes. Supportively, shRNA knock-down of RAG1/2 in leukemic Reh cells consistently impaired the biogenesis of ERGalt , CLEC12Aalt , and C6orf89alt . CONCLUSIONS: All these results suggest that DUX4/IGH-driven DNA crosslinking is required for RAG1/2 recruitment onto the double tandem DRE-DRE sites, catalyzing V(D)J-like recombination and oncogenic splicing in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We investigated the immunogenicity of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in these patients. Individuals with MBL/untreated CLL and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi)-treated CLL patients were given two doses of RZV separated by 2 months. Responses assessed at 3 and 12 months from the first dose of RZV by an anti-glycoprotein E ELISA antibody assay and by dual-color Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-2FLUOROSPOT assays were compared to historic controls matched by age and sex. About 62 patients (37 MBL/untreated CLL and 25 BTKi-treated CLL) were enrolled with a median age of 68 years at vaccination. An antibody response at 3 months was seen in 45% of participants, which was significantly lower compared to historic controls (63%, p = .03). The antibody response did not significantly differ between MBL/untreated CLL and BTKi-treated CLL (51% vs. 36%, respectively, p = .23). The CD4+ T-cell response to vaccination was significantly lower in study participants compared to controls (54% vs. 96%, p < .001), mainly due to lower responses among BTKi-treated patients compared to untreated MBL/CLL (32% vs. 73%, p = .008). Overall, only 29% of participants achieved combined antibody and cellular responses to RZV. Among participants with response assessment at 12 months (n = 47), 24% had antibody titers below the response threshold.

ASXL1 mutations associate with poor prognosis in CMML and significantly co-occur with NRAS mutations. Here, we show that concurrent ASXL1 and NRAS mutations defined a population of CMML patients with shorter leukemia-free survival than those with ASXL1 mutation only. Corroborating this human data, Asxl1-/- accelerated CMML progression and promoted CMML transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in NrasG12D/+ mice. NrasG12D/+; Asxl1-/- (NA) leukemia cells displayed hyperactivation of MEK/ERK signaling, increased global level of H3K27ac, and Flt3 upregulation. Moreover, we find that NA-AML cells overexpressed all the major inhibitory immune checkpoint ligands, PD-L1/L2, CD155, and CD80/86. Among them, overexpression of PD-L1 and CD86 correlated with upregulation of AP-1 transcription factors (TFs) in NA-AML cells. An AP-1 inhibitor or shRNAs against AP-1 TF Jun decreased PD-L1 and CD86 expression in NA-AML cells. Once NA-AML cells were transplanted into syngeneic recipients, NA-derived T cells were not detectable. Host-derived wildtype T cells overexpressed PD-1 and TIGIT receptors, leading to a predominant exhausted T cell phenotype. Combined inhibition of MEK and BET led to downregulation of Flt3 and AP-1 expression, partial restoration of the immune microenvironment, enhancement of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, and prolonged survival in NA-AML mice. Our study suggests that combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy may be beneficial for treating secondary AML with concurrent ASXL1 and NRAS mutations.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['You, Xiaona', 'Liu, Fabao', 'Binder, Moritz', 'Vedder, Alexis', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Wen, Zhi', 'Gao, Xin', 'Flietner, Evan', 'Rajagopalan, Adhithi', 'Zhou, Yun', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Mangaonkar, Abhishek A', 'Liao, Ruiqi', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Droin, Nathalie M', 'Hunter, Anthony M', 'Nikolaev, Sergey', 'Balasis, Maria E', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Will, Britta', 'Nadiminti, Kalyan Vara Ganesh', 'Yang, David T', 'Geissler, Klaus', 'Solary, Eric', 'Xu, Wei', 'Padron, Eric', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Zhang, Jing']","['You X', 'Liu F', 'Binder M', 'Vedder A', 'Lasho TL', 'Wen Z', 'Gao X', 'Flietner E', 'Rajagopalan A', 'Zhou Y', 'Finke CM', 'Mangaonkar AA', 'Liao R', 'Kong G', 'Ranheim EA', 'Droin NM', 'Hunter AM', 'Nikolaev S', 'Balasis ME', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Levine RL', 'Will B', 'Nadiminti KVG', 'Yang DT', 'Geissler K', 'Solary E', 'Xu W', 'Padron E', 'Patnaik MM', 'Zhang J']","['UW-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States.', 'UW-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.', 'H.

Primary objectives included safety and determining recommended dose; antitumor activity by 2018 International Workshop on CLL guidelines was exploratory. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed in blood and marrow. Twenty-three of 25 enrolled patients received liso-cel and were evaluable for safety. Patients had a median of 4 (range, 211) prior therapies (100% had ibrutinib; 65% had venetoclax) and 83% had high-risk features including mutated TP53 and del(17p).

Early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential for effective cancer control and have been widely analyzed in childhood cancer. However, few studies have described the time to diagnosis and treatment in children with ALL. This study investigated delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation and their impact on survival. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 419 patients aged 0 to 14 years at a tertiary hospital between 2011 and 2015. The optimal cutoff values for delays were determined by X-tile software. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used to evaluate the impact of delays on survival. RESULTS: The median diagnosis, treatment, and total delays were 21 (interquartile range [IQR]: 11-35), 4 (IQR: 2-7), and 26 (IQR: 16-43) days, respectively. The results of multivariate analyses showed that diagnosis delay, risk stratification, and minimal residual disease level were independent predictors for treatment outcome in childhood ALL. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that a longer time to diagnosis negatively affected the clinical outcome of childhood ALL. Reducing the time to diagnosis could help to improve survival in these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Stable overexpression of LINC00998 inhibited AML cell viability, colony ability, DNA synthesis rate and increased apoptosis. LINC00998 was mainly located in the cytoplasm, in which interacted with ZFP36 ring finger protein (ZFP36), a mRNA destabilizing factor, resulting in increased decay of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), a well-known proto-oncogene in AML. Overexpression of mTORC2 partly blocked the tumor suppressive effects of LINC00998. Importantly, LINC00998 shortened in vivo AML cell survival in xenograft tumor model.

Plasma concentration-time data were collected from 260 participants (86 healthy volunteers; 174 patients with hematologic malignancies) enrolled across 7 clinical trials. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Ponatinib pharmacokinetics were described by a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment. The final model included body weight and age as covariates on the apparent central volume of distribution; however, exposure variability explained by these covariates was small compared with overall variability in the population. None of the covariates evaluated, including sex, age (19-85 years), race, body weight (40.7-152.0 kg), total bilirubin (0.1-3.16 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (6-188 U/L), albumin (23.0-52.5 g/L), and creatinine clearance (>/=28 mL/min) had clinically meaningful effects on apparent oral clearance.

Here, we aimed to evaluate BCL6 expression and the effects of BCL6 inhibitor (FX1) on HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. BCL6 expression was higher in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines than that in uninfected T cell lines. BCL6 was localized mostly in the nucleus. The virus oncoprotein Tax induced BCL6 mRNA expression in T cells, whereas BCL6 knockdown reduced HTLV-1-infected T cell proliferation; thus, confirmed the association of BCL6 with cancer progression. Further, FX1 efficiently inhibited the cell growth and survival of HTLV-1-infected T cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The decreased levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins (phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin D2 and c-Myc) and the increased levels of BCL6 target proteins (p21, p27 and p53) showed that FX1 arrested cell cycle at the G1 phase. Apoptosis was induced concomitantly with Bak upregulation and downregulation of survivin, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, as well as with the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. FX1 also inhibited NF-kappaB and Akt signaling pathways. These events were because of the induction of the activity of cell cycle checkpoint proteins and relief of direct repression of the targets of cell cycle checkpoint proteins. Thus, BCL6 might be considered a novel target for ATL treatment.","['(c) 2021.

A vast variety of environmental and lifestyle factors play a role in AML incidence. This study aimed to assess the factors related to AML. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. METHODS: This case-control study was performed on 137 AML cases during 2018-2021 at Beheshti Hospital in Hamadan, Iran, and 137 gender/age-matched controls. A questionnaire including 12 items was used to obtain information about lifestyle and environmental factors. A univariate and multiple variate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR), and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to investigate the relationship between the studied variables and the incidence of AML. RESULTS: Based on findings, 62 (45.3%) out of the 137 leukemic cases were male and 75 (4.7%) were females. A statistically significant increased risk for AML was found with regard to prior usage of cytotoxic agents (OR: 8.00, 95% CI 1.01, 63.9, P=0.050), family history of malignancies (OR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.65, 7.92, P=0.001), exposure to electrical power (OR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.52, 6.81, P=0.002), and history of mental diseases (OR: 8.50, 95% CI: 3.64, 19.80, P=0.001). It was found that the AML incidence had no association with age, gender, radiation therapy, cigarette smoking, prior chemotherapy, congenital disorders, exposure to chemical agents, history of infectious mononucleosis, exercise, and blood transfusion (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The current results suggested that cytotoxic agents, family history of malignancy, mental disorders, and exposure to electrical power could play a role in AML incidence.",,"['Maleki Behzad, Masumeh', 'Abbasi, Mohammad', 'Oliaei, Iman', 'Ghorbani Gholiabad, Somayeh', 'Rafieemehr, Hassan']","['Maleki Behzad M', 'Abbasi M', 'Oliaei I', 'Ghorbani Gholiabad S', 'Rafieemehr H']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.', 'Students Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Paramedicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. rafee_1352@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210812,Iran,J Res Health Sci,Journal of research in health sciences,101480094,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2021/10/27 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/10/26 12:21'],"['2021/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/26 12:21 [entrez]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['6842 [pii]', '10.34172/jrhs.2021.58 [doi]']",epublish,J Res Health Sci. 2021 Aug 12;21(3):e00525. doi: 10.34172/jrhs.2021.58.,21,3,e00525,20211028,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from 10 healthy individuals and 5 untreated patients with B-cell malignancies were sensitized with rituximab. Patients' diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and follicular lymphoma. MNCs were isolated by gradient density centrifugation. An EDTA/glycine acid (EGA) elution method was used to dissociate CD20-rituximab complexes; afterwards, CD20-positive immunoreactivity was assessed by flow cytometry. A saturation curve was built based on serial dilutions of rituximab. Median fluorescent intensities of CD20-positive signals were obtained before sensitization with rituximab and after its elution with EGA. RESULTS: CD20-positive signals were not detectable by flow cytometry after rituximab sensitization of B cells. CD20-sensitized vs CD20-unsensitized, CD20-sensitized vs CD20-eluted, and CD20-eluted vs CD20-negative control (NC) MNC populations exhibited statistical differences (P = .001), while CD20-sensitized vs CD20-NC populations did not (P = .499), confirming CD20 antigen masking by rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab interfered with the flow cytometry protocol for CD20 determination on normal and neoplastic B cells. The EGA method efficiently eluted rituximab, allowing for accurate identification of CD20-positive B cells.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021. All rights reserved.

METHODS: To investigate their immunophenotype and genomic features, we identified 5 cases of AML with t(8;16) through a retrospective review of the databases at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL, and Washington University Medical Center, in St Louis, MO. RESULTS: In all, 4 of 5 cases were therapy related and 1 was possibly therapy related. The leukemic blasts showed distinctive features, including bright CD45 expression and remarkably high side scatter that overlapped with maturing myeloid elements, making the blasts difficult to identify on initial examination. They were positive for CD13, CD33, and CD64 and negative for CD34 and CD117. Next-generation sequencing profiling of 4 cases revealed pathogenic ASXL1 (2 cases), FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations (2 cases), and other pathogenic mutations. In 3 patients, t(8;16) was the sole cytogenetic abnormality; additional aberrations were found in 2 patients. Single nucleotide polymorphism microarray revealed 1 case with 7q deletion as a secondary clone. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the distinctive immunophenotypic profile of AML with t(8;16), which, along with its unique morphology, often presents a diagnostic challenge. We showed that mutations of either ASXL1 or FLT3-TKD are seen in most cases of this leukemia.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021. All rights reserved.

We investigated how constitutive extracellular mediator release by primary human AML cells alters proteomic profiles of normal bone marrow MSCs. An average of 6814 proteins (range 6493-6918 proteins) were quantified for 41 MSC cultures supplemented with AML-cell conditioned medium, whereas an average of 6715 proteins (range 6703-6722) were quantified for untreated control MSCs. The AML effect on global MSC proteomic profiles varied between patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified 10 patients (5/10 secondary AML) showing more extensive AML-effects on the MSC proteome, whereas the other 31 patients clustered together with the untreated control MSCs and showed less extensive AML-induced effects. These two patient subsets differed especially with regard to MSC levels of extracellular matrix and mitochondrial/metabolic regulatory proteins. Less than 10% of MSC proteins were significantly altered by the exposure to AML-conditioned media; 301 proteins could only be quantified after exposure to conditioned medium and 201 additional proteins were significantly altered compared with the levels in control samples (153 increased, 48 decreased).

Here, building from our clinical discovery that cancerous cells from patients with different leukaemia forms featured stable and strong expression of CD71, we designed a ferritin-based As nanomedicine, As@Fn, that bound to leukaemia cells with very high affinity, and efficiently delivered cytotoxic As(III) into a large diversity of leukaemia cell lines and patient cells. Moreover, As@Fn exerted strong anti-leukaemia effects in diverse cell-line-derived xenograft models, as well as in a patient-derived xenograft model, in which it consistently outperformed the gold standard, showing its potential as a precision treatment for a variety of leukaemias.","['(c) 2021.

Since the first PAK was discovered in 1994, studies have revealed their fundamental and biological importance in the development of physiological systems. Within the cell, PAKs also play significant roles in regulating essential cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, gene expression, cell survival, and cell cycle progression. These processes are often deregulated in numerous cancers when different PAKs are overexpressed or amplified at the chromosomal level. Furthermore, PAKs modulate multiple oncogenic signaling pathways which facilitate apoptosis escape, uncontrolled proliferation, and drug resistance. There is growing insight into the critical roles of PAKs in regulating steady-state hematopoiesis, including the properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and the initiation and progression of hematological malignancies. This review will focus on the most recent studies that provide experimental evidence showing how specific PAKs regulate the properties of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and drug-resistant cells to initiate and maintain hematological malignancies. The current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the PAKs operate in specific human leukemia or lymphomas will be discussed. From a translational point of view, PAKs have been suggested to be critical therapeutic targets and potential prognosis markers; thus, this review will also discuss current therapeutic strategies against hematological malignancies using existing small-molecule PAK inhibitors, as well as promising combination treatments, to sensitize drug-resistant cells to conventional therapies. The challenges of toxicity and non-specific targeting associated with some PAK inhibitors, as well as how future approaches for PAK inhibition to overcome these limitations, will also be addressed.","['(c) 2021.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing allo-HCT for Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) conditioned either with TBI (n=55) or chemotherapy (n=84) were compared. The following transplant outcomes were analyzed: overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), relapse incidence (RI), and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)-free-relapse-free survival (GRFS). RESULTS: All analyzed long-term transplant outcomes were significantly better for patients conditioned with TBI at 2 years after transplant. OS at 2 years was 84% after TBI and 60.5% after chemotherapy-conditioning (p=0.005). Risk factor analysis showed that two factors, TBI-based conditioning and transplant in first remission of ALL, significantly improved OS, EFS, GRFS, and decreased RI. CONCLUSION: TBI-based conditioning before allogeneic HCT in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia provides significantly better transplant outcomes, when compared to chemotherapy-based conditioning.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Styczynski, Jan', 'Debski, Robert', 'Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Gagola, Katarzyna', 'Marquardt, Ewa', 'Roszkowski, Krzysztof', 'Winiecki, Janusz', 'Irga-Jaworska, Ninela', 'Hennig, Marcin', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Plonowski, Marcin', 'Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Lecka, Monika', 'Konieczek, Joanna', 'Galazka, Przemyslaw', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Richert-Przygonska, Monika', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Styczynski J', 'Debski R', 'Czyzewski K', 'Gagola K', 'Marquardt E', 'Roszkowski K', 'Winiecki J', 'Irga-Jaworska N', 'Hennig M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Plonowski M', 'Ociepa T', 'Lecka M', 'Konieczek J', 'Galazka P', 'Pogorzala M', 'Richert-Przygonska M', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland; jstyczynski@cm.umk.pl.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Regional Blood Transfusion Center (RCKiK), Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Regional Blood Transfusion Center (RCKiK), Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Oncology Center, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Oncology Center, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hemato-Oncology and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'GRFS', 'GVHD-free-relapse-free survival', 'children', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'total body irradiation']",2021/10/27 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/10/26 05:46'],"['2021/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/26 05:46 [entrez]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['35/6/3315 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.12627 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2021 Nov-Dec;35(6):3315-3320. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12627.,35,6,3315-3320,20211027,"['Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC8627707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are no reports showing the effects of DMC on the immune response in leukemia mice in vivo. Herein, we evaluated the impact of DMC on immune responses in WEHI-3-generated leukemia mice in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty male BALB/c mice were separated randomly into five groups. Group I is normal mice, and groups II-V mice of generated leukemia by WEHI-3 cells. Group II-V mice were intraperitoneally injected with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, as the positive control), 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg of DMC, respectively, every two days for 14 days. The body weight, blood, peritoneal fluid, liver, and spleen were individually analyzed. RESULTS: DMC did not significantly affect animal appearance and body weight. It decreased liver and spleen weight at a high dose. DMC did not affect the cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) and CD19 cell populations but induced decrease of CD11b at 30 mg/kg treatment. However, DMC at low dose significantly increased the cluster of macrophage (Mac-3) cell populations, but at high dose it decreased them.

It is unknown how risk-stratified therapy impacts the health status of ALL survivors. METHODS: We estimated and compared the prevalence of self-reported poor health status among adult (>/=18 years) survivors of childhood ALL diagnosed at age <21 years from 1970 to 1999 and sibling controls, excluding proxy reports. Therapy combinations defined treatment groups representative of 1970s therapy (70s), standard- and high-risk 1980s and 1990s therapy (80sSR, 80sHR, 90sSR, 90sHR), and relapse/bone marrow transplant (R/BMT). Log-binomial models, adjusted for clinical and demographic factors, compared outcomes between groups using prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Among 5,119 survivors and 4,693 siblings, survivors were more likely to report poor health status in each domain including poor general health (13.5% vs. 7.4%; PR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.69-2.19). Compared with 70s, 90sSR and 90sHR were less likely to report poor general health (90sSR: PR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.98; 90sHR: PR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.87), functional impairment (90sSR: PR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42-0.76; 90sHR: PR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95), and activity limitations (90sSR: 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.83; 90sHR: PR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.91). An added adjustment for chronic conditions in multivariable models partially attenuated 90sSR risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Risk-stratified ALL therapy has succeeded in reducing risk for poor general health, functional impairment, and activity limitations among more recent survivors of standard- and high-risk therapy. IMPACT: Future research into the relationship between risk-stratified therapy, health status, and late health outcomes may provide new opportunities to further improve late morbidity among survivors.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Dixon, Stephanie B', 'Chen, Yan', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Howell, Rebecca M', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Nathan, Paul C']","['Dixon SB', 'Chen Y', 'Yasui Y', 'Pui CH', 'Hunger SP', 'Silverman LB', 'Ness KK', 'Green DM', 'Howell RM', 'Leisenring WM', 'Kadan-Lottick NS', 'Krull KR', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Neglia JP', 'Hudson MM', 'Robison LL', 'Mertens AC', 'Armstrong GT', 'Nathan PC']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee. stephanie.dixon@stjude.org."", 'School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Division of Oncology and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Radiation Physics Department, The University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Cancer Prevention and Clinical Statistics Programs, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211025,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,,,2021/10/27 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/10/26 05:44'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/26 05:44 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-21-0667 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0667 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2022 Jan;31(1):150-160. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0667.

The objective of this retrospective study was to characterize antibody responses induced by a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 160 kidney transplant recipients and 20 patients treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Prevalence of anti-spike IgG >/= 7.1 and >/= 30 BAU/mL after the third dose were 47% (75/160) and 39% (63/160) in kidney transplant recipients, and 57% (29/51) and 50% (10/20) in patients treated for CLL. Longitudinal follow-up identified a moderate increase in SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG levels after a third dose of vaccine in kidney transplant recipients (0.19 vs. 5.28 BAU/mL, p = 0.03) and in patients treated for CLL (0.63 vs. 10.7 BAU/mL, p = 0.0002). This increase in IgG levels had a limited impact on prevalence of anti-spike IgG >/= 30 BAU/mL in kidney transplant recipients (17%, 2/12 vs. 33%, 4/12, p = 0.64) and in patients treated for CLL (5%, 1/20 vs. 45%, 9/20, p = 0.008).

This study aimed to explore the function of circular RNA circPRKCI/miR-20a-5p/SOX4 axis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our data showed that the expression of circPRKCI and SOX4 was enhanced while the expression of miR-20a-5p was reduced in the clinical T-ALL samples. The expression of miR-20a-5p was negatively associated with circPRKCI and SOX4 in the T-ALL patients and the expression of circPRKCI was positive correlated with SOX4 in the T-ALL patients. Functionally, the silencing of circPRKCI suppressed the viability of T-ALL cells. Conversely, the knockdown of circPRKCI promoted the apoptosis of T-ALL cells. The levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase3 were induced by the depletion of circPRKCI in T-ALL cells. Mechanically, the luciferase activity of circPRKCI was significantly decreased in T-ALL cells after the treatment of miR-20a-5p mimic. Meanwhile, the silencing of circPRKCI promoted the expression of miR-20a-5p in T-ALL cells, implying that circPRKCI serves as a competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) of miR-20a-5p. We validated that the treatment of miR-20a-5p mimic inhibited the viability of T-ALL cells. MiR-20a-5p mimic enhanced the apoptosis of T-ALL cells. The expression of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase3 was increased by miR-20a-5p mimic in the cells. In summarization, we concluded that circular RNA circPRKCI contributed to malignant progression of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by modulating miR-20a-5p/SOX4 axis.

Methylated cytosine (5-methylcytosine) can be oxidized by the TET family of enzymes to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), a key intermediate in the demethylation cycle, and 5-hmC levels are reduced in malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma. We constructed a tissue microarray of human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma tumors and found a global reduction in 5-hmC levels compared with that in the adjacent skin. Using a murine K14-CreER system, we have found that loss of Tet2 promotes carcinogen-induced squamous cell carcinoma and cooperates with loss of Tp53 to drive spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma tumors in epithelial tissues. Analysis of changes in 5-hmC and gene expression after loss of Tet2 in the epidermis revealed focal alterations in 5-hmC levels and an increase in hair follicle transient amplifying cell genes along with a reduction in epidermal differentiation genes. These results show a role for TET2 in epidermal lineage specification, consistent with reported roles for TET enzymes in controlling lineage commitment in hematopoietic stem cells and embryonic stem cells and establishing TET2 as a bone fide tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

The aims of this multicentre retrospective 'SEIFEM 2016-B' study were as follows: (1) to evaluate the current rate and the outcome of proven/probable IA and (2) to assess the efficacy of AP, in a large 'real life' series of patient with R/R AML submitted to salvage chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 2250 R/R AML patients, a total of 74 cases of IA (5.1%) were recorded as follows: 10 (0.7%) proven and 64 (4.3%) probable. Information about AP were available in 73/74 (99%) patients. Fifty-eight (79%) breakthrough infections occurred, mainly during AP with posaconazole [25 (43%)]. The patients who received AP during salvage chemotherapy showed a benefit from antifungal therapy (AT) than patients who did not received AP [43 (86%) vs 7 (14%); p < .033]. In a multivariate analysis, AP and absence of severe mucositis had a significant favourable effect on overall response rate. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that the incidence of IA during the salvage chemotherapy is similar to the past. Nevertheless, the attributable mortality rate (AMR) appears to be lower than that previously reported in R/R AML. Further prospective studies should be performed to confirm our preliminary observation and understand and the why a decreased AMR is reported in this setting of high-risk patients.",['(c) 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.'],"['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Dragonetti, Giulia', 'Conti, Allegra', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Ballanti, Stelvio', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Lessi, Federica', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Spolzino, Angelica', 'Prezioso, Lucia', 'Delia, Mario', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Decembrino, Nunzia', 'Castagnola, Carlo', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Picardi, Marco', 'Zama, Daniele', 'Orciulo, Enrico', 'Veggia, Barbara', 'Garzia, Mariagrazia', 'Dargenio, Michelina', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Manetta, Sara', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Mancini, Valentina', 'Piedimonte, Monica', 'Tisi, Maria Chiara', 'Toschi, Nicola', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Del Principe MI', 'Dragonetti G', 'Conti A', 'Verga L', 'Ballanti S', 'Fanci R', 'Candoni A', 'Marchesi F', 'Cattaneo C', 'Lessi F', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Spolzino A', 'Prezioso L', 'Delia M', 'Potenza L', 'Decembrino N', 'Castagnola C', 'Nadali G', 'Picardi M', 'Zama D', 'Orciulo E', 'Veggia B', 'Garzia M', 'Dargenio M', 'Melillo L', 'Manetta S', 'Russo D', 'Mancini V', 'Piedimonte M', 'Tisi MC', 'Toschi N', 'Busca A', 'Pagano L']","[""Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita degli Studi di Roma 'Tor Vergata', Roma, Italy."", 'Istituto di Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Here we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 150 ATL cases to reveal the overarching landscape of genetic alterations in ATL. We discovered frequent (33%) loss-of-function alterations preferentially targeting the CIC long isoform, which were overlooked by previous exome-centric studies of various cancer types. Long but not short isoform-specific inactivation of Cic selectively increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in vivo. We also found recurrent (13%) 3'-truncations of REL, which induce transcriptional upregulation and generate gain-of-function proteins. More importantly, REL truncations are also common in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, especially in germinal center B-cell-like subtype (12%). In the non-coding genome, we identified recurrent mutations in regulatory elements, particularly splice sites, of several driver genes. In addition, we characterized the different mutational processes operative in clustered hypermutation sites within and outside immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes and identified the mutational enrichment at the binding sites of host and viral transcription factors suggesting their activities in ATL. By combining the analyses for coding and non-coding mutations, structural variations, and copy number alterations, we discovered 56 recurrently altered driver genes, including 11 novel ones. Finally, ATL cases were classified into two molecular groups with distinct clinical and genetic characteristics based on the driver alteration profile. Our findings not only help to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in ATL, but also provide insights into T-cell biology and have implications for genome-wide cancer driver discovery.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kogure, Yasunori', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Koya, Junji', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Watanabe, Mizuki', 'Saito, Yuki', 'Ito, Yuta', 'McClure, Marni B', 'Tabata, Mariko', 'Shingaki, Sumito', 'Yoshifuji, Kota', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Okada, Ai', 'Kakiuchi, Nobuyuki', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Kamiunten, Ayako', 'Tahira, Yuki', 'Akizuki, Keiichi', 'Sekine, Masaaki', 'Shide, Kotaro', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Kitanaka, Akira', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Nakano, Nobuaki', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Sica, R Alejandro', 'Acuna-Villaorduna, Ana', 'Janakiram, Murali', 'Shah, Urvi A', 'Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Shibata, Tatsuhiro', 'Takeuchi, Kengo', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Ye, B Hilda', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Kataoka, Keisuke']","['Kogure Y', 'Kameda T', 'Koya J', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Nosaka K', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Watanabe M', 'Saito Y', 'Ito Y', 'McClure MB', 'Tabata M', 'Shingaki S', 'Yoshifuji K', 'Chiba K', 'Okada A', 'Kakiuchi N', 'Nannya Y', 'Kamiunten A', 'Tahira Y', 'Akizuki K', 'Sekine M', 'Shide K', 'Hidaka T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Kitanaka A', 'Hidaka M', 'Nakano N', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Sica RA', 'Acuna-Villaorduna A', 'Janakiram M', 'Shah UA', 'Ramos JC', 'Shibata T', 'Takeuchi K', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Matsuoka M', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Miyano S', 'Ogawa S', 'Ye BH', 'Shimoda K', 'Kataoka K']","['National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.', 'Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Keio University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'The Jikei University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Kyoto University, Japan.', 'University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Alabama, Japan.', 'University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine -

This study aimed to advance the understanding of biological characteristics, improve disease stratification, and identify molecular targets of adult B-ALL. Adolescents and young adults (AYA; 15-39 years old, n = 193) and adults (40-64 years old, n = 161) with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL were included in this study. Integrated transcriptomic and genetic analyses were used to classify the cohort into defined subtypes. Of the 323 cases included in the RNA sequencing analysis, 278 (86.1%) were classified into 18 subtypes. The ZNF384 subtype (22.6%) was the most prevalent, with two novel subtypes (CDX2-high and IDH1/2-mut) identified among cases not assigned to the established subtypes. The CDX2-high subtype (3.4%) was characterized by high expression of CDX2 and recurrent gain of chromosome 1q. The IDH1/2-mut subtype (1.9%) was defined by IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R140Q mutations with specific transcriptional and high-methylation profiles. Both subtypes showed poor prognosis and were considered inferior prognostic factors independent of clinical parameters.

METHODS: Analyses were conducted using a semi-Markov model with a 50-year time horizon. Population data from multicenter registry-based studies of Chinese patients with CML-CP informed the model. Transition probabilities were based on time-to-event data from the literature. Utility values were obtained from published studies and were assumed to be the same for patients with and without molecular monitoring. Costs were based on values commonly used in the Chinese healthcare system, including drug acquisition, drug administration, follow-up, treatment for disease progression, molecular monitoring, and terminal care costs, and were in the local currency (2020 Chinese Yuan RMB [ yen]). Outcomes were total life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Molecular monitoring was dominant to no molecular monitoring, with increased LYs (1.52) and QALYs (1.90) and costs savings ( yen93,840) over a lifetime compared to no monitoring in discounted analyses. The opportunity of patients that receive molecular monitoring to discontinue treatment during treatment-free remission, an opportunity not afforded to those without molecular monitoring, was the principle driver of this result. Results were similar across multiple clinical scenarios. Particularly, molecular monitoring remained dominant even if the proportion of patients achieving deep molecular response (DMR) was reduced by 10%-30%, or the proportion of patients maintaining DMR for 1 year was reduced by 10%-30% or increased by 10%. Cost savings in these scenarios ranged from yen62,230 to yen103,964. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this analysis demonstrates that adherence to guideline recommendations of regular molecular monitoring of patients with CML-CP treated with TKIs provides significant clinical benefit that leads to substantial cost savings compared to no molecular monitoring from the perspective of a Chinese payer. In a time where healthcare systems have limited resources to allocate to optimal patient care, investment in molecular monitoring is an ideal choice for improving patient benefits at a reduced cost.",,"['Maheshwari, Vikalp Kumar', 'Slader, Cassandra', 'Dani, Nidhi', 'Gkitzia, Christina', 'Yuan, Quan', 'Xiong, Tengbin', 'Liu, Yu', 'Viana, Ricardo']","['Maheshwari VK', 'Slader C', 'Dani N', 'Gkitzia C', 'Yuan Q', 'Xiong T', 'Liu Y', 'Viana R']","['NBS CONEXTS-Value & Access, Novartis Healthcare Pvt.

BDNF signaling through tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) stimulates neuronal cell survival. For this reason, small molecule TrkB agonists are under pre-clinical develoment for the treatment of a range of neurodegenerative diseases and injuries. Our laboratory recently reported BDNF is secreted by pro-regenerative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) which support hematopoietic reconstitution following total body irradiation (TBI). Here we report BDNF-TrkB signaling plays a novel regenerative role in bone marrow and thymic regeneration following radiation injury. Exogenous administration of BDNF or TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) following myelosuppressive radiation injury promoted faster recovery of mature blood cells and hematopoietic stem cells capable of multi-lineage reconstitution. BDNF promotes hematopoietic regeneration via activation of PDGFRalpha+ bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which increase secretion of hematopoietic cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in response to TrkB activation. These data suggest pharmacologic activation of the BDNF pathway with either BDNF or 7,8-DHF may be beneficial for treatment of radiation or chemotherapy induced myelosuppression.",,"['Sharma, Guru Prasad', 'Frei, Anne C', 'Narayanan, Jayashree', 'Gasperetti, Tracy', 'Veley, Dana', 'Amjad, Asma', 'Albano, Katherine', 'Fish, Brian L', 'Himburg, Heather A']","['Sharma GP', 'Frei AC', 'Narayanan J', 'Gasperetti T', 'Veley D', 'Amjad A', 'Albano K', 'Fish BL', 'Himburg HA']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Cancer Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20211025,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/10/26 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/25 17:22'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 17:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0259042 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-14287 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Oct 25;16(10):e0259042. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0259042. eCollection 2021.,16,10,e0259042,20211203,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', '*Immune Reconstitution', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Radiation Injuries/*metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/*drug effects/metabolism']",PMC8544859,"['U01 AI138331/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI133594/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['The authors have declared no competing interests exist.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3197-4396', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9515-0543', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9676-6371']","['0 (6,7-dihydroxyflavone)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we synthesized gold nanorods (GNRs) of different aspect ratios using a binary surfactant mixture of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium oleate. Following surface functionalization with chitosan and a 12-mer peptide, GNRa-CSP12 measuring 130 x 21 nm(2) was selectively taken up by leukemia cells via targeted endocytosis. Low doses of GNRa-CSP12 inhibited the growth of leukemia cells by disrupting the redox balance and inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, GNRa-CSP12 abrogated endogenous Fe(2+)-dependent m(6)A demethylase activity, which led to global m(6)A hypomethylation and post-transcriptional regulation of downstream genes that are involved in glycolysis, hypoxia, and immune checkpoint pathways. In addition, combination treatment with GNRa-CSP12 and tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) synergistically obviated the m(6)A-mediated TKI resistance phenotype. Finally, GNRa-CSP12 as a potential immunotherapeutic agent could enhance immunotherapy outcome in leukemia.

Plasma cells were first segregated based on their maturation level, but the complexity of this subset might well be underestimated by this simple dichotomy. Indeed, in the last decade new functions have been attributed to plasma cells including but not limited to cytokine secretion. However, a proper characterization of plasma cell heterogeneity has remained elusive partly due to technical issues and cellular features that are specific to this cell type. Cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic signals could be at the origin of this heterogeneity. Recent advances in technologies such as single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, or ChIP-seq on low cell numbers helped to elucidate the fate decision in other cell lineages and similar approaches could be implemented to evaluate the heterogeneous fate of activated B cells in health and disease. Here, we summarized published work shedding some lights on the stimuli and genetic program shaping B-cell terminal differentiation at the single cell level in mice and men. We also discuss the fate and heterogeneity of plasma cells during immune responses, vaccination, and in the frame of human plasma cell disorders.",['(c) 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.'],"['Delaloy, Celine', 'Schuh, Wolfgang', 'Jack, Hans-Martin', 'Bonaud, Amelie', 'Espeli, Marion']","['Delaloy C', 'Schuh W', 'Jack HM', 'Bonaud A', 'Espeli M']","['UMR U1236, INSERM, Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS) de Bretagne, LabEx IGO, Universite de Rennes 1, Rennes, France.', 'French Germinal Center Club, French Society for Immunology (SFI), Paris, France.', 'Division of Molecular Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, Inserm U1160, EMiLy, Paris, 75010, France.', 'The Organization for Partnerships in Leukemia, OPALE Carnot Institute, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'French Germinal Center Club, French Society for Immunology (SFI), Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, Inserm U1160, EMiLy, Paris, 75010, France.', 'The Organization for Partnerships in Leukemia, OPALE Carnot Institute, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211217,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell', 'Germinal center-derived lymphoma', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Plasma cell', 'Single-cell analysis']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/10/25 12:32'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/25 12:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.202149216 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2022 Jan;52(1):10-23. doi: 10.1002/eji.202149216.

LncRNAs play an important role in tumors genesis and progression. According to results from bioinformatics analysis, lncRNA USP30-AS1 is highly expressed in AML and both the high expression of USP30-AS1 and low methylation level at Cg03124318 locus of USP30-AS1 gene promoter are associated with poor prognosis of AML. This study knocked down and overexpressed USP30-AS1 to determine the roles in AML cell lines. High-throughput sequencing was performed to explore the genes regulated by USP30-AS1. Results showed that USP30-AS1 promoted AML cell viability and inhibited apoptosis. Genes regulated by USP30-AS1 are mainly related to genetic regulation and immune system. Among them, USP30 and ANKRD13A genes are close to USP30-AS1 gene in chromosome. Knockdown of USP30, but not ANKRD13A, abolished the cancer-promoting effects of USP30-AS1. ANKRD13A recognizes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain in HLA-I. USP30-AS1 induced HLA-I internalization from the cell membrane by up-regulating ANKRD13A, which might induce the immune escape of AML cells. ChIP analysis revealed that the regulatory effects of USP30-AS1 on USP30 and ANKRD13A are associated with H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac. In summary, USP30-AS1 probably promotes AML cell survival by cis-regulating USP30 and ANKRD13A.",['(c) 2021.

A few literature exists about PICU outcomes in this kind of patients, especially with haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) background. We investigated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients as well as their outcomes. A retrospective, single-centre analytical/observational study was conducted from January 2011 to December 2018 in the PICU of a tertiary care hospital. AL patients from 28 days to 18 years old admitted to the PICU were included, excluding those with histories of HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and microbiology results and outcomes. Forty-three patients with AL required urgent admission (35 lymphoblastic and 8 myeloblastic) for 63 different episodes. The main reasons were sepsis (21, 33.3%), hyperleukocytosis (12, 19%), respiratory failure (11, 17.5%) and seizures (8, 12.7%). Nineteen (30.2%) required inotropic support, and fifteen (23.8%) required mechanical ventilation. Three patients died at the hospital (3/43, 6.9%). Sixty-day mortality was 9.3%, and 1-year mortality was 13.9%. There was no differences regarding the type of AL and 60-day mortality (log-rank 2.652, p = 0.103).Conclusion: In our study, the main cause of admission for AL patients was infection, which was associated to more severity and longer hospital admission. What is Known: * Acute leukaemia is the most common childhood cancer. Admission to a paediatric intensive care unit is required in 30% of children with acute leukaemia. * Regarding the outcomes of children with acute leukaemia that require admission to the intensive care unit data are scarce. What is New: * Mortality in acute leukaemia patients admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit is lower than that of patients with a history of stem cell therapy but higher than that of patients with solid tumours. * The main reason for admission was sepsis, which is related in literature to more severity and long length of stay.","['(c) 2021.

Naive T cells were increased, T cell differentiation was abnormal, and CD40L expression was dysregulated. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutant protein failed DNA binding and pericentromeric targeting. The mutant was fully penetrant and had a dominant-negative effect over WT AIOLOS but not WT IKAROS.

This case series describes the short-term clinical course and disposition of patients who developed asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) at one quaternary pediatric center. METHODS: Clinical data, including laboratory data, inpatient and intensive care unit (ICU) days, imaging findings, presence of complications such as need for ventilation, dialysis, and the development of pleural effusions, and mode of nutrition were abstracted from the medical record of patients with AAP. Pediatric criteria were used to classify episode severity based on the development of organ failure and local complications, such as pancreatic necrosis. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2015, 34 patients had AAP with 43 distinct episodes of pancreatitis. The median inpatient length of stay was 10 days (range 2 to 65). Seven episodes (16.3%) required ICU-level care. Seventeen episodes (39.5%) were severe based on the development of organ failure or presence of pancreatic necrosis. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was used in 17 episodes (39.5%); for 34 episodes (79.1%), patients were discharged on entirely oral feeds. Antibiotics were administered in 20 episodes (46.5%). Pancreatic necrosis was identified within the first week in 12 episodes (27.9%). There were no deaths due to AAP. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course varies widely among patients with AAP. Over 1/3 of the patients in this series developed severe pancreatitis. Although the prognosis of AAP is generally good, many patients develop systemic complications of AAP, requiring TPN or ICU-level care.

However, AI models used for disease classification with MFC data are limited to the panel they were trained on. Thus, a key challenge in deploying AI into routine diagnostics is the robustness and adaptability of such models. This study demonstrates how transfer learning can be applied to boost the performance of models with smaller datasets acquired with different MFC panels. We trained models for four additional datasets by transferring the features learned from our base model. Our workflow increased the model's overall performance and, more prominently, improved the learning rate for small training sizes.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Mallesh, Nanditha', 'Zhao, Max', 'Meintker, Lisa', 'Hollein, Alexander', 'Elsner, Franz', 'Luling, Hannes', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Westermann, Jorg', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Krawitz, Peter M']","['Mallesh N', 'Zhao M', 'Meintker L', 'Hollein A', 'Elsner F', 'Luling H', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W', 'Westermann J', 'Brossart P', 'Krause SW', 'Krawitz PM']","['Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics, University Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics, University Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics and Medical Genetics, Charite University Hospital, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Red Cross Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'res mechanica GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'res mechanica GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Campus Virchow Clinic and Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immuno-oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics, University Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210917,United States,Patterns (N Y),"Patterns (New York, N.Y.)",101767765,,['NOTNLM'],"['FCS data merge', 'classification', 'decision-support', 'deep learning', 'flow cytometry', 'lymphoma', 'neoplasm', 'open source', 'transfer learning']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:48'],"['2021/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.patter.2021.100351 [doi]', 'S2666-3899(21)00206-3 [pii]']",epublish,Patterns (N Y). 2021 Sep 17;2(10):100351. doi: 10.1016/j.patter.2021.100351. eCollection 2021 Oct 8.,2,10,100351,,,PMC8515009,,"['H.L. is a founder and employee of res mechanica; F.E. is an employee of res', 'mechanica; W.K. is a founder and employee of MLL; T.H. is a founder and employee', 'of MLL.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim at analyzing antibody response in ICPs. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Sheba Medical Center, Israel, between January and April 2020, in 1274 participants who received the vaccine, including 1002 ICPs and 272 immunocompetent healthcare workers (HCWs). Antibodies were measured two-four weeks after vaccination by SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain IgG antibodies (RBD IgG) and pseudo-virus neutralization assays. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with vaccine-induced antibody response. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. Findings: RBD-IgG antibodies were detected in 154/156 (98.7%) of patients with HIV, 75/90 (83.3%) with solid malignancies, 149/187 (79.7%) with myeloma, 83/111 (74.8%) following hematopoietic stem cell transplants, 25/36 (69.4%) following liver transplantation, 26/43 (60.5%) with myelodysplastic syndrome, 96/188 (51.0%) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 50/110 (45.5%) following kidney transplantation, 15/80 (18.8%) following heart transplantation, and 269/272 (98.9%) in controls. There was a significant correlation r = 0.74 (95%CI 0.69,0.78) between RBD-binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies in all groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age > 65 years (OR 0.41,95%CI 0.30,0.57) and underlying immunosuppression (OR 0.02,95%CI 0.01,0.07) were significantly associated with a non-reactive response of IgG antibodies. HIV patients showed a similar immunological response as healthy adults. The vaccine was safe without any episodes of rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or allergy. Immunocompetent HCWs experienced significantly more AEs than ICPs. Interpretation: Antibody response to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was highly variable among different ICPs; thus, individual recommendations should be provided for the different immunosuppression states.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Based on cancer genomic databases, we identified human acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia cells with gain-of-function mutations in the Janus kinase (JAK) family as exhibiting high SLFN11 expression. In these cells, the clinical JAK inhibitors cerdulatinib, ruxolitinib, and tofacitinib reduced SLFN11 expression, but IFN did not further induce SLFN11 despite phosphorylated STAT1. We provide evidence that suppression of SLFN11 by JAK inhibitors is caused by inactivation of the non-canonical IFN pathway controlled by AKT and ERK. Accordingly, the AKT and ERK inhibitors MK-2206 and SCH77284 suppressed SLFN11 expression. Both also suppressed the E26 transformation-specific (ETS)-family genes ETS-1 and FLI-1 that act as transcription factors for SLFN11. Moreover, SLFN11 expression was inhibited by the ETS inhibitor TK216. Our study reveals that SLFN11 expression is regulated via the JAK, AKT and ERK, and ETS axis.

As a carrier of essential molecules, especially a group of small non-coding RNAs known as miRNA, recently, EVs have attracted tremendous attention as a prognostic factor. Given the importance of miRNAs in the early stages of leukemogenesis and also their critical parts in the development of drug-resistant phenotype, it seems that the importance of EVs in the development of leukemia is more than what is expected. To be familiar with the clinical value of leukemia-derived EVs, this review aimed to briefly shed light on the biology of EVs and to discuss the role of EV-derived miRNAs in the development of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By elaborating the advances and challenges concerning the isolation of EVs, we discuss whether EVs could have a prognostic value in the clinical setting for leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Izadirad, Huang, Jafari, Hamidieh, Gharehbaghian, Li, Jafari', 'and Chen.']","['Izadirad, Mehrdad', 'Huang, Zoufang', 'Jafari, Farideh', 'Hamidieh, Amir Ali', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad', 'Li, Yi-Dong', 'Jafari, Leila', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng']","['Izadirad M', 'Huang Z', 'Jafari F', 'Hamidieh AA', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Li YD', 'Jafari L', 'Chen ZS']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pediatric Cell and Gene Therapy Research Center, Gene, Cell and Tissue Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Queens, NY, United States.', 'Pediatric Cell and Gene Therapy Research Center, Gene, Cell and Tissue Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Queens, NY, United States.', ""Institute for Biotechnology, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211006,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'disease pathogenesis', 'extracellular vesicles', 'miRNAs', 'non-coding RNAs', 'prognosis factor']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:39'],"['2021/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:39 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.766371 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 6;9:766371. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.766371. eCollection 2021.,9,,766371,,,PMC8527035,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to serologically characterize CMV infection in patients suffering from hematological diseases in Amazonas state, Brazil. Serum samples from 323 patients were tested for the presence of anti-CMV IgM or IgG antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positive samples for IgM were submitted to the IgG avidity test to differentiate primary infection from recurrent infection. An epidemiological questionnaire was administered to collect the sociodemographic information of the study population. The overall prevalence of CMV infection verified in this study was 91.3%. The highest rates were found in patients suffering from platelet disorders (94.5%), anemia (93.3%), or leukemia (91%). The study population was predominantly composed of individuals with low socioeconomic status. Blood transfusions were more common in patients with anemia or leukemia, but this variable was not correlated with the seropositivity for CMV infection. Measurement of IgG avidity in patients positive for anti-CMV IgM demonstrated a recurrent infection rate of 5.2% (17/323). Over 80% of recurrent infections occurred in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or anemia. Our findings indicated that CMV infection is highly prevalent in patients from the western Brazilian Amazon who have hematological diseases. The prevalence observed progressively rose with increasing age, whereas anemia or ALL figured as risk factors for the recurrence of CMV infection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 de Melo Silva, Pinheiro-Silva, Costa de Oliveira, de Castro', 'Alves, Barbosa and Pontes.']","['de Melo Silva, Jean', 'Pinheiro-Silva, Renato', 'Costa de Oliveira, Regiane', 'de Castro Alves, Carlos Eduardo', 'Barbosa, Anderson Nogueira', 'Pontes, Gemilson Soares']","['de Melo Silva J', 'Pinheiro-Silva R', 'Costa de Oliveira R', 'de Castro Alves CE', 'Barbosa AN', 'Pontes GS']","['Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Hematologicas, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Hematologicas, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Hematologicas, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia e Imunologia, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa da Amazonia, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Hematologicas, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia e Imunologia, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa da Amazonia, Manaus, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211007,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Brazilian Amazon', '*cytomegalovirus', '*epidemiology', '*hematological diseases', '*prevalence', '*recurrent infection']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/10/25 06:38'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2021.692226 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2021 Oct 7;9:692226. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.692226. eCollection 2021.,9,,692226,20211026,"['*Anemia', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Prevalence']",PMC8529106,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Material and Methods: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, patients with 10 most common primary cancers and concomitant secondary PCa (diagnosed 2004-2016) were identified and were matched in 1:4 fashion (age, year at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, treatment type, TNM stage) with primary PCa controls. OM was compared between secondary and primary PCa patients and was stratified according to primary cancer type, as well as according to time interval between primary cancer vs. secondary PCa diagnoses. Results: We identified 24,848 secondary PCa patients (skin, n = 3,871; rectal, n = 798; colon, n = 3,665; lymphoma, n = 2,583; leukemia, n = 1,102; pancreatic, n = 118; stomach, n = 361; esophagus, n = 219; liver, n = 160; lung, n = 1,328) vs. 531,732 primary PCa patients. Secondary PCa characteristics were less favorable than those of primary PCa patients (PSA and grade), and smaller proportions of secondary PCa patients received active treatment. After 1:4 matching, all secondary PCa exhibited worse OM than primary PCa patients. Finally, subgroup analyses showed that the survival disadvantage of secondary PCa patients decreased with longer time interval since primary cancer diagnosis and subsequent secondary PCa. Conclusion: Patients with secondary PCa are diagnosed with less favorable PSA and grade. Even after matching for PCa characteristics, secondary PCa patients still exhibit worse survival. However, the survival disadvantage is attenuated, when secondary PCa diagnosis is made after longer time interval, since primary cancer diagnosis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wenzel, Nocera, Wurnschimmel, Colla Ruvolo, Tian, Saad,', 'Briganti, Tilki, Graefen, Becker, Roos, Chun and Karakiewicz.']","['Wenzel, Mike', 'Nocera, Luigi', 'Wurnschimmel, Christoph', 'Colla Ruvolo, Claudia', 'Tian, Zhe', 'Saad, Fred', 'Briganti, Alberto', 'Tilki, Derya', 'Graefen, Markus', 'Becker, Andreas', 'Roos, Frederik C', 'Chun, Felix K H', 'Karakiewicz, Pierre I']","['Wenzel M', 'Nocera L', 'Wurnschimmel C', 'Colla Ruvolo C', 'Tian Z', 'Saad F', 'Briganti A', 'Tilki D', 'Graefen M', 'Becker A', 'Roos FC', 'Chun FKH', 'Karakiewicz PI']","['Department of Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Urology and Division of Experimental Oncology, Urological Research Institute (URI), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Neurosciences, University of Naples Federico II Reproductive Sciences and Odontostomatology, Naples, Italy.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Urology and Division of Experimental Oncology, Urological Research Institute (URI), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montreal Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211006,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['colon cancer', 'lung cancer', 'mortality', 'primary prostate cancer', 'secondary cancer']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:38'],"['2021/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.754996 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 6;11:754996. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.754996. eCollection 2021.,11,,754996,,,PMC8526938,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the roles of ASH1L and its enzymatic activity in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemias are not fully elucidated in Ash1L gene knockout animal models. In this study, we used an Ash1L conditional knockout mouse model to show that loss of ASH1L in hematopoietic progenitor cells impaired the initiation of MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation in vitro. Furthermore, genetic deletion of ASH1L in the MLL-AF9-transformed cells impaired the maintenance of leukemic cells in vitro and largely blocked the leukemia progression in vivo. Importantly, the loss of ASH1L function in the Ash1L-deleted cells could be rescued by wild-type but not the catalytic-dead mutant ASH1L, suggesting the enzymatic activity of ASH1L was required for its function in promoting MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation. At the molecular level, ASH1L enhanced the MLL-AF9 target gene expression by directly binding to the gene promoters and modifying the local histone H3K36me2 levels. Thus, our study revealed the critical functions of ASH1L in promoting the MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis, which provides a molecular basis for targeting ASH1L and its enzymatic activity to treat MLL-AF9-induced leukemias.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Aljazi, Gao, Wu, Mias and He.']","['Aljazi, Mohammad B', 'Gao, Yuen', 'Wu, Yan', 'Mias, George I', 'He, Jin']","['Aljazi MB', 'Gao Y', 'Wu Y', 'Mias GI', 'He J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Nature Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Nature Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Nature Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Nature Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Nature Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASH1L', 'H3K36me2', 'MLL-AF9 fusion', 'MLL1', 'histone modification', 'leukemogenesis']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:38'],"['2021/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.754093 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 8;11:754093. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.754093. eCollection 2021.,11,,754093,,,PMC8534482,['R01 GM127431/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['GM has consulted for Colgate-Palmolive North America.

Mitochondria have been regarded as essential cell elements that fuel the metabolic needs of most cancer cell types. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are a heterogeneous, highly self-renewing, and pluripotent cell population within leukemic cells. The most important source of ATP and metabolites to fulfill the bioenergetics and biosynthetic needs of most cancer stem cells is the mitochondria. In addition, mitochondria have a core role in autophagy and cell death and are the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Overall, growing evidence now shows that mitochondrial activities and pathways have changed to adapt with different types of leukemia, thus mitochondrial metabolism could be targeted for blood malignancy therapy.

TOX is related to the formation of multiple malignancies and contributes to CD8+ T cell exhaustion in solid tumors. However, little is known about the role of TOX genes in hematological malignancies. In this study, we explored the prognostic value of TOX genes from 40 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in a training cohort and validated the results using transcriptome data from 167 de novo AML patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In the training cohort, higher expression of TOX and TOX4 was detected in the AML samples, whereas lower TOX3 expression was found. Moreover, both the training and validation results indicated that higher TOX2, TOX3, and TOX4 expression of AML patients (3-year OS: 0% vs. 37%, P = 0.036; 3-year OS: 4% vs. 61%, P < 0.001; 3-year OS: 0% vs. 32%, P = 0.010) and the AML patients with highly co-expressed TOX, TOX2, TOX4 genes (3-year OS: 0% vs. 25% vs. 75%, P = 0.001) were associated with poor overall survival (OS). Interestingly, TOX2 was positively correlated with CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, and PDL-2 (rs = 0.43, P = 0.006; rs = 0.43, P = 0.006; rs = 0.56, P < 0.001; rs = 0.54, P < 0.001). In conclusion, higher expression of TOX genes was associated with poor OS for AML patients, which was related to the up-regulation of immune checkpoint genes. These data might provide novel predictors for AML outcome and direction for further investigation of the possibility of using TOX genes in novel targeted therapies for AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liang, Zhao, Chen, Huang, Deng, Zeng, Tan, Zha, Chen and Li.']","['Liang, Chaofeng', 'Zhao, Yujie', 'Chen, Cunte', 'Huang, Shuxin', 'Deng, Tairan', 'Zeng, Xiangbo', 'Tan, Jiaxiong', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Liang C', 'Zhao Y', 'Chen C', 'Huang S', 'Deng T', 'Zeng X', 'Tan J', 'Zha X', 'Chen S', 'Li Y']","['Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['TOX', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarker', 'immune checkpoint', 'prognosis']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:38'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.740642 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 8;11:740642. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.740642. eCollection 2021.,11,,740642,,,PMC8532529,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASXL2 is an epigenetic regulator associated with various tumors including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and myeloid leukemia. However, the role of ASXL2 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. This is the first research focusing on the prognostic value of ASXL2 in pancreatic cancer. In this research, we aimed to explore the correlation between ASXL2 and the prognosis, as well as other features in PAAD. We obtained gene expression profiles of PAAD and normal tissues from TCGA, GEO, and Xena databases. TIMER and CIBERSORT algorithms were employed to investigate the effect of ASXL2 on tumor microenvironment. GSEA along with GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted to uncover the biological functions of ASXL2. The response to various chemotherapeutic drugs was estimated by algorithms in R package ""pRRophetic"", while the sensitivity to immunotherapy was quantified by TIDE score. We found that ASXL2 was upregulated in the PAAD samples and elevated expression of ASXL2 was linked to poor overall survival. ASXL2 DNA methylation contributed to ASXL2 expression. Functional annotation indicated that ASXL2 was mainly involved in inflammatory response and epithelial mesenchymal transition. Patients with high ASXL2 expression were more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, gemcitabine, and mitomycin-C. Finally, external datasets and biospecimens were used and the results further validated the aberrant expression of ASXL2 in PAAD samples. In summary, our results highlight that ASXL2 is a potential prognostic and predictive biomarker in pancreatic cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Yang, Gao, Mu, Song, Jiang, Chen and Cui.']","['Wang, Gaoming', 'Yang, Ludi', 'Gao, Jinli', 'Mu, Huiling', 'Song, Yanxiang', 'Jiang, Xiaohua', 'Chen, Bo', 'Cui, Ran']","['Wang G', 'Yang L', 'Gao J', 'Mu H', 'Song Y', 'Jiang X', 'Chen B', 'Cui R']","['Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL2', 'biomarker', 'immunotherapy', 'pancreatic cancer', 'prognosis']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:38'],"['2021/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.736694 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 8;11:736694. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.736694. eCollection 2021.,11,,736694,,,PMC8531590,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, results from different studies are conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis guided by PRISMA 2009 to confirm the efficacy and safety of RIC vs. MAC for AML in CR and MDS. Methods: We search PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane central, clinical trial registries and related websites, major conference proceedings, and field-related journals from January 1, 1980, to July 1, 2020, for studies comparing RIC with MAC before the first allo-HSCT in patients with AML in CR or MDS. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. OS was the primary endpoint and generic inverse variance method was used to combine hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Results: We retrieved 7,770 records. Six RCTs with 1,413 participants (711 in RIC, 702 in MAC) were included. RIC had the same OS (HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.64-1.4, p = 0.80) and cumulative incidence of relapse as MAC (HR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.88-1.59, p = 0.28). Furthermore, RIC significantly reduced non-relapse mortality more than total body irradiation/busulfan-based MAC (HR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.80, p = 0.002) and had similar long-term OS and graft failure as MAC. Conclusion: RIC conditioning regimens are recommended as an adequate option of preparative treatment before allo-HSCT for patients with AML in CR or MDS.

Although chemical biology encompasses a broad field, this review will focus on chemical biology aimed at using exogenous chemical probes to interrogate, modify and manipulate biological processes, at the cellular and organismal levels, in a highly controlled and dynamic manner. In this area, many advances have been achieved for cancer biology and therapeutics, from target identification and validation based on active anticancer compounds (forward approaches) to discoveries of anticancer molecules based on some important targets including protein-protein interaction (reverse approaches). Herein we attempt to summarize some recent progresses mainly from China through applying chemical biology approaches to explore molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Additionally, we also outline several new strategies for chemistry to probe cellular activities such as proximity-dependent labeling methods for identifying protein-protein interactions, genetically encoded sensors, and light activating or repressing gene expression system.","['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

We performed a cohort study to determine the impact of reducing the intensity of remission induction chemotherapy on the outcomes of selected children with AML treated with a low-dose induction regimen plus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (low-dose chemotherapy (LDC)/G-CSF). Complete response (CR) after two induction courses was attained in 87.0% (40/46) of patients receiving LDC/G-CSF. Post-remission therapy was offered to all patients, and included standard consolidation and/or stem cell transplantation. During the study period, an additional 94 consecutive children with AML treated with standard chemotherapy (SDC) for induction (80/94 (85.1%) of the patients attained CR after induction II, P = 0.953) and post-remission. In this non-randomized study, there were no significant differences in 4-year event-free (67.4 vs. 70.7%; P = 0.99) and overall (70.3 vs. 74.6%, P = 0.69) survival in the LDC/G-CSF and SDC cohorts, respectively. After the first course of induction, recovery of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were significantly faster in patients receiving LDC/G-CSF than in those receiving SDC (11.5 vs. 18.5 d for WBCs (P < 0.001); 15.5 vs. 22.0 d for platelets (P < 0.001)). To examine the quality of molecular response, targeted deep sequencing was performed. Of 137 mutations detected at diagnosis in 20 children who attained hematological CR after two courses of LDC/G-CSF (n = 9) or SDC (n = 11), all of the mutations were below the reference value (variant allelic frequency <2.5%) after two courses, irrespective of the treatment group. In conclusion, children with AML receiving LDC/G-CSF appear to have similar outcomes and mutation clearance levels, but significantly lower toxicity than those receiving SDC. Thus, LDC/G-CSF should be further evaluated as an effective alternative to remission induction in pediatric AML.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Differentially expressed mRNA (DEmRNA) transcripts between normal blood and AML blood were identified. Among these, prognosis-associated signature mRNA molecules were screened using univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. A total of four genes, namely, family with sequence similarity 124 member B (FAM124B), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and purinergic receptor P2Y1 (P2RY1), were identified using multivariate Cox regression analysis and were used to construct a prognostic scoring system. Moreover, the expression levels of HPDL and MPO were higher in the samples with high immunity scores and estimate scores (sum of stromal score and immune score), compared with those with low scores. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to confirm the upregulation of the four candidate genes in AML cell lines as well as in clinical AML samples.

Nonetheless, the underlying role of TanIIa in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remains unclear. Here, we revealed that TanIIa drastically inhibited NB4 cell viability with an IC50 value of 31.25 mumol/L. Using flow cytometry apoptosis assay, we identified that TanIIa dose-dependently exacerbated NB4 cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, TanIIa upregulated apoptotic factor levels, namely, cleaved-caspase 9, cleaved-caspase 3, and cleaved-PARP-1. Moreover, we noticed that TanIIa dose-dependently suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis. This axis not only functions as an essential antiapoptotic modulator but also serves as a suppressant regulator of autophagy. Correspondingly, we detected the levels of autophagic marker, namely, LC3B, which were increased after the TanIIa treatment. Furthermore, the autophagy inhibitor Baf-A1 could effectively reverse the TanIIa-induced apoptosis, manifesting that TanIIa eliminated NB4 cells in an autophagy-dependent manner. In conclusion, tanshinone IIa exerts anti-APL effects through triggering autophagy and apoptosis in NB4 cells.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Yiming Pan et al.'],"['Pan, Yiming', 'Chen, Lingyan', 'Li, Ruibai', 'Liu, Yu', 'Nan, Mengdie', 'Hou, Li']","['Pan Y', 'Chen L', 'Li R', 'Liu Y', 'Nan M', 'Hou L']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics, School, Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2021/10/26 06:00,2021/10/26 06:01,['2021/10/25 06:27'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:27 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/3372403 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2021 Oct 15;2021:3372403. doi: 10.1155/2021/3372403. eCollection 2021.,2021,,3372403,,,PMC8536410,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0172-5559', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2921-0821']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the therapeutic benefit of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for Stage IV melanoma, patients with LMD do not typically benefit. A deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of LMD may provide more appropriate therapeutic selection. A retrospective analysis of subjects who underwent surgical resection with LMD (n=8) were profiled with seven color multiplex staining to evaluate the expression of the global immune suppressive hub - the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and for the presence of CD3+ T cells, CD68+ monocyte-derived cells, CD163+ immune suppressive macrophages, and CD11c+ cells [potential dendritic cells (DCs)] in association with the melanoma tumor marker S100B and DAPI for cellular nuclear identification. High-resolution cellular imaging and quantification was conducted using the Akoya Vectra Polaris. CD11c+ cells predominate in the TME (10% of total cells), along with immunosuppressive macrophages (2%). Another potential subset of DCs co-expressing CD11c+ and the CD163+ immunosuppressive marker is frequently present (8/8 of specimens, 8%). Occasional CD3+ T cells are identified, especially in the stroma of the tumor (p=0.039). pSTAT3 nuclear expression is heterogeneous in the various immune cell populations. Occasional immune cluster interactions can be seen in the stroma and on the edge. In conclusion, the TME of LMD is largely devoid of CD3+ T cells but is enriched in immune suppression and innate immunity.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Najem, Marisetty, Horbinski, Long, Huse, Glitza Oliva,', 'Ferguson, Kumthekar, Wainwright, Chen, Lesniak, Burks and Heimberger.']","['Najem, Hinda', 'Marisetty, Anantha', 'Horbinski, Craig', 'Long, James', 'Huse, Jason T', 'Glitza Oliva, Isabella C', 'Ferguson, Sherise D', 'Kumthekar, Priya U', 'Wainwright, Derek A', 'Chen, Peiwen', 'Lesniak, Maciej S', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Heimberger, Amy B']","['Najem H', 'Marisetty A', 'Horbinski C', 'Long J', 'Huse JT', 'Glitza Oliva IC', 'Ferguson SD', 'Kumthekar PU', 'Wainwright DA', 'Chen P', 'Lesniak MS', 'Burks JK', 'Heimberger AB']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern Medicine Malnati Brain Tumor Institute of the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern Medicine Malnati Brain Tumor Institute of the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Melanoma, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Neuro-oncology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern Medicine Malnati Brain Tumor Institute of the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern Medicine Malnati Brain Tumor Institute of the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern Medicine Malnati Brain Tumor Institute of the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern Medicine Malnati Brain Tumor Institute of the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211008,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*LMD', '*STAT3', '*T cells', '*dendritic cells', '*macrophages', '*melanoma', '*tumor microenvironment']",2021/10/26 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/10/25 06:25'],"['2021/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.745893 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 8;12:745893. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.745893. eCollection 2021.,12,,745893,20220111,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'CD11c Antigen/analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/chemistry/*immunology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/immunology/metabolism/*secondary/surgery', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/*secondary/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",PMC8531809,"['F32 NS073366/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 NS082381/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA243707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS120547/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS097851/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 NS082381/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AG068617/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['AH serves on the advisory boards of Caris Life Sciences and WCG Oncology,', 'receives royalties on licensed intellectual property from Celldex Therapeutics', 'and DNAtrix, and received research support from Codiak BioSciences Inc.

Although combination with IL-15 demonstrated the potential to enhance antitumor activity of CAR-T, the efficacy of this approach remains to be validated clinically. Methods: We reported a patient with B-ALL with extramedullary relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and who was resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In total, he received four treatments with CAR-T cells repeatedly under the status of disease progression. Results: First, the patient received autologous murine CAR19-CD28-CD3zeta-T cells and achieved full resolution of extramedullary leukemia lasting 8 months. After systemic disease relapse, he received autologous humanized CAR22-41BB-CD3zeta-tEGFR-T cells and achieved complete remission (CR) with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in the bone marrow and shrinkage of extramedullary leukemia. Over 2 months later, he experienced a relapse of the systemic disease and he received autologous murine CAR19-41BB-CD3zeta-mIL15-T cells and achieved CRiMRD- lasting 5 months with the strongest expansion and persistence of CAR. Finally, on relapse of CD19(-) medullary disease, he received allogeneic humanized CAR22-41BB-CD3zeta-tEGFR-T cells but only achieved a transient decrease in the number of blasts. No CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome was observed, and all side effects were manageable. Conclusion: Our report hints the feasibility and safety of CD19 CAR-T cell expressing membrane-bound IL-15 for patient with B-ALL even if relapsed after multiple CAR-T-cell therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sun, Su, Wang, Liu, Li, Chen, Qiao, Niu, Hu, Zhang, Ning and', 'Hu.']","['Sun, Yao', 'Su, Yongfeng', 'Wang, Yizhi', 'Liu, Na', 'Li, Yuhang', 'Chen, Jianlin', 'Qiao, Zhuoqing', 'Niu, Jingwen', 'Hu, Jiangwei', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Ning, Hongmei', 'Hu, Liangding']","['Sun Y', 'Su Y', 'Wang Y', 'Liu N', 'Li Y', 'Chen J', 'Qiao Z', 'Niu J', 'Hu J', 'Zhang B', 'Ning H', 'Hu L']","[""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211007,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*CD19', '*CD22', '*IL-15', '*chimeric antigen receptor-T cells', '*extramedullary relapse']",2021/10/26 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/10/25 06:25'],"['2021/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/25 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.728962 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 7;12:728962. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.728962. eCollection 2021.,12,,728962,20211227,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retreatment', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8530183,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some patients, the hypodiploid clone undergoes endoreduplication, resulting in doubling of the number of chromosomes and masquerades as a high hyperdiploid BCP-ALL. Karyotyping reveals metaphases with 50-79 chromosomes masking the hypodiploid clone. Identifying hypodiploidy in such cases requires awareness of non random alterations of chromosomal copy numbers found in hypodiploid BCP-ALL. We used a systematic strategy to identify masked hypodiploidy integrating targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis directed towards identifying monosomies of chromosomes 7, 15 and 17 and flow cytometry-based ploidy analysis (FCPA). Of 445 patients diagnosed as BCP ALL, 2.9% (13/445) were classified as hypodiploid including patients with masked hypodiploidy. Karyotype analysis showed hypodiploidy in 3 patients, near triploidy in 4 patients and normal karyotype in 6 patients. Four patients with near triploid clone on karyotype showed either bimodal peak (2 patients) or single low hypodiploid peak (1 patient) or only near triploid peak (1 patient) on FCPA. All 6 patients with normal karyotype revealed either bimodal peak (4 patients) or hypodiploid peak (2 patients) on FCPA. Targeted FISH analysis unmasked hypodiploid clone showing monosomies of chromosomes 7, 15 and 17 in all ten patients. Our algorithm successfully identified masked hypodiploidy in patients, including those with endoreduplication (4 patients) and normal karyotype (6 patients).

The mutation of specific molecular markers, such as fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FTL3) internal tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and nucleophosmin (NPM1), are associated with an adverse and favorable prognosis, respectively. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the prevalence of FLT3/ITD and NPM1 in Chilean patients and their association with clinical data and prognosis. METHOD AND RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-two children were studied between 2011 and 2017, the median being 8.6 years (ranging from 1 to 18 months). Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was diagnosed in 29%. The FLT3/ITD-mutated in non-promyelocytic AML was at 10% (14/133) and the FLT3/TKD, at 3.7% (2/54). In APL, it was at 25.4% (16/63). In non-promyelocytic AML, the FLT3/ITD-mutated was associated with a high leucocyte count, the median being 28.5 x mm(3) (n = 14) versus 19.4 x mm(3) (n = 119), (p = 0.25), in non-mutated cases. In APL, the median was 33.6 x mm3 (n = 15) versus 2.8 x mm3 (n = 47), (p < 0.001). The five-year overall survival (OS) in non-promyelocytic AML with non-mutated and mutated FLT3/ITD were 62.7% and 21.4%, respectively, (p < 0.001); the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) were 79.5% and 50%, respectively, (p < 0.01). The five-year OS in APL with non-mutated and mutated FLT3/ITD was 84.7% and 62.5%, respectively, (p = 0.05); the 5-year EFS was 84.7% and 68.8%, respectively, (p = 0.122). The NPM1 mutation was observed in 3.2% (5/155), all non-promyelocytic AML with the normal karyotype. CONCLUSION: The FLT3/ITD mutation was observed more frequently in APL and associated with a higher white cell count at diagnosis.

However, current treatment strategies mainly based on hypomethylating agent therapy (HMA) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) still leave a lot to be desired. And there is also a lack of studies on large sample with a view to the refinement of specific characteristics and disease progression. So we performed a meta-analysis including 20 studies compromising 5067 patients to assess the prognostic impact and clinical characteristics of TP53 mutations in MDS patients. The overall hazard ratio for overall survival (OS) was 2.14 (95% confidence interval 1.94-2.37, P < .00001) compared with patients with MDS without TP53 mutations. Lower progression-free survival and leukemia-free survival were associated with TP53 mutations. Subgroup analysis revealed that TP53 mutations were significantly associated with high levels of blast cells and karyotypic aberrations. And among Asian population, the adverse impact on OS of TP53 mutations seemed worse than those in Western countries. (HR 2.87 vs. 2.02, P = .01). In addition, TP53 mutations had no effect on response to HMA therapy, and HSCT improved OS in patients carrying TP53 mutations.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, less is known on the impact of HTLV-1 infection in non-ATLL hematologic malignancies. We aimed to investigate if HTLV-1 carriers with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have worse survival outcomes than non-HTLV-1 carriers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study by matching HTLV-1 carriers to non-carriers based on age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, and year of diagnosis. Our outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS and PFS between carriers and non-carriers. We fitted multivariate Cox regression models to assess the mortality and recurrence/disease progression risk of HTLV-1 infection. RESULTS: A total of 188 patients, 66 with HTLV-1 infection and 122 without HTLV-1, were included in the study. HTLV-1 carriers had higher extranodal involvement than non-carriers (47% vs. 27%, P = .010). With a median follow-up of 78 months (95% CI: 41-90 months), HTLV-1 carriers had a similar 5 year OS (41% vs. 42%, P = .940) and PFS (34% vs. 32%, P = .691) compared to non-carriers. In the multivariate Cox analysis, HTLV-1 infection was not associated with worse OS (aHR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.64-1.50) or PFS (aHR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.60-1.34). CONCLUSION: HTLV-1 carriers with DLBCL did not have worse survival outcomes compared to non-carriers. Our results suggest that clinicians should follow standard guidelines for DLBCL management on HTLV-1 seropositive patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

ATO is converted from inorganic arsenic (iAs) to methylated (MAs) and dimethylated (DMAs) metabolites, which are excreted in the urine. Methylation of iAs is important in detoxification, as iAs exposure is deleterious to health. We examined ATO metabolism in 25 APL patients, measuring iAs, MAs, and DMAs. Plasma total iAs increased after ATO administration, followed by a rapid decline, reaching trough levels by 4-6 h. We identified two patterns of iAs metabolism between 6 and 24 h after infusion: in Group 1, iAs increased and were slowly converted to MAs and DMAs, whereas in Group 2, iAs was rapidly metabolized. These patterns were associated with smoking and different treatments: ATO with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone vs. ATO preceded by ATRA and chemotherapy.

Agents such as therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), steroids, rituximab, defibrotide, eculizumab are used in its treatment. The use of treatments such as TPE, steroids, defibrotide, and rituximab did not yield satisfactory results in transplant-associated TMA (TA-TMA).

We aimed to review CD200 expression and its role in the immune evasion of non-B cell hematopoietic neoplasms. In acute myeloid leukemia, CD200 seems to be related to the worst outcome, even in diseases of good prognosis, possibly due to an immunosuppressive effect. In plasma cell myeloma studies, while some have associated CD200 expression with worst prognosis possibly due to its suppressive effect on monocyte and T cell-mediated immune response, in others CD200 appeared to be a marker of a better outcome, or even showed no impact in event-free survival (EFS). Few studies have evaluated CD200 expression in T cell neoplasms; however, it appears to be a good immunophenotypic marker for angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma.

However, there are a limited number of studies concerning its therapeutic mechanism. High performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) analysis showed that the average molecular weight of the S. fusiforme polysaccharide, SFPS 191212, is 43 kDa. SFPS 191212 is composed of mannose, rhamnose, galactose, xylose, glucose, and fucose (at a molar ratio: 2.1 : 2.9 : 1.8 : 15.5 : 4.6 : 62.5) with alpha- and beta-configurations. The present research evaluated the anti-tumor potential of the S. fusiforme polysaccharide in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells in vitro. To explore the SFPS 191212's apoptosis mechanism in HEL cells, transcriptome analysis was performed on HEL cells that were incubated with SFPS 191212. The inhibitory effect of SFPS 191212 on HEL cell growth was also analyzed. It was found that SFPS 191212 inhibited HEL cell proliferation, reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, and induced an insignificant toxic effect on normal human embryonic lung (MRC-5) cells. Compared with the control group, transcriptome analysis identified a total of 598 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 243 up-regulated genes and 355 down-regulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on all DEGs, and 900 GO terms and 52 pathways were found to be significantly enriched. Finally, 23 DEGs were randomly selected and confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, SFPS 191212 down-regulated the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway. Our results provide a framework for understanding the effect of SFPS 191212 on cancer cells and can serve as a resource for delineating the anti-tumor mechanisms of S. fusiforme.","['Copyright (c) 2021 China Pharmaceutical University.

The target compounds were biologically assessed as potent CDK2 inhibitors and promising anti-leukemia hits. The 7-(4-Bromo-phenyl)-3-(3-chloro/2-chloro-phenylazo)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-2-yla mines 5 h and 5i revealed the best CDK2 inhibitory activity with comparable potency (IC50 = 22 and 24 nM, respectively) to that of dinaciclib (IC50 = 18 nM). Additionally, both analogues showed potent activities against CDK1, CDK5 and CDK9 at nanomolar concentrations (IC50 = 28-80 nM). The anti-leukemia screening of the target compounds showed strong to moderate cytotoxicity against the used leukemia cell lines (MOLT-4 and HL-60). Compound 5 h inhibited MOLT-4 and HL-60 by 1.4 and 2.3 folds (IC50 = 0.93 and 0.80 microM), respectively, compared to dinaciclib (IC50 = 1.30 and 1.84 microM). Furthermore, compound 5i was comparable to dinaciclib against MOLT-4 and exhibited twice its activity against HL-60. Besides, the cytotoxicity of the promising analogues on normal human blood cells indicated the safety of 5h and 5i as compared to the reference dinaciclib. The pharmacokinetic properties of 5h and 5i were predicted using ADME calculations revealing good oral bioavailability and high GI absorption. The molecular docking simulations indicated, as expected, that the dinaciclib analogues can well-accommodate the CDK2 binding site, forming a variety of interactions.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Cancers in FA include acute leukemia and solid tumors; the most frequent solid tumor is head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. FA is a primarily autosomal recessive disorder. Several of the genes in which biallelic pathogenic variants cause FA are also autosomal monoallelic cancer predisposition genes e.g. FANCD1 (BRCA2) and FANCN (PALB2). We observed that patients with FA due to biallelic or homozygous pathogenic variants in FANCD1 and FANCN have a unique cancer association. We curated published cases plus our NCI cohort cases, including 71 patients in the FANCD1 group (94 cancers and 69 variants) and 16 patients in the FANCN group (23 cancers and 20 variants). Only patients in FANCD1 and FANCN groups had one or more of these tumors: brain tumors (primarily medulloblastoma), Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma; this is a genotype-specific cancer combination of tumors of embryonal origin. Acute leukemias, seen in all FA genotypes, also occurred in FANCD1 and FANCN group patients at young ages. In silico predictions of pathogenicity for FANCD1 variants were compared with results from a mouse embryonic stem cell-based functional assay. Patients with two null FANCD1 variants did not have an increased frequency of cancer nor earlier onset of cancer compared with those with hypomorphic variants.

The present study's primary objective was to identify factors associated with OS and EFS for consolidative HSCT following CAR-induced complete remission (CR) in transplantation-naive patients. Secondary objectives included evaluation of OS/EFS, relapse-free survival and cumulative incidence of relapse for all patients who proceeded to HSCT, stratified by first and second HSCT, as well as the tolerability of HSCT following CAR-induced remission. This was a retrospective review of children and young adults enrolled on 1 of 3 CAR T cell trials at the National Cancer Institute targeting CD19, CD22, and CD19/22 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01593696, NCT02315612, and NCT03448393) who proceeded directly to HSCT following CAR T cell therapy. Between July 2012 and February 2021, 46 children and young adults with pre-B ALL went directly to HSCT following CAR therapy. Of these patients, 34 (74%) proceeded to a first HSCT, with a median follow-up of 50.8 months. Transplantation-naive patients were heavily pretreated prior to CAR T cell therapy (median, 3.5 lines of therapy; range, 1 to 12) with significant prior immunotherapy exposure (blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and/or CAR T cell therapy in patients receiving CD22 or CD19/22 constructs (88%; 15 of /17)). Twelve patients (35%) had primary refractory disease, and the median time from CAR T cell infusion to HSCT Day 0 was 54.5 days (range, 42 to 127 days). The median OS following first HSCT was 72.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9 months to not estimable [NE]), with a median EFS of 36.9 months (95% CI, 5.2 months to NE). At 12 and 24 months, the OS was 76.0% (95% CI, 57.6% to 87.2%) and 60.7% (95% CI, 40.8% to 75.8%), respectively, and EFS was 64.6% (95% CI, 46.1% to 78.1%) and 50.9% (95% CI, 32.6% to 66.6%), respectively. The individual factors associated with both decreased OS and EFS in univariate analyses for post-CAR consolidative HSCT in transplantation-naive patients included >/=5 prior lines of therapy (not reached [NR] versus 12.4 months, P = .014; NR versus 4.8 months, P = .063), prior blinatumomab therapy (NR versus 16.9 months, P = .0038; NR versus 4.4 months, P = .0025), prior inotuzumab therapy (NR versus 11.5 months, P = .044; 36.9 months versus 2.7 months, P = .0054) and >/=5% blasts (M2/M3 marrow) pre-CAR T cell therapy (NR versus 17 months, P = .019; NR versus 12.2 months, P = .035). Primary refractory disease was associated with improved OS/EFS post-HSCT (NR versus 21.9 months, P = .075; NR versus 12.2 months, P = .024). Extensive prior therapy, particularly immunotherapy, and high disease burden each individually adversely impacted OS/EFS following post-CAR T cell consolidative HSCT in transplantation-naive patients, owing primarily to relapse. Despite this, HSCT remains an important treatment modality in long-term cure. Earlier implementation of HSCT before multiply relapsed disease and incorporation of post-HSCT risk mitigation strategies in patients identified to be at high-risk of post-HSCT relapse may improve outcomes.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Molina, John C', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Yates, Bonnie', 'Lee, Daniel W', 'Little, Lauren', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Shalabi, Haneen', 'Shah, Nirali N']","['Molina JC', 'Steinberg SM', 'Yates B', 'Lee DW', 'Little L', 'Mackall CL', 'Shalabi H', 'Shah NN']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Biostatistics and Data Management Section, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, California; Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California; Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

The P2X7 receptor is an ATP-gated ion channel known for its cytotoxic activity. However, P2X7 receptors also play important roles in the growth of cancer and the immune regulation. Functional P2X7 receptor is widely expressed in murine and human hematopoietic stem cells and their lineages, including monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and B or T lymphocytes, and participates in various physiological and pathologic activities. Therefore, it is not surprising that the P2X7 receptor is important for the normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Here, we summarize the biological functions of P2X7 receptor during both normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. In particular, we found that ATP levels are dramatically increased in the leukemic bone marrow niche and the fates of leukemia-initiating cells of acute myeloid leukemia are tightly controlled by P2X7 expression and ATP-P2X7-mediated signaling pathways. These findings strongly indicate that the P2X7 receptor may be considered a potential biomarker of hematological malignancies in bone marrow niches, and its antagonists may be useful for the leukemia treatment in addition to the traditional chemotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Monitoring the peripheral blood blast burden during induction by flow cytometry has shown significant value in the evaluation of treatment responses. Our previous study reported the day 5 peripheral blast clearance rate (D5-PBCR) as an indicator of early treatment response, and D5-PBCR (+) patients showed poor outcomes. We performed the present phase 2 trial of early intervention in D5-PBCR (+) patients with homoharringtonine (HHT) introduced in the traditional induction regimen with anthracycline and cytarabine. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR). This study enrolled 151 patients, 65 patients were D5-PBCR (+) and 55 patients completed induction with HHT addition. The overall CR rate after one course of induction was 84.4%, with 87.5% and 80.0% for the D5-PBCR (-) and D5-PBCR (+) groups, respectively. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was comparable between the two groups. At the median follow-up of 53.1 months, median overall survival (OS) was not reached in the entire cohort, and median event-free survival (EFS) was 42.2 months. Neither the OS nor EFS showed significant differences between the D5-PBCR (-) and D5-PBCR (+) groups. Compared to historical data, significant improvements in both OS (p = .020) and EFS (p = .020) were observed in the D5-PBCR (+) group. In conclusion, optimization of induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine according to D5-PBCR is feasible in patients with newly diagnosed AML.

However, the clinical application of gammadeltaT cells has been hampered by their relatively low abundance in vivo and the technical difficulty of inducing their differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro. Here, we describe a novel method for generating mouse gammadeltaT cells by co-culturing HSC-enriched bone marrow cells (HSC-eBMCs) with induced thymic epithelial cells (iTECs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We used BMCs from CD45.1 congenic C57BL/6 mice to distinguish them from iPSCs, which expressed CD45.2. We showed that HSC-eBMCs and iTECs cultured with IL-2 + IL-7 for up to 21 days induced CD45.1(+) gammadeltaT cells that expressed a broad repertoire of Vgamma and Vdelta T-cell receptors. Notably, the induced lymphocytes contained few or no alphabetaT cells, NK1.1(+) natural killer cells, or B220(+) B cells. Adoptive transfer of the induced gammadeltaT cells to leukemia-bearing mice significantly reduced tumour growth and prolonged mouse survival with no obvious side effects, such as tumorigenesis and autoimmune diseases. This new method suggests that it could also be used to produce human gammadeltaT cells for clinical applications.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

A phase II trial demonstrated in vivo safety and efficacy of BEZ and MPA (BaP) in elderly, relapsed/refractory AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. However, we observed dose-limiting toxicities in a second trial that attempted to improve outcomes via escalation of BaP doses. Thus we sought to identify a third repurposed drug that potentiates activity of low dose BaP (BaP 0.1 mM). METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate that addition of a commonly used anti-epileptic, valproic acid (VAL) to low dose BaP (BaP 0.1 mM)(VBaP) enhanced killing of AML cell lines/primary AML cells to levels similar to high dose BaP (BaP 0.5 mM). Similarly, addition of VAL to BaP 0.1 mM enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Overexpression of Nrf2 in K562 and KG1a completely inhibited ROS production and rescued cells from VAL/BaP 0.1 mM/VBaP killing. CONCLUSIONS: Given the good safety data of low-dose BaP in elderly/relapsed/refractory AML patients, and that VAL alone is well-tolerated, we propose VBaP as a novel therapeutic combination for AML.",['(c) 2021.

Here we show that the CBFB-MYH11 (CM) fusion gene upregulates miR-126 expression through aberrant miR-126 transcription and perturbed miR-126 biogenesis via the HDAC8/RAN-XPO5-RCC1 axis. Aberrant miR-126 upregulation promotes survival of leukemia-initiating progenitors and is critical for initiating and maintaining CM-driven AML. We show that miR-126 enhances MYC activity through the SPRED1/PLK2-ERK-MYC axis. Notably, genetic deletion of miR-126 significantly reduces AML rate and extends survival in CM knock-in mice. Therapeutic depletion of miR-126 with an anti-miR-126 (miRisten) inhibits AML cell survival, reduces leukemia burden and leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity in inv(16) AML murine and xenograft models. The combination of miRisten with chemotherapy further enhances the anti-leukemia and anti-LSC activity. Overall, this study provides molecular insights for the mechanism and impact of miR-126 dysregulation in leukemogenesis and highlights the potential of miR-126 depletion as a therapeutic approach for inv(16) AML.",['(c) 2021.

The methyltransferase DNMT3A is a key regulator of DNA methylation. Although DNMT3A somatic mutations in CLL are rare, we found that low DNMT3A expression is associated with more aggressive disease. A conditional knockout mouse model showed that homozygous depletion of Dnmt3a from B cells results in the development of CLL with 100% penetrance at a median age of onset of 5.3 months, and heterozygous Dnmt3a depletion yields a disease penetrance of 89% with a median onset at 18.5 months, confirming its role as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. B1a cells were confirmed as the cell of origin of disease in this model, and Dnmt3a depletion resulted in focal hypomethylation and activation of Notch and Myc signaling. Amplification of chromosome 15 containing the Myc gene was detected in all CLL mice tested, and infiltration of high-Myc-expressing CLL cells in the spleen was observed. Notably, hyperactivation of Notch and Myc signaling was exclusively observed in the Dnmt3a CLL mice, but not in three other CLL mouse models tested (Sf3b1-Atm, Ikzf3, and MDR), and Dnmt3a-depleted CLL were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with these findings, human CLL samples with lower DNMT3A expression were more sensitive to Notch inhibition than those with higher DNMT3A expression. Altogether, these results suggest that Dnmt3a depletion induces CLL that is highly dependent on activation of Notch and Myc signaling. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss of DNMT3A expression is a driving event in CLL and is associated with aggressive disease, activation of Notch and Myc signaling, and enhanced sensitivity to Notch inhibition.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Biran, Anat', 'Yin, Shanye', 'Kretzmer, Helene', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Parvin, Salma', 'Lucas, Fabienne', 'Uduman, Mohamed',

The primary aim was to examine the use of lectin complement pathway proteins as markers to differentiate ALLarthropathy from JIA. The secondary aims were to compare the protein levels at baseline and follow-up in a paired number of children with ALL and to examine the correlation with haematology counts, erythrocyte sedimentation reaction (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), blasts, relapse and death. STUDY DESIGN: In this observational study, we measured M-ficolin, CL-K1 and MASP-3 in serum from children with ALL (n=151) and JIA (n=238) by time-resolved immunofluorometric assays. Logistic regression was used for predictions of ALL risk, considering the markers as the respective exposures. We performed internal validation using repeated '10-fold cross-validation' with 100 repetitions computing the area under the curve (AUC) as well as positive and negative predictive values in order to evaluate the predictive performance. RESULTS: The level of M-ficolin was higher in JIA than ALLtotal and the ALLarthropathy subgroup. The M-ficolin level normalised after remission of ALL. M-ficolin could differentiate ALL from JIA with an AUC of 94% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 95%, exceeding CRP and haemoglobin. In a dichotomised predictive model with optimal cut-offs for M-ficolin, platelets and haemoglobin, AUC was 99% and PPV 98% in detecting ALL from JIA. CONCLUSION: M-ficolin is a valuable marker to differentiate the child with ALL from JIA.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No', 'commercial re-use.

We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate, among patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia who received intensive induction with CPX-351, if the AML-Score associates with (1) complete remission (CR) and (2) early mortality (EM) within 60 days of induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We abstracted demographic and clinical data from consecutive patients receiving CPX-351 at Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital between September 2017 and November 2020. We used descriptive statistics and receiver operating curves to evaluate the relationship between AML-Score and rates of CR and EM. RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were included. 27 (67.5%) were male, 27 (67.5%) were white, 36 (90.0%) were not Hispanic or Latino, and 29 (72.5%) were aged >/=60 years. Twenty-seven patients (67.5%) had a CR, and 4 (10%) experienced EM. Observed rates of CR and EM generally increased with increasing predicted risk. The area under the curve was 0.75 (95% CI 0.60-0.90) for CR and 0.82 (95% CI 0.68-0.96) for EM. CONCLUSION: The AML-Score tool trends in the correct direction for predicting CR and EM, and thus may facilitate oncologist prognostication and treatment planning for patients receiving CPX-351. However, its clinical utility is limited by its underestimation of the risk of CR and overestimation of the risk of EM. Further validation in a larger cohort is needed to calculate accurate point estimates of CR and EM risk in this population.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: LTBFL patients were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously; day 1 of 4 7-day cycles). Patients achieving disease control entered a 2-year maintenance period. CT-P10 or rituximab were administered every 8 weeks (6 cycles) in year 1; all patients could receive CT-P10 (every 8 weeks; 6 cycles) in year 2. Secondary endpoints (reported here) were overall response rate (ORR) during the study period, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated. RESULTS: Between November 9, 2015 and January 4, 2018, 258 patients were randomized (130 for CT-P10; 128 for rituximab). ORR was similar between groups over the study period (CT-P10: 88%; rituximab: 87%). After 29.2 months' median follow-up, median PFS, TTP, and OS were not estimable; 24-month Kaplan-Meier estimates suggested similarity between groups. Overall, 114 (CT-P10: 88%), and 104 (rituximab: 81%) patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events. The single switch was well tolerated.

Haematological examination revealed the presence of blast cells, decreased lymphocytes, mild thrombocytopenia and anaemia but no leucocytosis. Serum analyses detected elevated aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities and triglyceride concentrations. Twenty-two days after the initial visit, the horse died after showing clinical signs of decreased appetite, increased body temperature, tachypnoea and tachycardia. At necropsy, there was mild splenomegaly but enlarged lymph nodes, masses or nodules were not seen in any organ. Histologically, neoplastic cells were seen in the subcapsular and medullary lymph sinus of the mediastinal, axillary, mesenteric and renal lymph nodes. The bone marrow was densely cellular with numerous large round neoplastic cells that had round nuclei with clear nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. The neoplastic cells were immunopositive for CD3 but negative for CD20, BLA36, CD204, Iba-1, CD204 and granzyme B.

However, gilteritinib may be associated with underrecognized cardiotoxicities. CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes a patient with a history significant for hyperlipidemia who was diagnosed with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. After four doses of gilteritinib monotherapy, she abruptly developed acute systolic heart failure with global hypokinesis and septal wall motion abnormalities. Two days after discontinuation, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed partial recovery of her left ventricular ejection fraction as well as myocardial edema and non-ischemic fibrosis suggestive of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. She underwent intravenous diuresis and eventually started guideline-directed heart failure therapy. Follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance imaging five months later showed improved ejection fraction with mild non-ischemic fibrosis and resolution of myocardial edema and inflammation. She later received an allogeneic stem cell transplant from a matched unrelated donor. CONCLUSIONS: Gilteritinib may be associated with early cardiotoxicities, including non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be an important modality to help differentiate or diagnose early cardiotoxicities associated with novel targeted therapies.",['(c) 2021.

Chronic isolated neutropenia represents the clinical hallmark of the disease, being present in up to 80% of cases. New advances were made in the biological characterization of neutropenia in these patients, in particular STAT3 mutations and a discrete immunophenotype are now recognized as relevant features. Nevertheless, the etiology of LGLL-related neutropenia is not completely elucidated and several mechanisms, including humoral abnormalities, bone marrow infiltration/substitution and cell-mediated cytotoxicity might cooperate to its pathogenesis. As a consequence of the multifactorial nature of LGLL-related neutropenia, a targeted therapeutic approach for neutropenic patients has not been developed yet; moreover, specific guidelines based on prospective trials are still lacking, thus making the treatment of this disorder a complex and challenging task. Immunosuppressive therapy represents the current, although poorly effective, therapeutic strategy. The recent identification of a STAT3-mediated miR-146b down-regulation in neutropenic T-LGLL patients emphasized the pathogenetic role of STAT3 activation in neutropenia development. Accordingly, JAK/STAT3 axis inhibition and miR-146b restoration might represent tempting strategies and should be prospectively evaluated for the treatment of neutropenic LGLL patients.",,"['Calabretto, Giulia', 'Teramo, Antonella', 'Barila, Gregorio', 'Vicenzetto, Cristina', 'Gasparini, Vanessa Rebecca', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Calabretto G', 'Teramo A', 'Barila G', 'Vicenzetto C', 'Gasparini VR', 'Semenzato G', 'Zambello R']","['Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35129 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20211019,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT3', '*immunosuppressive therapy', '*large granular lymphocytes', '*neutropenia']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:23'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:23 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10102800 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10102800 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Oct 19;10(10). pii: cells10102800. doi: 10.3390/cells10102800.,10,10,,20211203,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*complications/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/*complications/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",PMC8534439,['IG-20216/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8646-2932', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3430-6115', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8689-3759']",['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to their self-renewal and differentiation capacity, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a potential source of short in supply disease-specific human cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Patient-derived iPSCs can recapitulate the disease severity and spectrum of prognosis dictated by the genetic variation among patients and can be used for drug screening and studying clonal evolution. However, this approach lacks the ability to model the early phases of the disease leading to cancer. The advent of genetic editing technology has promoted the generation of precise isogenic iPSC disease models to address questions regarding the underlying genetic mechanism of disease initiation and progression. In this review, we discuss the use of iPSC disease modeling in hematological diseases, where there is lack of patient sample availability and/or difficulty of engraftment to generate animal models. Furthermore, we describe the power of combining iPSC and precise gene editing to elucidate the underlying mechanism of initiation and progression of various hematological malignancies. Finally, we discuss the power of iPSC disease modeling in developing and testing novel therapies in a high throughput setting.",,"['Sidhu, Ishnoor', 'Barwe, Sonali P', 'Pillai, Raju K', 'Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar']","['Sidhu I', 'Barwe SP', 'Pillai RK', 'Gopalakrishnapillai A']","[""Nemours Centers for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer & Blood Disorders, Nemours Children's Health, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA."", 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711, USA.', ""Nemours Centers for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer & Blood Disorders, Nemours Children's Health, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA."", 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711, USA.', 'National Medical Center, Department of Pathology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91105, USA.', ""Nemours Centers for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer & Blood Disorders, Nemours Children's Health, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA."", 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20211009,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*gene editing', '*hematologic', '*iPSC']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:22'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10102698 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10102698 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Oct 9;10(10). pii: cells10102698. doi: 10.3390/cells10102698.,10,10,,20211203,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Editing', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism']",PMC8534597,"['ununmbered/Lisa Dean Moseley Foundation, Nemours Foundation, Leukemia Research', 'Foundation of Delaware']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4162-3004', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0465-578X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its physiological role in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Tumor cells block apoptosis to escape cell death so that they can proliferate indefinitely, leading to ineffective therapy for cancer patients. In this study, we investigated whether Oct4 regulates the apoptosis pathway and contributes to poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Our results revealed that Oct4 expression is correlated with Stat1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients and Oct4 is directly bound to the Stat1 promoter to transactivate Stat1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Expression of the Stat1 downstream gene Mcl-1 increased in Oct4-overexpressing cancer cells, while Stat1 knockdown in Oct4-overexpressing cancer cells sensitized them to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Oct4 promoted Stat1 expression and tumor growth, whereas silencing of Stat1 reduced Oct4-induced tumor growth in human lung tumor xenograft models. Taken together, we demonstrate that Oct4 is a pro-survival factor by inducing Stat1 expression and that the Oct4/Stat1/Mcl-1 axis may be a potential therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.",,"['Su, Yu-Chu', 'Chen, Yi-Cheng', 'Tseng, Yau-Lin', 'Shieh, Gia-Shing', 'Wu, Pensee', 'Shiau, Ai-Li', 'Wu, Chao-Liang']","['Su YC', 'Chen YC', 'Tseng YL', 'Shieh GS', 'Wu P', 'Shiau AL', 'Wu CL']","['Department of Otolaryngology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70403, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chiayi Christian Hospital, Chiayi 60002, Taiwan.', 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Tainan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Executive Yuan, Tainan 70043, Taiwan.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, School of Medicine, Keele University, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, UK.', 'Academic Unit of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital of North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire ST4 6QG, UK.', 'Department of Medical Research, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chiayi Christian Hospital, Chiayi 60002, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chiayi Christian Hospital, Chiayi 60002, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211003,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mcl-1', '*Oct4', '*Stat1', '*anti-apoptosis', '*cell survival', '*lung adenocarcinoma']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:22'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10102642 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10102642 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Oct 3;10(10). pii: cells10102642. doi: 10.3390/cells10102642.,10,10,,20211203,"['Adenocarcinoma of Lung/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC8534205,"['MOST103-2320-B-006-047-MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0011-5636', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7821-9406']","['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Irradiation damages tumor cells and augments tumor immunotherapy in clinical applications. However, the radiotherapy-mediated molecular mechanism affecting CD8(+) T cell activity remains elusive. We aimed to uncover the mechanism of radiotherapy augmenting cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR-positive NSCLC cell lines were co-cultured with CD8(+) T cells from healthy volunteers. Tumor cell viability and apoptosis were consequently measured. IFNgamma was identified secreted by CD8(+) T cells and PBMCs. Therefore, RNAseq was used to screen the IFNgamma-mediated gene expression in A549 cells. The irradiation effect to IFNgamma-mediated gene expression was investigated using qPCR and western blots. We found that the co-culture of tumor cells stimulated the increase of granzyme B and IFNgamma in CD8(+) T, but A549 exhibited resistance against CD8(+) T cytotoxicity compared to HCC827. Irradiation inhibited A549 proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, augmenting PBMCs-mediated cytotoxicity against A549. We found that IFNgamma simultaneously increased phosphorylation on STAT1 and STAT3 in EGFR-positive lung cancer, resulting in overexpression of PD-L1 (p < 0.05). In RNAseq analysis, MCL1 was identified and increased by the IFNgamma-STAT3 axis (p < 0.05). We demonstrated that irradiation specifically inhibited phosphorylation on STAT1 and STAT3 in IFNgamma-treated A549, resulting in reductions of PD-L1 and MCL1 (both p < 0.05). Moreover, knockdowns of STAT3 and MCL1 increased the PBMCs-mediated anti-A549 effect. This study demonstrated that A549 expressed MCL1 to resist CD8(+) T cell-mediated tumor apoptosis. In addition, we found that irradiation suppressed IFNgamma-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and PD-L1 and MCL1 expression, revealing a potential mechanism of radiotherapy augmenting immune surveillance.",,"['Wang, Chun-I', 'Chang, Yi-Fang', 'Sie, Zong-Lin', 'Ho, Ai-Sheng', 'Chang, Jung-Shan', 'Peng, Cheng-Liang', 'Cheng, Chun-Chia']","['Wang CI', 'Chang YF', 'Sie ZL', 'Ho AS', 'Chang JS', 'Peng CL', 'Cheng CC']","['Radiation Biology Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou 333, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei 104, Taiwan.', 'Laboratory of Good Clinical Research Center, Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Tamsui District, New Taipei City 251, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei City 252, Taiwan.', 'Radiation Biology Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou 333, Taiwan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Atomic Energy Council, Taoyuan 325, Taiwan.', 'Radiation Biology Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou 333, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210923,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8+ T cells', '*MCL1', '*PD-L1', '*STAT1', '*STAT3', '*irradiation', '*non-small-cell lung cancer', '*radiotherapy']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:22'],"['2021/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10102515 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10102515 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Sep 23;10(10). pii: cells10102515. doi: 10.3390/cells10102515.,10,10,,20211213,"['B7-H1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', '*Radiotherapy/methods']",PMC8533912,"['MOST 109-2314-B-182-011/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'MOST 110-2314-B-182-031/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'MOST 110-2314-B-182-003-MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8332-0162', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3063-9927', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6455-1798']","['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used the model of immunodeficient NSG mice reconstituted with a functional human immune system (HIS) to investigate early events in HTLV-1 pathogenesis. Upon infection, human T-cells rapidly increased in the blood and lymphoid tissues, particularly CD4(+)CD25(+) T-cells. Proliferation of CD4(+) T-cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) correlated with HTLV-1 proviral load and CD25 expression. In addition, splenomegaly, a common feature of ATLL in humans, was also observed. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells predominantly displayed an effector memory phenotype (CD45RA(-)CCR7(-)) and expressed CXCR3 and CCR5 chemokine receptors, suggesting the polarization into a Th1 phenotype. Activated CD8(+) T-cells expressed granzyme B and perforin; however, the interferon-gamma response by these cells was limited, possibly due to elevated PD-1 expression and increased frequency of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T-cells in MLN. Thus, HTLV-1-infected HIS-NSG mice reproduced several characteristics of infection in humans, and it may be helpful to investigate ATLL-related events and to perform preclinical studies. Moreover, aspects of chronic infection were already present at early stages in this experimental model.

This study for the first time demonstrates the potential of Raman spectroscopy to sense the resistant phenotype. Currently recommended resistance screening strategy include detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts, kinase domain mutations, complex chromosomal abnormalities and BCR-ABL1 gene amplification. The techniques used for these tests are expensive, technologically demanding and have limited availability in resource-poor countries. In India, this could be a reason for more patients reporting to clinics with advanced disease. A single method which can identify resistant cells irrespective of the underlying mechanism would be a practical screening strategy. During our analysis of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant K562 cells, by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), copy number variations specific to resistant cells were detected. aCGH is technologically demanding, expensive and therefore not suitable to serve as a single economic test. We therefore explored whether DNA finger-print analysis of Raman hyperspectral data could capture these alterations in the genome, and demonstrated that it could indeed segregate imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells. Raman spectroscopy, due to availability of portable instruments, ease of spectrum acquisition and possibility of centralized analysis of transmitted data, qualifies as a preliminary screening tool in resource-poor countries for imatinib resistance in CML. This study provides a proof of principle for a single assay for monitoring resistance to imatinib, available for scrutiny in clinics.",,"['Mojidra, Rahul', 'Hole, Arti', 'Iwasaki, Keita', 'Noothalapati, Hemanth', 'Yamamoto, Tatsuyuki', 'C, Murali Krishna', 'Govekar, Rukmini']","['Mojidra R', 'Hole A', 'Iwasaki K', 'Noothalapati H', 'Yamamoto T', 'C MK', 'Govekar R']","['Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, BARC Training School Complex, Mumbai 400094, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai 410210, India.', 'The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Tottori University, Tottori 680-8550, Japan.', 'Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Shimane University, Matsue 690-8504, Japan.', 'Raman Project Center for Medical and Biological Applications, Shimane University, Matsue 690-8504, Japan.', 'Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Shimane University, Matsue 690-8504, Japan.', 'Raman Project Center for Medical and Biological Applications, Shimane University, Matsue 690-8504, Japan.', 'Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, BARC Training School Complex, Mumbai 400094, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai 410210, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, BARC Training School Complex, Mumbai 400094, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210922,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*MCR analysis', '*Raman spectroscopy', '*array comparative genomic hybridization', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*resistance screening']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:22'],"['2021/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10102506 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10102506 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Sep 22;10(10). pii: cells10102506. doi: 10.3390/cells10102506.,10,10,,20211213,"['Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', '*DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",PMC8533852,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7103-9784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3908-2272', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8279-7716', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4974-8533']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we screened a library containing 9600 core compounds and obtained STK160830 that shows anti-apoptotic effects in irradiated wild-type-p53-bearing human T-cell leukemia MOLT-4 cells and murine thymocytes. In many of the p53-impaired cells and p53-knockdown cells tested, STK160830 did not show a remarkable anti-apoptotic effect, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic activity is p53-dependent. In the expression analysis of p53, p53-target gene products, and reference proteins by immunoblotting, STK160830 down-regulated the expression of many of the proteins examined, and the downregulation correlated strongly with its inhibitory effect on cell death. mRNA expression analyses by qPCR and nascent RNA capture kit revealed that STK160830 showed a decreased mRNA expression, which was similar to that induced by the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D but differed to some extent. Furthermore, unlike other RNA synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D, p53 accumulation by STK160830 alone was negligible, and a DNA melting-curve analysis showed very weak DNA-intercalating activity, indicating that STK160830 is a useful inhibitor for RNA synthesis without triggering p53-mediated damage responses.",,"['Morita, Akinori', 'Ochi, Shintaro', 'Satoh, Hidetoshi', 'Ujita, Shohei', 'Matsushita, Yosuke', 'Tada, Kasumi', 'Toyoda, Mihiro', 'Nishiyama, Yuichi', 'Mizuno, Kosuke', 'Deguchi, Yuichi', 'Suzuki, Keiji', 'Tanaka, Yoshimasa', 'Ueda, Hiroshi', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Hosoi, Yoshio', 'Aoki, Shin']","['Morita A', 'Ochi S', 'Satoh H', 'Ujita S', 'Matsushita Y', 'Tada K', 'Toyoda M', 'Nishiyama Y', 'Mizuno K', 'Deguchi Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Ueda H', 'Inaba T', 'Hosoi Y', 'Aoki S']","['Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal and Life Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.', 'Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.', 'Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Tokushima University, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal and Life Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.', 'Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.', 'Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.', 'Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.', 'Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal and Life Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,Switzerland,Life (Basel),"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",101580444,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA intercalator', 'RNA synthesis inhibitor', 'apoptosis', 'p53']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:22'],"['2021/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['life11101087 [pii]', '10.3390/life11101087 [doi]']",epublish,Life (Basel). 2021 Oct 15;11(10). pii: life11101087. doi: 10.3390/life11101087.,11,10,,,,PMC8539076,['19H03604 and 16K10396/KAKENHI'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9988-6136', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8960-6110', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5024-0614', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4287-6487']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to find out if the introduction of the methoxy group into the aromatic ring affects in vitro anti-tumor potency of the investigated lactones. METHODS: Cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects were assessed with cytometric tests with propidium iodide, annexin V, and Western blot techniques. We also investigated potential synergistic potency of the tested lactones and glucocorticoids in canine lymphoma/leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: The tested flavanone-derived lactones showed anti-cancer activity in vitro. Depending on its location, the methoxy group either increased or decreased cytotoxicity of the derivatives as compared with the parent compound. The most potent lactone was the one with the methoxy group at position 4' of the B ring (compound 3), and the weakest activity was observed when the group was located at C-8 in the A ring. A combination of the lactones with glucocorticoids confirmed their synergy in anti-tumor activity in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Methoxy-substituted flavanone-derived lactones effectively kill canine lymphoma/leukemia cells in vitro and, thanks to their synergistic action with glucocorticoids, may potentially be applied in the treatment of hematopoietic cancers.",,"['Pawlak, Aleksandra', 'Henklewska, Marta', 'Hernandez-Suarez, Beatriz', 'Siepka, Monika', 'Gladkowski, Witold', 'Wawrzenczyk, Czeslaw', 'Motykiewicz-Pers, Karolina', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz, Bozena']","['Pawlak A', 'Henklewska M', 'Hernandez-Suarez B', 'Siepka M', 'Gladkowski W', 'Wawrzenczyk C', 'Motykiewicz-Pers K', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz B']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, C.K.

Polymorphism in bovine lymphocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 alleles is related to susceptibility to BLV proviral load (PVL), which is a useful index for estimating disease progression and transmission risk. However, whether differential BoLA-DRB3 affects BLV infectivity remains unknown. In a three-year follow-up investigation using a luminescence syncytium induction assay for evaluating BLV infectivity, we visualized and evaluated the kinetics of BLV infectivity in cattle with susceptible, resistant and neutral BoLA-DRB3 alleles which were selected from 179 cattle. Susceptible cattle showed stronger BLV infectivity than both resistant and neutral cattle. The order of intensity of BLV infectivity was as follows: susceptible cattle > neutral cattle > resistant cattle. BLV infectivity showed strong positive correlation with PVL at each testing point. BLV-infected susceptible cattle were found to be at higher risk of horizontal transmission, as they had strong infectivity and high PVL, whereas BLV-infected resistant cattle were low risk of BLV transmission owing to weak BLV infection and low PVL.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging and highly attractive therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer due to their oncogenic functions and selective expression in cancer cells. However, lncRNAs have historically been considered 'undruggable' targets because they do not encode for a protein product. Here, we describe the development of a new siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle for the therapeutic silencing of the novel oncogenic lncRNA LINC01257. Transcriptomic analysis of children with AML identified LINC01257 as specifically expressed in t(8;21) AML and absent in healthy patients. Using NxGen microfluidic technology, we efficiently and reproducibly packaged anti-LINC01257 siRNA (LNP-si-LINC01257) into lipid nanoparticles based on the FDA-approved Patisiran (Onpattro((R))) formulation. LNP-si-LINC01257 size and zeta-potential were determined by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer Ultra. LNP-si-LINC01257 internalization and siRNA delivery were verified by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. lncRNA knockdown was determined by RT-qPCR and cell viability was characterized by flow cytometry-based apoptosis assay. LNP-siRNA production yielded a mean LNP size of ~65 nm with PDI </= 0.22 along with a >85% siRNA encapsulation rate.

Our previous study demonstrated that apatinib, an orally selective VEGFR-2 antagonist, is highly effective in T-ALL. Additionally, chidamide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has proven to be cytotoxic against T-ALL in preclinical and clinical settings. However, whether the therapeutic interaction of apatinib and chidamide in T-ALL remains unknown. In this study, apatinib and chidamide acted additively to decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis in T-ALL in vitro. Notably, compared with apatinib or chidamide alone, the combinational regimen was more efficient in abrogating the leukemia burden in the spleen and bone marrow of T-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, the additive antileukemia effect of apatinib and chidamide was associated with suppression of mitochondrial respiration and downregulation of the abundance levels of several rate-limiting enzymes that are involved in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In addition, apatinib enhanced the antileukemia effect of chidamide on T-ALL via activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway and impediment of mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together, the study provides a potential role for apatinib in combination with chidamide in the management of T-ALL and warrants further clinical evaluations of this combination in patients with T-ALL.",,"['Zhong, Mengya', 'Lin, Fusheng', 'Jiang, Yuelong', 'Pan, Guangchao', 'Tan, Jinshui', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Lai, Qian', 'Chen, Qinwei', 'Deng, Manman', 'Zha, Jie', 'Xu, Bing']","['Zhong M', 'Lin F', 'Jiang Y', 'Pan G', 'Tan J', 'Zhou H', 'Lai Q', 'Chen Q', 'Deng M', 'Zha J', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xiamen for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hematological Malignancy, No. 55, Shizhen Hai Road, Xiamen 361003, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210929,Switzerland,J Pers Med,Journal of personalized medicine,101602269,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)', 'apatinib', 'chidamide', 'citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)', 'mitochondria', 'oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)', 'synergy']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:14'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['jpm11100977 [pii]', '10.3390/jpm11100977 [doi]']",epublish,J Pers Med. 2021 Sep 29;11(10). pii: jpm11100977. doi: 10.3390/jpm11100977.,11,10,,,,PMC8540063,"['82170180, 81770126, 81800163, 81770161/National Natural Science Foundation of', 'China']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4282-7757'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce these global disparities in low-middle income countries (LMIC), a paradigm shift is needed: start with curing low-risk ALL. Low-risk ALL, which accounts for >50% of patients, can be cured with low-toxicity therapies already defined by collaborative studies. We reviewed the components of these low-toxicity regimens in recent clinical trials for low-risk ALL and suggest how they can be adopted in LMIC. In treating childhood ALL, the key is risk stratification, which can be resource stratified. NCI standard-risk criteria (age 1-10 years, WBC < 50,000/uL) is simple yet highly effective. Other favorable features such as ETV6-RUNX1, hyperdiploidy, early peripheral blood and bone marrow responses, and simplified flow MRD at the end of induction can be added depending on resources. With limited supportive care in LMIC, more critical than relapse is treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Less intensive induction allows early marrow recovery, reducing the need for intensive supportive care. Other key elements in low-toxicity protocol designs include: induction steroid type; high-dose versus low-dose escalating methotrexate; judicious use of anthracyclines; and steroid pulses during maintenance. In summary, the first effective step in curing ALL in LMIC is to focus on curing low-risk ALL with less intensive therapy and less toxicity.",,"['Oh, Bernice L Z', 'Lee, Shawn H R', 'Yeoh, Allen E J']","['Oh BLZ', 'Lee SHR', 'Yeoh AEJ']","[""VIVA-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo-Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore 119074, Singapore."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore, Singapore 119074, Singapore.', ""VIVA-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo-Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore 119074, Singapore."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore, Singapore 119074, Singapore.', ""VIVA-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo-Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore 119074, Singapore."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore, Singapore 119074, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211015,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'low-risk ALL', 'risk-stratified treatment', 'treatment related toxicity']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:13'],"['2021/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10204728 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10204728 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Oct 15;10(20). pii: jcm10204728. doi: 10.3390/jcm10204728.,10,20,,,,PMC8540602,"['NMRC/RTF/MOH/000616/National Medical Research Council', 'NMRC/CSA/MOH/000227/National Medical Research Council', 'NMRC/RTF/MOH/000302/National Medical Research Council']",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6184-8935'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insight into diagnostic intervals in young adults (YAs; aged 25-39) and subgroups at risk for long intervals is lacking. We investigated the diagnostic pathway of YA cancer patients, examined patient and tumor characteristics associated with its length, and compared the patient interval length of our sample with a TYA cohort. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey YAs diagnosed with cancer in the UK in the past five years completed a questionnaire describing their patient (time from first symptom to first doctor consultation) and healthcare interval (from first consultation until consultation with a cancer specialist), sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics. Associations between characteristics and interval length were examined and compared with previously published data in TYAs. RESULTS: Among 341 YAs the patient interval lasted >/=2 weeks, >/=1 month, and >/=3 months in 60%, 42%, and 21%, respectively, compared to 48%, 27%, and 12% in the TYA group. The healthcare interval lasted >/=2 weeks, >/=1 month, and >/=3 months in 62%, 40%, and 17% of YA patients, respectively. YAs with melanoma or cervical cancer were most likely to experience long intervals, whereas YAs with breast cancer and leukemia were most likely to experience short intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Most YAs were not seen by a cancer specialist within 2 weeks of GP consultation. Interval lengths in YAs were associated with cancer diagnosis. Patient intervals were longer among YAs than among TYAs. Our study highlights long diagnostic pathways among YAs and calls for more awareness among healthcare professionals about malignancies in this age group.",,"['Soomers, Victorien L M N', 'Lidington, Emma', 'Sirohi, Bhawna', 'Gonzalez, Michael A', 'Darlington, Anne-Sophie', 'van der Graaf, Winette T A', 'Husson, Olga']","['Soomers VLMN', 'Lidington E', 'Sirohi B', 'Gonzalez MA', 'Darlington AS', 'van der Graaf WTA', 'Husson O']","['Radboudumc, Department of Medical Oncology, 6525 GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London SW3 6JJ, UK.', 'Max Institute of Cancer Care, Max Healthcare, New Delhi 110024, India.', 'Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London SW7 2BX, UK.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London SW3 6JJ, UK.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Centre, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Institute of Cancer Research, London SM2 5NG, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211011,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,['NOTNLM'],"['diagnostic pathway', 'healthcare interval', 'patient interval', 'time to diagnosis']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:12'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:12 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10204646 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10204646 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Oct 11;10(20). pii: jcm10204646. doi: 10.3390/jcm10204646.,10,20,,,,PMC8540185,"['2015-7527/Dutch Cancer Society', '198.007/Dutch Research Council']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0019-3968', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6176-8054', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7549-3338', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1387-8686']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the IFD cases among the patients with haematological malignancies identified at the Medical Mycological Research Center, Chiba University, between 2013 and 2019. The most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukaemia (34.3%). Forty-six point one percent of IFD patients received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The major pathogens were Aspergillus, Candida, and Fusarium. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common Aspergillus species, and Candida fermentati and Fusarium petroliphilum were the most common Candida and Fusarium species, respectively, in this analysis. Furthermore, various cryptic species and non-albicans Candida were identified. The drug susceptibility of such relatively rare strains suggests that analysis of the causative fungi should provide valuable information for therapeutic options.

However, it remains unclear how these genetic changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) occur, and how they confer an expansion advantage to the clones carrying them. Recently, inflammatory processes and changes in cellular metabolism of HSPCs and the surrounding bone marrow microenvironment have been associated with an age-related dysfunction of HSPCs and the emergence of genetic aberrations related to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP).

Despite advances in the management of such malignancies and the progress of novel therapies, unmet medical needs still exist in AML because of several factors, including poor response to chemotherapy and high relapse rates. Ardisianone, a plant-derived natural component with an alkyl benzoquinone structure, induced apoptosis in leukemic HL-60 cells. The determination of dozens of apoptosis-related proteins showed that ardisianone upregulated death receptors and downregulated the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAPs). Western blotting showed that ardisianone induced a dramatic increase in tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) protein expression. Ardisianone also induced downstream signaling by activating caspase-8 and -3 and degradation in Bid, a caspase-8 substrate. Furthermore, ardisianone induced degradation in DNA fragmentation factor 45 kDa (DFF45), a subunit of inhibitors of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD). Q-VD-OPh (a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor) significantly diminished ardisianone-induced apoptosis, confirming the involvement of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, ardisianone induced pyroptosis. Using transmission electron microscopic examination and Western blot analysis, key markers including gasdermin D, high mobility group box1 (HMGB1), and caspase-1 and -5 were detected. Notably, ardisianone induced the differentiation of the remaining survival cells, which were characterized by an increase in the expression of CD11b and CD68, two markers of macrophages and monocytes. Wright-Giemsa staining also showed the differentiation of cells into monocyte and macrophage morphology. In conclusion, the data suggested that ardisianone induced the apoptosis and pyroptosis of leukemic cells through downregulation of IAPs and activation of caspase pathways that caused gasdermin D cleavage and DNA double-stranded breaks and ultimately led to programmed cell death. Ardisianone also induced the differentiation of leukemic cells into monocyte-like and macrophage-like cells. The data suggested the potential of ardisianone for further antileukemic development.",,"['Leu, Wohn-Jenn', 'Chang, Hsun-Shuo', 'Chen, Ih-Sheng', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa', 'Chan, She-Hung']","['Leu WJ', 'Chang HS', 'Chen IS', 'Guh JH', 'Chan SH']","['School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, No.33, Linsen S.

SF3B1 is frequently mutated in cancer and is the target of distinct families of splicing modulators (SMs). Among these, H3B-8800 is of particular interest, as it induces preferential lethality in cancer cells bearing the frequent and highly pathogenic K700E SF3B1 mutation. Despite the potential of H3B-8800 to treat myeloid leukemia and other cancer types hallmarked by SF3B1 mutations, the molecular mechanism underlying its preferential lethality towards spliceosome-mutant cancer cells remains elusive. Here, microsecond-long all-atom simulations addressed the binding/dissociation mechanism of H3B-8800 to wild type and K700E SF3B1-containing SF3b ((K700E)SB3b) complexes at the atomic level, unlocking that the K700E mutation little affects the thermodynamics and kinetic traits of H3B-8800 binding. This supports the hypothesis that the selectivity of H3B-8800 towards mutant cancer cells is unrelated to its preferential targeting of (K700E)SB3b.

Their mechanisms of spermatogenesis impairment and the decrease in male fertility are not yet clear. We showed that under acute myeloid leukemia (AML) conditions, alone and in combination with cytarabine (CYT), there was significant damage in the histology of seminiferous tubules, a significant increase in apoptotic cells of the seminiferous tubules, and a reduction in spermatogonial cells (SALL and PLZF) and in meiotic (CREM) and post-meiotic (ACROSIN) cells. In addition, we showed a significant impairment in sperm parameters and fertilization rates and offspring compared to control. Our results showed a significant decrease in the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) under AML conditions, but not under cytarabine treatment compared to control. In addition, our results showed a significant increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha in whole testis homogenates in all treatment groups compared to the control. Increase in IL-1 beta level was shown under AML conditions. We identified for the first time the expression of GCSF receptor (GCSFR) in sperm cells. We showed that GCSF injection in combination with AML and cytarabine (AML + CYT + GCSF) extended the survival of mice for a week (from 6.5 weeks to 7.5 weeks) compared to (AML + CYT). Injection of GCSF to all treated groups (post hoc), showed a significant impact on mice testis weight, improved testis histology, decreased apoptosis and increased expression of pre-meiotic, meiotic and post- meiotic markers, improved sperm parameters, fertility capacity and number of offspring compared to the controls (without GCSF). GCSF significantly improved the spermatogonial niche expressed by increased the expression levels of testicular GDNF, SCF and MCSF growth factors in AML-treated mice and (AML + CYT)-treated mice compared to those groups without GCSF. Furthermore, GCSF decreased the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12, but increased the expression of IL-10 in the interstitial compartment compared to the relevant groups without GCSF. Our results show for the first time the capacity of post injection of GCSF into AML- and CYT-treated mice to improve the cellular and biomolecular mechanisms that lead to improve/restore spermatogenesis and male fertility. Thus, post injection of GCSF may assist in the development of future therapeutic strategies to preserve/restore male fertility in cancer patients, specifically in AML patients under chemotherapy treatments.",,"['Michailov, Yulia', 'AbuMadighem, Ali', 'Lunenfeld, Eitan', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud']","['Michailov Y', 'AbuMadighem A', 'Lunenfeld E', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Huleihel M']","['The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'Barzilai University Medical Center, IVF Unit, Ashkelon 7830604, Israel.', 'The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), Dep OB/GYN, Soroka Medical Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'Soroka Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Beer-Sheva, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER), The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)', 'male infertility', 'sperm parameters', 'testis']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:09'],"['2021/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:09 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222011157 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222011157 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Oct 15;22(20). pii: ijms222011157. doi: 10.3390/ijms222011157.,22,20,,,,PMC8538347,"['1418/19/Israel Science Foundation', '1111/REPRODUCTION HUB, Faculty of Health Sciences']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3436-0146', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4246-9299']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viability of melittin-treated cells was related to changes in O2 consumption and in the respiratory control index (RCI) of mitochondria isolated from melittin-pretreated cells as well as of mitochondria first isolated from cells and then directly treated with melittin. It was shown that melittin is three times more cytotoxic to Jurkat cells than to HHL, but O2 consumption and RCI values of mitochondria from both cell types were equally affected by melittin when melittin was directly added to mitochondria. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of melittin's cytotoxicity to healthy and cancer cells, the effects of melittin on lipid-packing and on the dynamics in model plasma membranes of healthy and cancer cells, as well as of the inner mitochondrial membrane, were studied by EPR spin probes. The affinity of melittin binding to phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin, and binding sites of phospholipids on the surface of melittin were studied by (31)P-NMR, native PAGE and AutoDock modeling. It is suggested that the melittin-induced decline of mitochondrial bioenergetics contributes primarily to cell death; the higher cytotoxicity of melittin to cancer cells is attributed to its increased permeability through the plasma membrane.",,"['Gasanoff, Edward', 'Liu, Yipeng', 'Li, Feng', 'Hanlon, Paul', 'Garab, Gyozo']","['Gasanoff E', 'Liu Y', 'Li F', 'Hanlon P', 'Garab G']","['STEM Program, Science Department, Chaoyang KaiWen Academy, Beijing 100020, China.', 'Belozersky Institute for Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'STEM Program, Science Department, Chaoyang KaiWen Academy, Beijing 100020, China.', 'STEM Program, Science Department, Chaoyang KaiWen Academy, Beijing 100020, China.', 'STEM Program, Science Department, Chaoyang KaiWen Academy, Beijing 100020, China.', 'Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Ostrava, 710 00 Ostrava, Czech Republic.', 'Biological Research Center, Photosynthetic Membranes Group, Institute of Plant Biology, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['31P-NMR', 'AutoDock modeling', 'EPR', 'T cell leukemia', 'cytotoxicity', 'inner mitochondrial membranes', 'melittin', 'mitochondrial bioenergetics', 'native PAGE', 'respiratory control index']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:08'],"['2021/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222011122 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222011122 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Oct 15;22(20). pii: ijms222011122. doi: 10.3390/ijms222011122.,22,20,,,,PMC8538590,"['GM08012/National Institutes of Health', 'A start-up grant from the MSU/Lomonosov Moscow State University']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5097-3973'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it causes side effects, such as immunological reactions, and presents undesirable glutaminase activity. As an alternative, we have been studying asparaginase II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, coded by ASP3 gene, which was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant asparaginase (ASP) presented antileukemic activity and a glutaminase activity 100 times lower in comparison to its asparaginase activity. In this work, we describe the development of a delivery system for ASP via its covalent attachment to functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains in the outer surface of liposomes (ASP-enzymosomes). This new delivery system demonstrated antiproliferative activity against K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia) and Jurkat (acute lymphocytic leukemia) cell lines similar to that of ASP. The antiproliferative response of the ASP-enzymosomes against the Jurkat cells suggests equivalence to that of the free Escherichia coli commercial asparaginase (Aginasa((R))). Moreover, the ASP-enzymosomes were stable at 4 degrees C with no significant loss of activity within 4 days and retained 82% activity up to 37 days.

Myeloid-biased differentiation and loss of polarity are distinct features of aged HSCs, which generally exhibit enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a direct role for mitochondria in the degenerative process. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge of the mitochondrial mechanisms that contribute to age-related phenotypes in HSCs.

Since the fractionation of this interesting seed oil has many environmental, economic and biological benefits, two borage fractionation techniques after extraction with CO2 under supercritical conditions have been studied: precipitation in two cyclone separators and countercurrent extraction column. Both techniques have successfully collected free fatty acids in one fraction: (i) two separators set up in series obtained the highest concentration of free fatty acids in separator 2 at 90 bar/40 degrees C; (ii) when countercurrent extraction column was used, the acidity index of the raffinate stream was independent from the operating conditions (2.6 +/- 0.5%). Furthermore, the composition of the fatty acids, as well as their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities, were determined. The profile of the fatty acids obtained by either of these two methods remained unaltered, so that the crude oil exhibited improved antioxidant and cytotoxic properties. All the extracts obtained in the two cyclone separators at the same pressure/temperature conditions displayed high tumouricidal activity against HL 60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells, even if the extracts at 50% concentration from separator 2 presented a lower inhibitory activity (IC50).

Despite the availability of plant-based protein alternatives, animal meat remains a popular, high-quality protein source. Research studies have focused on cultured meat (meat grown in vitro) as a safe and more efficient alternative to traditional meat. Cultured meat is produced by in vitro myogenesis, which involves the processing of muscle satellite and mature muscle cells. Meat culture efficiency is largely determined by the culture conditions, such as the cell type and cell culture medium used and the biomolecular composition. Protein production can be enhanced by providing the optimum biochemical and physical conditions for skeletal muscle cell growth, while myoblasts play important roles in skeletal muscle formation and growth. This review describes the cell types used to produce cultured meat and the biological effects of various myokines and cytokines, such as interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-4, interleukin-15, and interleukin-1beta, on skeletal muscle and myogenesis and their potential roles in cultured meat production.",,"['Shaikh, Sibhghatulla', 'Lee, Eunju', 'Ahmad, Khurshid', 'Ahmad, Syed-Sayeed', 'Chun, Heejin', 'Lim, Jeongho', 'Lee, Yongho', 'Choi, Inho']","['Shaikh S', 'Lee E', 'Ahmad K', 'Ahmad SS', 'Chun H', 'Lim J', 'Lee Y', 'Choi I']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Daegu Catholic University, Gyeongsan 38430, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Cell Culture, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan 38541, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210929,Switzerland,Foods,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",101670569,,['NOTNLM'],"['culture medium', 'cultured meat', 'muscle satellite cell', 'myogenesis', 'myokines']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:07'],"['2021/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['foods10102318 [pii]', '10.3390/foods10102318 [doi]']",epublish,Foods. 2021 Sep 29;10(10). pii: foods10102318. doi: 10.3390/foods10102318.,10,10,,,,PMC8534705,"['2020R1A6A1A03044512/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'NRF-2021R1A2C2004177/National Research Foundation of Korea', '321026-05/National Research Foundation of Korea']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7489-2393', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2496-0463', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1095-8445', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2829-2768', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0375-8170']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It mostly affects children under five years of age and is the most common tumor to afflict pediatric patients. The expression of the human telomerase gene (hTERT) in patients with ALL has been studied as a biomarker and could become a new therapeutic target. We evaluate the role of hTERT gene expression in ALL pediatric patients, through quantitative real-time PCR technique, and the possible correlation between hTERT expression and clinical variables: gender, age, white blood cells (WBC), gene fusions, and immunophenotyping. The analysis between healthy controls and ALL patients (N = 244) was statistically significant (p < 0.001), demonstrating hTERT overexpression in these patients. In comparison with the usual set of clinical variables, the data were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), indicating that hTERT is equally overexpressed among patients regardless of gender, age, gene fusions, and immunophenotyping. Moreover, patients who presented a higher hTERT expression level had a significant (p < 0.0001) lower overall survival rate. In summary, hTERT expression emerges as an important molecular pathway in leukemogenesis regardless patient's clinical variables, thus, the data here presented pointed it as a valuable biomarker in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a promising target for new therapeutic and prognostic measures.",,"['Nogueira, Beatriz Maria Dias', 'da Costa Pantoja, Laudreisa', 'da Silva, Emerson Lucena', 'Mello Junior, Fernando Augusto Rodrigues', 'Teixeira, Eliel Barbosa', 'Wanderley, Alayde Vieira', 'da Silva Maues, Jersey Heitor', 'de Moraes Filho, Manoel Odorico', 'de Moraes, Maria Elisabete Amaral', 'Montenegro, Raquel Carvalho', 'Khayat, Andre Salim', 'Moreira-Nunes, Caroline Aquino']","['Nogueira BMD', 'da Costa Pantoja L', 'da Silva EL', 'Mello Junior FAR', 'Teixeira EB', 'Wanderley AV', 'da Silva Maues JH', 'de Moraes Filho MO', 'de Moraes MEA', 'Montenegro RC', 'Khayat AS', 'Moreira-Nunes CA']","['Department of Medicine, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza 60430-275, CE, Brazil.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Octavio Lobo Children's Hospital, Belem 60430-275, PA, Brazil."", 'Department of Medicine, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza 60430-275, CE, Brazil.', 'Molecular Biology Laboratory, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem 66063-240, PA, Brazil.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Oncology Research Center, Federal University of Para, Belem 66073-005, PA, Brazil.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Octavio Lobo Children's Hospital, Belem 60430-275, PA, Brazil."", 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas 13083-970, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza 60430-275, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza 60430-275, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza 60430-275, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Oncology Research Center, Federal University of Para, Belem 66073-005, PA, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza 60430-275, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Oncology Research Center, Federal University of Para, Belem 66073-005, PA, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211017,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*gene expression', '*molecular biomarker', '*telomerase']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:00,['2021/10/23 01:06'],"['2021/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['genes12101632 [pii]', '10.3390/genes12101632 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2021 Oct 17;12(10). pii: genes12101632. doi: 10.3390/genes12101632.,12,10,,,,PMC8535500,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5761-8413', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5102-1811', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5570-3158', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5845-3481']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These unfavorable outcomes emphasize the need for new strategies targeting drug-resistant cells. As IDH mutations are present in the preleukemic stem cells and systematically conserved at relapse, targeting IDH mutant cells could be essential to achieve a long-term remission in the IDH mutant AML subgroup. Here, using a panel of human AML cell lines and primary AML patient specimens harboring IDH mutations, we showed that the production of an oncometabolite (R)-2-HG by IDH mutant enzymes induces vitamin D receptor-related transcriptional changes, priming these AML cells to differentiate with pharmacological doses of ATRA and/or VD. This activation occurs in a CEBPalpha-dependent manner. Accordingly, our findings illuminate potent and cooperative effects of IDH mutations and the vitamin D receptor pathway on differentiation in AML, revealing a novel therapeutic approach easily

The development of safe and effective ligands for CD19 has become an important need for the development of targeted conventional and immunotherapies. In this regard, aptamers represent a very interesting class of molecules. Additionally referred to as 'chemical antibodies', they show many advantages as therapeutics, including low toxicity and immunogenicity. Here, we isolated a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer binding to the human CD19 glycoprotein. In order to develop an aptamer also useful as a carrier for secondary reagents, we adopted a cell-based SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment) protocol adapted to isolate aptamers able to internalise upon binding to their cell surface target. We describe a 2'-fluoro pyrimidine modified aptamer, named B85.T2, which specifically binds to CD19 and shows an exquisite stability in human serum. The aptamer showed an estimated dissociation constant (KD) of 49.9 +/- 13 nM on purified human recombinant CD19 (rhCD19) glycoprotein, a good binding activity on human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells expressing CD19, and also an effective and rapid cell internalisation, thus representing a promising molecule for CD19 targeting, as well as for the development of new B-cell malignancy-targeted therapies.",,"['Esposito, Carla L', 'Van Roosbroeck, Katrien', 'Santamaria, Gianluca', 'Rotoli, Deborah', 'Sandomenico, Annamaria', 'Wierda, William G', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Ruvo, Menotti', 'Calin, George A', 'de Franciscis, Vittorio', 'Catuogno, Silvia']","['Esposito CL', 'Van Roosbroeck K', 'Santamaria G', 'Rotoli D', 'Sandomenico A', 'Wierda WG', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Ruvo M', 'Calin GA', 'de Franciscis V', 'Catuogno S']","['IEOS-Istituto per l\'endocrinologia e l\'oncologia ""Gaetano Salvatore"", CNR, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Department of Regenerative Medicine in Cardiovascular Disease, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'IEOS-Istituto per l\'endocrinologia e l\'oncologia ""Gaetano Salvatore"", CNR, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biostrutture e Bioimmagini, CNR, 80134 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Istituto di Biostrutture e Bioimmagini, CNR, 80134 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'The RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNA Center, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'IRGB-Institute of Genetic & Biomedical Research-CNR, 20138 Milan, Italy.', 'IEOS-Istituto per l\'endocrinologia e l\'oncologia ""Gaetano Salvatore"", CNR, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'IRGB-Institute of Genetic & Biomedical Research-CNR, 20138 Milan, Italy.', 'IEOS-Istituto per l\'endocrinologia e l\'oncologia ""Gaetano Salvatore"", CNR, 80131 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cells', 'CD19', 'aptamer', 'cell-SELEX']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:03'],"['2021/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13205220 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13205220 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 18;13(20). pii: cancers13205220. doi: 10.3390/cancers13205220.,13,20,,,,PMC8533794,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9284-7492', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5255-3668', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5997-756X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1653-4205']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with a switch in histopathology and biology, generally with a transformation of the original CLL clone to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or less frequently to Hodgkin's variant of Richter transformation (HVRT). It occurs in 2-10% of CLL patients, with an incidence rate of 0.5-1% per year, and may develop in treatment-naive patients, although it is more common following therapy. In recent years, there has been a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RT that involves the inactivation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in 50-60% of cases and the activation of aberrations of NOTCH1 and MYC pathways in about 30% of cases. Compared to the preceding CLL, 80% of cases with DLBCL-RT and 30% of HVRT harbor the same IGHV-D-J rearrangements, indicating a clonal evolution of the disease, while the remaining cases represent de novo lymphomas that are clonally unrelated. Despite advances in understanding the molecular variations and the pathogenesis of the disease, there is still no significant improvement in patient outcomes. However, if no clinical trials were designed for patients with RT in the past, now there many studies for these patients that incorporate new drugs and novel combinations that are being explored.

Hence, ""treatment-free remission (TFR)"" has become a possible treatment goal of patients with CML-CP. Currently, four types of TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib) are used as the first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML-CP. However, the second-generation TKI (2GTKI), the treatment response of which is faster and deeper than that of imatinib, is not always recommended as the first-line treatment for CML-CP. Factors involved in TKI selection in the first-line treatment of CML-CP include not only patients' medical background, but also patients' choice regarding the desired treatment goal (survival or TFR?). Therefore, it is important that clinicians select an appropriate TKI to successfully achieve the desired treatment goal for each patient, while minimizing the development of adverse events. This review compares the pros and cons of using imatinib and 2GTKI for TKI selection as the first-line treatment for CML-CP, mainly considering treatment outcomes, medical history (i.e., desire for pregnancy, aging factor, and comorbidity), and cost.

Despite superior clinical response to lenalidomide in hematologic malignancies, relapse and resistance remains a problem in IMiD-based therapy. The last ten years have witnessed the discovery of novel molecular mechanism of IMiD-based anti-tumor therapy. IMiDs bind human cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Binding of CRBN with IMiDs leads to degradation of the Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3) and casein kinase 1 alpha. We have found that lenalidomide-mediated degradation of IKZF1 leads to activation of the G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68)/calcium/calpain pro-apoptotic pathway and inhibition of the regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1)/calcineurin pro-survival pathway in MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Calcineurin inhibitor Cyclosporin-A potentiates the anti-leukemia activity of lenalidomide in MDS/AML with or without del(5q). These findings broaden the therapeutic potential of IMiDs.

Classical therapeutic options range from intensive chemotherapy in fit patients, potentially followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), to hypomethylating agents or palliative care alone for unfit/frail ones. In the era of precision medicine, the treatment paradigm of AML is rapidly changing. On the one hand, a plethora of new targeted drugs with good tolerability profiles are becoming available, offering the possibility to achieve a prolonged remission to many patients not otherwise eligible for more intensive therapies. On the other hand, better tools to assess patients' fitness and improvements in the selection and management of those undergoing allo-HCT will hopefully reduce treatment-related mortality and complications. Importantly, a detailed genetic characterization of AML has become of paramount importance to choose the best therapeutic option in both intensively treated and unfit patients. Finally, improving supportive care and quality of life is of major importance in this age group, especially for the minority of patients that are still candidates for palliative care because of very poor clinical conditions or unwillingness to receive active treatments.

Acute ATL has a unique interaction with bone characterized by aggressive bone invasion, osteolytic metastasis, and hypercalcemia. We hypothesized that dual tumor and bone-targeted therapies would decrease tumor burden in bone, the incidence of metastasis, and ATL-associated osteolysis. Our goal was to evaluate dual targeting of both ATL bone tumors and the bone microenvironment using an anti-tumor HDACi (AR-42) and an osteoclast inhibitor (zoledronic acid, Zol), alone and in combination. Our results showed that AR-42, Zol, and AR-42/Zol significantly decreased the viability of multiple ATL cancer cell lines in vitro. Zol and AR-42/Zol decreased tumor growth in vivo. Zol +/- AR-42 significantly decreased ATL-associated bone resorption and promoted new bone formation.

Within the cascade, multiple isoforms of Ras and Raf each display differences in functionality, efficiency, and, critically, oncogenic potential. According to the NCI, over 30% of all human cancers are driven by Ras genes. This dysfunctional signaling is implicated in a wide variety of leukemias and solid tumors, both with and without viral etiology. Due to the strong evidence of Ras-Raf involvement in tumorigenesis, many have attempted to target the cascade to treat these malignancies. Decades of unsuccessful experimentation had deemed Ras undruggable, but recently, the approval of Sotorasib as the first ever KRas inhibitor represents a monumental breakthrough. This advancement is not without novel challenges. As a G12C mutant-specific drug, it also represents the issue of drug target specificity within Ras pathway; not only do many drugs only affect single mutational profiles, with few pan-inhibitor exceptions, tumor genetic heterogeneity may give rise to drug-resistant profiles. Furthermore, significant challenges in targeting downstream Raf, especially the BRaf isoform, lie in the paradoxical activation of wild-type BRaf by BRaf mutant inhibitors. This literature review will delineate the mechanisms of Ras signaling in the MAPK pathway and its possible oncogenic mutations, illustrate how specific mutations affect the pathogenesis of specific cancers, and compare available and in-development treatments targeting the Ras pathway.",,"['Dillon, Martha', 'Lopez, Antonio', 'Lin, Edward', 'Sales, Dominic', 'Perets, Ron', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Dillon M', 'Lopez A', 'Lin E', 'Sales D', 'Perets R', 'Jain P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211010,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'ERK', 'MEK', 'Ras signaling', 'leukemia', 'solid tumors', 'viral oncogenesis']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:03'],"['2021/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13205059 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13205059 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 10;13(20). pii: cancers13205059. doi: 10.3390/cancers13205059.,13,20,,,,PMC8534156,['R01 NS097147/National Institutes of Health'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2319-252X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7253-7910', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8057-7835']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present review, we provide a summary of genomic abnormalities in AML that have emerged as both markers of disease and therapeutic targets. We discuss the abnormalities of RARA, FLT3, BCL2, IDH1, and IDH2, their significance as therapeutic targets in AML, and how various mechanisms cause resistance to the currently FDA-approved inhibitors. We also discuss the limitations of current genomic approaches for producing a comprehensive picture of the activated signaling pathways at diagnosis or at relapse in AML patients, and how innovative technologies combining genomic and functional methods will improve the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in AML.

Approximately 70% of patients survive >5-years following diagnosis, however, for those that fail upfront therapies, survival is poor. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated in a range of cancers and are emerging as significant contributors to the leukaemogenesis of ALL. ROS modulate the function of signalling proteins through oxidation of cysteine residues, as well as promote genomic instability by damaging DNA, to promote chemotherapy resistance. Current therapeutic approaches exploit the pro-oxidant intracellular environment of malignant B and T lymphoblasts to cause irreversible DNA damage and cell death, however these strategies impact normal haematopoiesis and lead to long lasting side-effects. Therapies suppressing ROS production, especially those targeting ROS producing enzymes such as the NADPH oxidases (NOXs), are emerging alternatives to treat cancers and may be exploited to improve the ALL treatment. Here, we discuss the roles that ROS play in normal haematopoiesis and in ALL.

A balanced ratio of its two isoforms, GATA-1FL and GATA-1S, contributes to normal hematopoiesis, whereas aberrant expression of GATA-1S alters the differentiation/proliferation potential of hematopoietic precursors and represents a poor prognostic factor in myeloid leukemia. We previously reported that GATA-1S over-expression correlates with high levels of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit C (SDHC). Alternative splicing variants of the SDHC transcript are over-expressed in several tumors and act as potent dominant negative inhibitors of SDH activity. With this in mind, we investigated the levels of SDHC variants and the oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in myeloid leukemia K562 cells over-expressing GATA-1 isoforms. Over-expression of SDHC variants accompanied by decreased SDH complex II activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency was found associated only with GATA-1S. Given the tumor suppressor role of SDH and the effects of OXPHOS limitations in leukemogenesis, identification of a link between GATA-1S and impaired complex II activity unveils novel pro-leukemic mechanisms triggered by GATA-1S. Abnormal levels of GATA-1S and SDHC variants were also found in an acute myeloid leukemia patient, thus supporting in vitro results.

We have recently reported that curcumin and carnosic acid applied at non-cytotoxic concentrations synergistically cooperate to induce massive apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells, but not in normal hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, via sustained cytosolic calcium overload. Here, we show that the two polyphenols can also synergistically suppress the growth of DU145 and PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cell cultures. However, instead of cell killing, the combined treatment induced a marked inhibition of cell proliferation associated with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. This was preceded by transient elevation of cytosolic calcium levels and prolonged dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, without generating oxidative stress, and was associated with defective oxidative phosphorylation encompassing mitochondrial dysfunction. The above effects were concomitant with a significant downregulation of mRNA and protein expression of the oncogenic kinase SGK1, the mitochondria-hosted mTOR component. In addition, a moderate decrease in SGK1 phosphorylation at Ser422 was observed in polyphenol-treated cells. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin produced a similar reduction in SGK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of curcumin and carnosic acid at potentially bioavailable concentrations may effectively target different types of cancer cells by distinct modes of action. This and similar combinations merit further exploration as an anticancer modality.",,"['Ossikbayeva, Saniya', 'Khanin, Marina', 'Sharoni, Yoav', 'Trachtenberg, Aviram', 'Tuleukhanov, Sultan', 'Sensenig, Richard', 'Rom, Slava', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Orynbayeva, Zulfiya']","['Ossikbayeva S', 'Khanin M', 'Sharoni Y', 'Trachtenberg A', 'Tuleukhanov S', 'Sensenig R', 'Rom S', 'Danilenko M', 'Orynbayeva Z']","['Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.', 'Department of Biophysics and Biomedicine, Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty 050040, Kazakhstan.', ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva 8410501, Israel."", ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva 8410501, Israel."", ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva 8410501, Israel."", 'Department of Biophysics and Biomedicine, Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty 050040, Kazakhstan.', 'Department of Surgery, Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ 08103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva 8410501, Israel."", 'Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211011,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,['NOTNLM'],"['OxPhos', 'SGK1', 'carnosic acid', 'cell cycle', 'curcumin', 'prostate cancer']",2021/10/24 06:00,2021/10/24 06:01,['2021/10/23 01:01'],"['2021/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/23 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox10101591 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox10101591 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2021 Oct 11;10(10). pii: antiox10101591. doi: 10.3390/antiox10101591.,10,10,,,,PMC8533243,"['226/16/Israel Science Foundation', 'Endowment/Cornelius Beukenkamp']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1898-1666', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2030-1786', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1050-1955', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9466-6169', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7401-2165']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pseurotin D, a secondary metabolite of fungi, represents a group of bioactive natural products with a newly ascribed range of interesting biological activities. The purpose of this study was to bring new insights into the mechanism behind the effects of pseurotin D on MEC-1 cells as a representative CLL cell line, with a particular focus on selected signaling pathways important in the proliferation of cells and targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Our results showed that pseurotin D was able to significantly inhibit the proliferation of MEC-1 cells and arrested them in the G2/M cell cycle phase. In addition, pseurotin D was able to induce apoptosis. We found that all of these effects were associated with a change in mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed for the first time that pseurotin D suppresses MEC-1 cell proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death via induction of the collapse of the mitochondria respiratory chain and the ROS-related caspase pathway.

Here, we report on the expression pattern of the LINC00152 in normal B cells and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B cell clones. Higher LINC00152 levels were consistently observed in memory B cell populations when compared to naive B cells in the normal tissues analyzed [peripheral blood (PB), tonsils, and spleen]. In addition, independent stimulation via Immunoglobulins (IG), CD40, or Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) upregulated LINC00152 in PB B cells. The expression of LINC00152 in a cohort of 107 early stage Binet A CLL patients was highly variable and did not correlate with known prognostic markers or clinical evolution. TLR9 stimulation, but not CD40 or IG challenge, was able to upregulate LINC00152 expression in CLL cells. In addition, LINC00152 silencing in CLL cell lines expressing LINC00152 failed to induce significant cell survival or apoptosis changes. These data suggest that, in normal B cells, the expression of LINC00152 is regulated by immunomodulatory signals, which are only partially effective in CLL cells.

It plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer. Mutations in PIM1, especially in its kinase domain, can induce abnormal structural changes and thus alter functionalities that can lead to disease progression and other complexities. Herein, we have performed an extensive analysis of the PIM1 mutations at sequence and structure level while utilizing state-of-the-art computational approaches. Based on the impact on PIM1, numerous pathogenic and destabilizing mutations were identified and subsequently analyzed in detail. Finally, two amino acid substitutions (W109C and F147C) in the kinase domain of PIM1 were selected to explore their impact on the PIM1 structure in a time evolution manner using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 200 ns. MD results indicate significant conformational altercations in the structure of PIM1, especially upon F147C mutation. This study provides a significant insight into the PIM1 dysfunction upon single amino acid substitutions, which can be utilized to get insights into the molecular basis of PIM1-associated disease progression.",,"['Shafie, Alaa', 'Khan, Shama', 'Batra, Sagar', 'Anjum, Farah', 'Mohammad, Taj', 'Alam, Shoaib', 'Yadav, Dharmendra Kumar', 'Islam, Asimul', 'Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz']","['Shafie A', 'Khan S', 'Batra S', 'Anjum F', 'Mohammad T', 'Alam S', 'Yadav DK', 'Islam A', 'Hassan MI']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3D), University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Rajasthan, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi, India.', 'College of Pharmacy, Gachon University of Medicine and Science, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon City, South Korea.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211022,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/10/23 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/10/22 21:04'],"['2021/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/22 21:04 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0258929 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-30234 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Oct 22;16(10):e0258929. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0258929. eCollection 2021.,16,10,e0258929,20211203,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Genomics', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC8535467,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3986-5047', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8597-6015', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0399-4835', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1102-1993', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9060-7970', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3663-4940']",['EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epidemiological profile of the disease comprises a wide range of hosts, including dogs and cats. Despite several studies about feline Leishmaniosis, the role of cats in disease epidemiology and its clinical impact is still debated. The present study raises awareness about the impact of leishmaniasis in cats from an endemic region in of Northwestern Italy (Liguria). A total number of 250 serum and 282 blood samples were collected from cats, then assessed for Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) serologically using western blot (WB) and molecularly using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also tested the association of Leishmania infection with some infectious agents like haemotropic Mycoplasma, Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) together with the hematobiochemical status of the examined animals. Interestingly, all tested animals were asymptomatic and out of 250 examined serum samples, 33 (13.20%) samples (confidence interval (CI) 95% 9.56-17.96%) were positive at WB for L. infantum, whereas of the 282 blood samples, 80 (28.36%) returned a positive PCR (CI 95% 23.43-33.89%). Furthermore, there was a statistical association between PCR positivity for L. infantum and some hematological parameters besides FIV infection as well as a direct significant correlation between Mycoplasma infection and WB positivity. Taken together, the present findings report high prevalence of L. infantum among cats, which reinforces the significance of such positive asymptomatic animals and confirms the very low humoral response in this species. In addition, the laboratory values provide evidence that infection by the parasite is linked to alteration of some hematological parameters and is correlated to some infectious agents.

BD is classified as a known human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals treated with BD by inhalation and epidemiological studies revealing an increased risk of leukemia and lymphohematopoietic cancers in workers occupationally exposed to BD. Upon exposure via inhalation, BD is bioactivated to several toxic epoxides including 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EB), 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EBD), and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB); these are conjugated with glutathione and excreted as 2-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)-1-hydroxybut-3-ene/1-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)-2-hydr oxybut-3-ene (MHBMA), 4-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)-1,2-dihydroxybutane (DHBMA), and 1,4-bis-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)butane-2,3-diol (bis-BDMA). Exposure to DEB generates monoalkylated DNA adducts, DNA-DNA crosslinks, and DNA-protein crosslinks, which can cause base substitutions, genomic rearrangements, and large genomic deletions. In this study, we developed a quantitative nanoLC/NSI(+)-HRMS methodology for 1,4-bis-(gua-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol (bis-N7G-BD) adducts in urine (LOD: 0.1 fmol/mL urine, LOQ: 1.0 fmol/mL urine). This novel method was used to quantify bis-N7G-BD in urine of mice treated with 590 +/- 150 ppm BD for 2 weeks (6 h/day, 5 days/week). Bis-N7G-BD was detected in urine of male and female BD-exposed mice (574.6 +/- 206.0 and 571.1 +/- 163.4 pg/mg of creatinine, respectively). In addition, major urinary metabolites of BD, bis-BDMA, MHBMA and DHBMA, were measured in the same samples.

Recent studies identified ANP32A as a novel biomarker of unfavorable outcome of leukemia, which promoted leukemogenesis by increasing H3 acetylation and the expression of lipid metabolism genes. It is of great significance to investigate whether targeting ANP32A is a novel strategy for leukemia therapy. To target ANP32A, we identified a peptide that competed with ANP32A to bind to histone 3 (termed as H3-binding peptide, H3BP). Disrupting ANP32A and H3 interaction by the overexpression of H3BP-GFP fusion protein mimicked the effect of ANP32A knockdown, impaired H3 acetylation on multiple locus of target genes, reduced proliferation, and caused apoptosis in leukemia cells. Furthermore, a synthesized membrane-penetrating peptide TAT-H3BP effectively entered into leukemia cells and phenocopied such effect. In vivo, TAT-H3BP showed potent efficacy against leukemia: Intra-tumor injection of TAT-H3BP significantly reduced the volume of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and recipient mice engrafted with TAT-H3BP-pretreated 6133/MPL W515L cells exhibited ameliorated leukemia burden and prolonged survival. Noticeably, TAT-H3BP efficiently suppressed proliferation and colony-forming unit of human primary AML cells without affecting normal cord blood cells. Our findings demonstrate that intervening the physical interaction of ANP32A with H3 impairs the oncogenicity of ANP32A and may be a promising therapeutic strategy against AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

The aim of this work was to study the tumor-suppressive effects of 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) in human acute leukemia cell lines. In addition, we aimed to address the extent of these effects in relation to the inhibition of hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis. MAIN METHODS: HA levels were measured by an ELISA-like assay. Human acute leukemia cell lines were treated with 4MU, HA or their combination. Cell proliferation was assessed by the [(3)H]-Tdr uptake assay, metabolic activity by the XTT assay and cell death was determined by DAPI, AO/EB and AnnexinV-PE/7-AAD staining. Senescence induction was evaluated by SA-beta-Gal and C12FDG staining. Total and surface RHAMM expression levels were assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. KEY FINDINGS: 4MU reduced metabolic activity and inhibited cell proliferation in all leukemia cells, and these effects were explained by the induction of senescence or cell death depending on the cell line evaluated. Exogenous HA failed to prevent most of the tumor-suppressive effects observed. Results from this work suggest that the tumor-suppressive effects exerted by 4MU would be explained by HA-synthesis-independent mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings broaden the knowledge of 4MU as a potential treatment in acute leukemia. We report for the first time the existence of tumor-suppressive effects of 4MU on human acute leukemia cell lines that are independent of its role as HA-synthesis inhibitor.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We identified incident FL and CLL cases diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, NY. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between race/ethnicity and all-cause mortality among FL and CLL separately. RESULTS: Of the 201 FL patients, 39.3% were NHW, 19.4% non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and 41.3% Hispanic, with a similar distribution among CLL patients. After adjusting for International Prognostic Index factors, sex, and chemotherapy, Hispanics with FL had lower all-cause mortality compared to NHWs (HR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.08-0.63), similar to prior DLBCL findings. All-cause mortality did not differ between NHBs and NHWs for FL or by any race/ethnicity for CLL. CONCLUSION: In our diverse, urban population, we found that Hispanic diagnosed with FL had lower all-cause mortality compared to NHWs. We found no significant difference in all-cause mortality between Hispanics and NHWs diagnosed with CLL. Our study adds to the growing literature on racial and ethnic differences in survival among Hispanics with hematologic malignancies.","['(c) 2021.

We explored the role of the Wilms' tumor 1 helper peptide OCV-501 to prevent recurrence after remission. METHODS: This placebo-controlled phase 2 study was designed to evaluate accurately the efficacy and immunogenicity of OCV-501 in elderly AML patients. Elderly AML patients who achieved first CR were randomly allocated to receive either OCV-501 (N = 69) or placebo (N = 65) once a week for eight weeks and then every two weeks until week 104. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Nineteen (27.5%) patients in the OCV-501 group and 23 (35.4%) patients in the placebo group completed the study without relapse. The median DFS in the OCV-501 and placebo groups was 12.1 and 8.4 months, respectively (p = 0.7671, hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.933 [0.590, 1.477]). The major drug adverse reactions were injection-site reactions. Although treatment with OCV-501 did not prolong DFS for elderly AML patients, post hoc analysis found that immune responders to OCV-501 whose specific IgG was > 10,000 ng/mL (N = 16) and whose WT1-specific interferon-gamma response was > 10 pg/mL (N = 26) had significantly longer overall survival compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The placebo-controlled design of this study and quantitative immunological monitoring provides new insight into the relationship between peptide-induced immune responses and survival, suggesting future perspectives for cancer immunotherapy.","['(c) 2021.

The prevalence of this population ranges between 2 and 22 per 100,000 persons in Canada and varies by region. Until recently, fixed-duration fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) was the primary treatment option in Canada for this patient population. The ECOG1912 trial has since demonstrated that ibrutinib and rituximab therapy are as effective as fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) in this population. The ALLIANCE trial showed that rituximab added no incremental benefit to ibrutinib. Canadian payors and physicians adopted ibrutinib monotherapy as the CLL standard of care, even in the young, fit population, although frontline ibrutinib therapy is often reimbursed by provincial public drug plans only in patients with high-risk disease or those who are unfit to receive fludarabine. Young, fit patients with CLL and their physicians may now choose between continuous ibrutinib monotherapy and fixed-duration CIT with FCR. Factors affecting this choice include patient preference and the short- and long-term toxicity profiles of both regimens, and a risk-based algorithm is provided. As new continuous-therapy options enter the market, all treatment choices present benefits and risks that must be communicated to the patient.",,"['Costello, Jacqueline', 'Kang, Matthew', 'Banerji, Versha']","['Costello J', 'Kang M', 'Banerji V']","[""Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Eastern Health, St. John's, NL A1B 3V6, Canada."", 'Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.', 'Joseph Brant Hospital Oncology Clinic, Hamilton, ON L7S 0A2, Canada.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W2, Canada.', 'CancerCare Manitoba Research Institute, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0V9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210930,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*Canadian', '*algorithm', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*frontline treatment']",2021/10/23 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/10/22 12:17'],"['2021/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/22 12:17 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['curroncol28050326 [pii]', '10.3390/curroncol28050326 [doi]']",epublish,Curr Oncol. 2021 Sep 30;28(5):3825-3835. doi: 10.3390/curroncol28050326.,28,5,3825-3835,20211027,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Canada', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use']",PMC8534822,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7415-8818'],"['0 (Pyrazoles)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unclear how everyday time-varying contextual factors (eg, mood) affect their adherence, stalling the development of personalized mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Poor engagement is also a challenge across mHealth trials; an effective adherence intervention must be engaging to promote uptake. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to determine the temporal associations between daily contextual factors and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) adherence and explore the proximal impact of various engagement strategies on ecological momentary assessment survey completion. METHODS: At the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, AYAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma who are prescribed prolonged maintenance chemotherapy that includes daily oral 6-MP are eligible, along with their matched caregivers. Participants will use an ecological momentary assessment app called ADAPTS (Adherence Assessments and Personalized Timely Support)-a version of an open-source app that was modified for AYAs with cancer through a user-centered process-and complete surveys in bursts over 6 months. Theory-informed engagement strategies will be microrandomized to estimate the causal effects on proximal survey completion. RESULTS: With funding from the National Cancer Institute and institutional review board approval, of the proposed 30 AYA-caregiver dyads, 60% (18/30) have been enrolled; of the 18 enrolled, 15 (83%) have completed the study so far. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol represents an important first step toward prescreening tailoring variables and engagement components for a just-in-time adaptive intervention designed to promote both 6-MP adherence and mHealth engagement.

Although they are generated from common multipotent neural stem/precursor cells (NS/PCs), embryonic NS/PCs cannot generate all of the cell types at the beginning of brain development. NS/PCs first undergo extensive self-renewal to expand their pools, and then acquire the potential to produce neurons, followed by glial cells. Astrocytes are the most frequently found cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), and play important roles in brain development and functions. Although it has been shown that nuclear factor IA (Nfia) is a pivotal transcription factor for conferring gliogenic potential on neurogenic NS/PCs by sequestering DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) from astrocyte-specific genes, direct targets of Nfia that participate in astrocytic differentiation have yet to be completely identified. Here we show that SRY-box transcription factor 8 (Sox8) is a direct target gene of Nfia at the initiation of the gliogenic phase. We found that expression of Sox8 augmented leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced astrocytic differentiation, while Sox8 knockdown inhibited Nfia-enhanced astrocytic differentiation of NS/PCs. In contrast to Nfia, Sox8 did not induce DNA demethylation of an astrocyte-specific marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), but instead associated with LIF downstream transcription factor STAT3 through transcriptional coactivator p300, explaining how Sox8 expression further facilitated LIF-induced Gfap expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Sox8 is a crucial Nfia downstream transcription factor for the astrocytic differentiation of NS/PCs in the developing brain.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

This improvement not only boosts binding and internalization abilities, but also expands the recognition spectrum for different leukemia cells. Moreover, the stability of DTCA in serum can be significantly improved by an enzyme-promoted terminal ligation strategy. The chemical incorporation of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine into DTCA resulted in a pharmaceutically functional aptamer that exhibited excellent selectivity, as demonstrated by its high cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, but not to normal cells.

We used a dual screening approach, incorporating fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), to establish the frequency and long-term outcome of a representative cohort of specific subgroups of B-other-ALL recruited to the childhood ALL trial, UKALL2003. We focussed on abnormalities of known prognostic significance, including ABL-class fusions and ERG deletions, as a surrogate marker for DUX4-rearranged ALL. ABL-class fusions accounted for ~4% of B-other-ALL and were associated with high levels of minimal residual disease (MRD; 14/23 with MRD >5%) and a high relapse rate (55.7%) following treatment without tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), confirming the importance of prospective screening with a view to incorporating TKI into therapy. Patients with deletions of ERG (~10% of B-other-ALL) had a 10-year event-free-survival of 97.2%, validating previous reports of their excellent outcome. Rearrangements of ZNF384, MEF2D and NUTM1 were observed at low frequencies. Here, we estimate that approximately one third of B-other-ALL patients can be reliably classified into one of the known genetic subgroups using our dual screening method. This approach is rapid, accurate and readily incorporated into routine testing.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We analyzed data from 206 AML adult patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the 60-day mortality rate, aiming to find risk factors and to examine the role of anti-infection prophylaxis. The 60-day mortality rate was 26%, raising to 41% among those older than 60 years. Complete response was documented at the end of induction in 49%. The final survival model showed that age > 60 years (HR 3.2), Gram-negative colonization (HR 3), monocytic AML (HR 1.8), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 15 mg/dL (HR 10), and an adverse risk in the genetic stratification (HR 3) were associated with induction death. Multidrug-resistant bacteria colonization, thrombosis, and AKI were documented in 71%, 12%, and 66% of the cohort, respectively. Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis did not improve outcomes in this study. Our report corroborated the higher mortality during AML induction compared to real-world data from the USA and Europe. In line with other publications, age and cytogenetic stratification influenced early death in this cohort. Noticeably, Gram-negative colonization, monocytic AML, and CRP were also significant to early mortality.","['(c) 2021.

However, it is not effective in treating solid tumors such as colorectal cancer. We have previously reported that polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) exhibiting the characteristics of cancer stem cells can be generated by various inducers. In this study, ATO was used to induce the formation of PGCCs in LoVo and Hct116 colon cancer cell lines. The migration, invasion, and proliferation abilities of colon cancer cells with and without ATO treatment were assessed by wound-healing, transwell, and plate colony formation assays. The expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition-related proteins and erythroid differentiation-related proteins in colon cancer cells was further evaluated by western blot and immunocytochemical assays. LoVo and Hct116 cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector for green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), H2B-GFP, and H2B-mCherry to study PGCCs formation via cell fusion. WB and ICC assays were performed to assess the expression of cell fusion-related proteins. MG132, small interfering RNA-glial cell missing 1 (GCM1), and chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to study the role of GCM1/syncytin-1-mediated cell fusion. Clinically, the significance of cell fusion-related proteins and erythroid differentiation-related proteins expression in human colorectal cancer tissues was evaluated. Results of our study showed that ATO induced the formation of PGCCs, and the daughter cells derived from PGCCs gained a mesenchymal phenotype and exhibited strong migration, invasion, and proliferation abilities. PGCCs also produced embryonic hemoglobin-delta and -zeta with strong oxygen-binding ability and erythroid differentiation-related proteins after ATO treatment. In addition, cell fusion was observed during the formation of PGCCs, indicated by the presence of yellow fluorescence via the GCM1/syncytin-1 signaling pathway. Clinically, the expression of cell fusion-related and erythroid differentiation-related proteins gradually increased with the progression of human colorectal cancer tissues. In conclusion, ATO can promote tumor progression by inducing the formation of PGCCs via GCM1/syncytin-1-mediated cell fusion. PGCCs can produce daughter cells with high invasion and migration abilities and embryonic hemoglobin with strong oxygen binding ability, promoting survival of tumor cells in a hypoxic microenvironment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Zheng, Zhang, Yang, Fan, Fu, Fu, Niu, Yan and Zhang.']","['Li, Zugui', 'Zheng, Minying', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Yang, Xiaohui', 'Fan, Linlin', 'Fu, Fangmei', 'Fu, Junjie', 'Niu, Rui', 'Yan, Man', 'Zhang, Shiwu']","['Li Z', 'Zheng M', 'Zhang H', 'Yang X', 'Fan L', 'Fu F', 'Fu J', 'Niu R', 'Yan M', 'Zhang S']","['Department of Pathology, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.', 'Graduate School, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Nankai University School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Graduate School, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.', 'Graduate School, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.', 'Graduate School, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Graduate School, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Graduate School, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211005,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic trioxide', 'cell fusion', 'colon cancer', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'erythroid cell', 'polyploid tumor giant cells']",2021/10/23 06:00,2021/10/23 06:01,['2021/10/22 06:52'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/22 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.720814 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 5;11:720814. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.720814. eCollection 2021.,11,,720814,,,PMC8523995,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, high tumor burden limits clinical efficacy and increases the risk of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, which is associated with over-activation of the CAR-T cells. The hinge domain plays an important role in the function of CAR-T cells. We hypothesized that deletion of glycine, an amino acid with good flexibility, may reduce the flexibility of the hinge region, thereby mitigating CAR-T cell over-activation. This study involved generating a novel CAR by deletion of two consecutive glycine residues in the CD8 hinge domain of second-generation (2nd) CAR, thereafter named 2nd-GG CAR. The 2nd-GG CAR-T cells showed similar efficacy of CAR expression but lower hinge flexibility, and its protein affinity to CD19 protein was lower than that of 2nd CAR-T cells. Compared to the 2nd CAR-T cells, 2nd-GG CAR-T cells reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion without diminishing the specific cytotoxicity toward tumor cells in vitro. Furthermore, 2nd-GG CAR-T cells prolonged overall survival in an immunodeficient mouse model bearing NALM-6 when tumor burden was high. This study demonstrated that a lower-flexibility of CD8alpha hinge improved survival under high tumor burden and reduced proinflammatory cytokines in preclinical studies.

Methods: Plasma samples from 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, and 66 plasma samples from healthy individuals were collected. The level of plasma PKM2 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The clinical significance of PKM2 in acute leukemia was assessed by analyzing receiver operating characteristic and survival curves. Results: The plasma levels of PKM2 in AML or ALL patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals, respectively. PKM2 can be used as a potential diagnostic index with the AUC of 0.827 for AML and 0.837 for ALL. The level of plasma PKM2 in ALL patients with a BCR/ABL-positive genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with a BCR/ABL-negative genotype (p<0.05). The event-free survival and the overall survival of acute leukemia patients with higher PKM2 expression was worse than those with lower PKM2 expression. Conclusion: This study showed that higher levels of PKM2 was negatively correlated with the prognosis of acute leukemia. Therefore, PKM2 can be used as a potential index to assess the incidence and prognosis of acute leukemia.",['(c) 2021 Huang et al.'],"['Huang, Yunxiu', 'Chen, Lin-Mu', 'Xie, Jin-Ye', 'Han, Hui', 'Zhu, Bao-Fang', 'Wang, Luo-Jia', 'Wang, Wei-Jia']","['Huang Y', 'Chen LM', 'Xie JY', 'Han H', 'Zhu BF', 'Wang LJ', 'Wang WJ']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211013,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'pyruvate kinase M2']",2021/10/23 06:00,2021/10/23 06:01,['2021/10/22 06:46'],"['2021/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/22 06:46 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S331076 [doi]', '331076 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Oct 13;13:7851-7858. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S331076. eCollection 2021.,13,,7851-7858,,,PMC8520821,,"['The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been widely used as traditional medicine since it has shown to lower blood glucose, manage cholesterol levels and further aid in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Herein, we aim to evaluate the anticancer activity of methanolic fenugreek seed extract against several cancer cell lines. Methods: We sought to investigate the phytochemical classes present in multiple fenugreek seeds extracts using HPLC-DAD followed by LC/MS, predict and investigate anticancer activity using PASS online webserver, the CellTiter-Glo assay, evaluate ADME properties, and perform molecular docking for all bioactive compounds via Maestro software. Results: Multiple extracts exhibited distinct phytochemical classes that demonstrated different biological activities. Fenugreek methanolic extract contains flavonoid chemical class, which showed the highest anticancer activity against the HCT8 cell line of colorectal cancer (IC50 of 8.83 mug/mL), followed by KAIMRC1 breast cancer cell line (IC50 of 35.06 mug/mL), HL60 leukemia cell line (37.80 mug/mL), MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (38.51 mug/mL), and lastly, HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line with IC50 of 56.03 mug/mL. In contrast, the chloroform extract was inactive. The molecular docking study for all the bioactive compounds suggested that flavonoids F6 (-9.713 and -12.132), F7 (-10.166 and -12.411), and F11 (-10.084 and -13.516) possess the highest docking scores through SP and XP scores, respectively. Conclusion: The obtained results confirm that the bioactive compounds present in fenugreek seeds exhibit anticancer activity against several cancer cells that can mediate via tubulin polymerization inhibition. Although our study has evaluated the anticancer potential of Trigonella foenum-graecum as a promising natural source for new anticancer agents, fenugreek biological activity needs further research and investigations on their mechanism of action and toxicity profile.",['(c) 2021 Alghamdi et al.'],"['Alghamdi, Sahar Saleh', 'Suliman, Rasha Saad', 'Alsaeed, Amjad Sulaiman', 'Almutairi, Khlood Khaled', 'Aljammaz, Norah Abdulaziz', 'Altolayyan, Abdulelah', 'Ali, Rizwan', 'Alhallaj, Alshaimaa']","['Alghamdi SS', 'Suliman RS', 'Alsaeed AS', 'Almutairi KK', 'Aljammaz NA', 'Altolayyan A', 'Ali R', 'Alhallaj A']","['College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Research Core Facility and Platforms, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Research Core Facility and Platforms, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Research Core Facility and Platforms, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Research Core Facility and Platforms, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Research Core Facility and Platforms, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211005,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['QTOF-LC/Ms metabolites', 'computational pharmacokinetics ADME', 'fenugreek Trigonella foenum-graecum', 'tubulin inhibitors']",2021/10/23 06:00,2021/10/23 06:00,['2021/10/22 06:44'],"['2021/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/22 06:44 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S320793 [doi]', '320793 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2021 Oct 5;15:4195-4211. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S320793. eCollection 2021.,15,,4195-4211,,,PMC8502543,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest in this work.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2770-218X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6323-0781', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2475-0258']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 alterations are associated with adverse outcome in many malignancies; however, whilst common in paediatric B-NHL, their utility as a risk classifier is unknown. We evaluated the clinical significance of TP53 abnormalities (mutations, deletion and/or copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity) in a large UK paediatric B-NHL cohort and determined their impact on survival. TP53 abnormalities were present in 54.7% of cases and were independently associated with a significantly inferior survival compared to those without a TP53 abnormality (PFS 70.0% vs 100%, p < 0.001, OS 78.0% vs 100%, p = 0.002). Moreover, amongst patients clinically defined as high-risk (stage III with high LDH or stage IV), those without a TP53 abnormality have superior survival compared to those with TP53 abnormalities (PFS 100% vs 55.6%, p = 0.005, OS 100% vs 66.7%, p = 0.019). Biallelic TP53 abnormalities were either maintained from the presentation or acquired at progression in all paired diagnosis/progression Burkitt lymphoma cases. TP53 abnormalities thus define clinical risk groups within paediatric B-NHL and offer a novel molecular risk stratifier, allowing more personalised treatment protocols.",['(c) 2021.

Using a panel of 20 genes recurrently altered in acute myeloid leukemia, we demonstrate quantitation of various mutations including single base substitutions and indels down to 0.001% VAF at a single locus with less than 4 million sequencing reads, allowing sensitive MRD detection in patients during complete remission. In a pan-cancer panel and a melanoma hotspot panel, we detect mutations down to 0.1% VAF using only 1 million reads.

However, the large-scale production of functionally active Hahella chejuensis-derived prodigiosin by fermentation in a cost-effective manner has yet to be achieved. In the present study, we established carbon source-optimized medium conditions, as well as a procedure for producing prodigiosin by fermentation by culturing H. chejuensis using 10 L and 200 L bioreactors. Our results showed that prodigiosin productivity using 250 ml flasks was higher in the presence of glucose than other carbon sources, including mannose, sucrose, galactose, and fructose, and could be scaled up to 10 L and 200 L batches. Productivity in the glucose (2.5 g/l) culture while maintaining the medium at pH 6.89 during 10 days of cultivation in the 200 L bioreactor was measured and increased more than productivity in the basal culture medium in the absence of glucose. Prodigiosin production from 10 L and 200 L fermentation cultures of H. chejuensis was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses for more accurate identification. Finally, the anticancer activity of crude extracted prodigiosin against human cancerous leukemia THP-1 cells was evaluated and confirmed at various concentrations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the impact of a complex karyotype on CBF AML prognosis, we included 24 patients with a median age of 56.4 years (23.2-83.3) and a median number of abnormalities of 5 (4-13). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 110.4 months. Among patients with a primary clone, complete remission (CR) was reached in 66.7% of patients. 31.3% of patients experienced AML relapse with a median of 8.5 months. Median OS for transplanted patients was 80.7 versus 40.5 months for non-transplanted patients, excluding the 4 patients with early death. Among patients harboring AML with clonal evolution, CR was reached in 62.5% of patients. 50% of patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In these, median RFS was 19.3 versus 0 months in non-transplanted patients. Median OS seemed also longer in transplanted patients with 23.5 versus 2.95 months in non-transplanted. CONCLUSION: Use of new treatment and tailored strategy based on measurable residual disease monitoring may now improve these results. However, these data allow us to reconsider the good prognosis historically associated with CBF patients despite of karyotype and the place of ASCT in the strategy.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Our previous study demonstrated that miR-149-3p was down-regulated in chemoresistant acute leukemia cells. However, the biological function of miR-149-3p in AML needs to be further explored. METHODS: Herein, the expression of miR-149-3p was overexpressed/silenced in U-937 human AML cells via transfection with miR-149-3p agomir/antagomir. The effect of miR-149-3p on U-937-induced tumor growth was investigated using a xenograft nude mouse model. RESULTS: The results showed that miR-149-3p overexpression inhibited the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of U-937 cells. In addition, miR-149-3p suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition in U-937 cells, as demonstrated by the miR-149-3p agomir-induced increase in E-cadherin expression and decrease in vimentin expression. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-149-3p suppressed tumor progression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the findings revealed the association of miR-149-3p with the development of AML and suggest that miR-149-3p is a potential therapeutic candidate for AML.",,"['Tian, Yaoyao', 'Jiang, Yongfang', 'Dong, Xiushuai', 'Chang, Yuying', 'Chi, Jia', 'Chen, Xi']","['Tian Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Dong X', 'Chang Y', 'Chi J', 'Chen X']","[""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell survival', 'miR-149-3p']",2021/10/23 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/10/22 05:29'],"['2021/10/22 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1990502 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):840-847. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1990502.,26,1,840-847,20211117,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",,,,,"['0 (MIRN149 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN149 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential role of diclofenac in the management of CRS in five pediatric patients treated for relapsed/refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: In case of persistent fever with fever-free intervals shorter than 3 hours, diclofenac continuous infusion was initiated, at the starting dose of 0.5 mg/Kg/day, the lowest effective pediatric dose in our experience, possibly escalated up to 1 mg/Kg/day, as per institutional guidelines. RESULTS: CRS occurred at a median of 20 hours (range 8-27) after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Diclofenac was started at a median of 20 hours (range 13-33) after fever onset. A mean of 3.07 febrile peaks without diclofenac and 0.95 with diclofenac were reported (p = 0.02). Clinical benefit was achieved by hampering the progression of tachypnea and tachycardia. Despite fever control, CRS progressed in four of the five patients, and hypotension requiring vasopressors and fluid retention, as well as hypoxia, occurred. Vasopressors were followed by 1-2 doses of tocilizumab (one in patient 2 and two in patients 3, 4, and 5), plus steroids in patients 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: Based on a limited number of patients, diclofenac leads to better fever control, which translates into symptom relief and improvement of tachycardia, but could not prevent the progression of CRS.",,"['Napolitano, Sara', 'Ottaviano, Giorgio', 'Bettini, Laura', 'Russotto, Vincenzo', 'Bonanomi, Sonia', 'Rovelli, Attilio', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Rona, Roberto', 'Balduzzi, Adriana']","['Napolitano S', 'Ottaviano G', 'Bettini L', 'Russotto V', 'Bonanomi S', 'Rovelli A', 'Biondi A', 'Rona R', 'Balduzzi A']","['Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Pediatric Department, and Monza and Brianza Foundation for Children and their Mums, San Gerardo Hospital, Lombardia, Monza, Italy.', 'Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College of London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Tettamanti Laboratory, Monza and Brianza Foundation for Children and their Mums, Monza, Lombardia, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Intensive Care, University Hospital San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Pediatric Department, and Monza and Brianza Foundation for Children and their Mums, San Gerardo Hospital, Lombardia, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Pediatric Department, and Monza and Brianza Foundation for Children and their Mums, San Gerardo Hospital, Lombardia, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Pediatric Department, and Monza and Brianza Foundation for Children and their Mums, San Gerardo Hospital, Lombardia, Monza, Italy.', 'University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Intensive Care, University Hospital San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Pediatric Department, and Monza and Brianza Foundation for Children and their Mums, San Gerardo Hospital, Lombardia, Monza, Italy.', 'University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211021,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematology-oncology', 'molecular oncology', 'pediatric oncology']",2021/10/23 06:00,2021/10/23 06:00,['2021/10/22 05:27'],"['2021/10/22 05:27 [entrez]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/03008916211053382 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Tumori. 2021 Oct 21:3008916211053382. doi: 10.1177/03008916211053382.,,,3008916211053382,,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2145-7395', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3777-0394']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eight patients (mean age, 11.0 years; range, 0.8 to 20 years) with biopsy-confirmed testicular involvement of hematologic malignancy between January 2018 and December 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Multiparametric ultrasound examinations, including grayscale, color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS), and SWE, were performed. Stiffness was measured in the involved testicular area and contralateral normal parenchyma. If there was bilateral testicular involvement, the stiffness of the involved area and the adjacent normal echoic parenchyma was measured on one testis. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare stiffness values. RESULTS: On grayscale, the testicular lesions were noted as a solitary mass in one patient, multiple lesions in four patients, and diffuse involvement in three patients. On CDUS and SWE, all patients demonstrated increased vascularity, and the stiffness of the involved area was higher than the values of normal parenchyma (the involved area vs. normal parenchyma, 11.6 kPa [3.9-20.2 kPa] vs. 2.9 kPa [1.1-3.7 kPa], P=0.003). The ratio of stiffness between the involved area and normal parenchyma was 3.4, ranging from 1.9 to 5.1. One patient showed decreased stiffness on follow-up SWE after treatment (affected testis vs. normal testis: initial, 13.8 vs. 3.2 kPa; 1 year later, 2.2 vs. 2.4 kPa).

The resected specimen showed a 5-cm-sized, white-yellow and homogenous solid mass in the testicular parenchyma. Histologically, the central part of the tumor exhibited typical features of seminoma. The peripheral part of the tumor exhibited diffuse infiltration of small, monotonous lymphoid cells involving the tunica albuginea. The monotonous lymphoid cells were immunoreactive for CD20, CD79a, CD5, and CD23, and negative for CD3, CD10, and cyclin D1.

However, the risk of post-SCT relapse remains a matter of concern. We report the results of a novel individual treatment approach with Treo/Flu and cytarabine (Treo/Flu/AraC) conditioning prior to allogeneic SCT in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). METHODS: Seventy-seven patients (median age 54 years) at high risk of disease relapse due to unfavorable cytogenetics or failure to achieve complete remission prior to SCT were included. Median follow-up was 3.2 years. RESULTS: The 1-, 2- and 3-year RFS rates were 49.4%, 41.7%, and 37.6% and OS rates were 59.3%, 49.3%, and 45.4%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of NRM was 10% at 100 days, 18.8% at 1 year and 20.1% at 2 years. The cumulative incidence of relapse increased from 31% at 1 year to 38.5% after 3 years. The cumulative incidences of engraftment, chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and toxicities were acceptable and comparable with similar patients conditioned with Treo/Flu or FLAMSA-RIC. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Treo/Flu/AraC provides tolerable, feasible, and effective conditioning for patients with AML, MDS or MPN, even in advanced disease states. The incidence of NRM and relapse is acceptable in this heavily pre-treated population with high-risk disease. Future research will aim to confirm these initial findings and include a larger number of participants in a prospective trial.",['(c) 2021.

In rare instances, RARA is fused with other partners in variant APL. More infrequently, non-RARA genes are rearranged in AML patients resembling APL. However, the underlying disease pathogenesis in these atypical cases is largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a NUP98- JADE2 fusion in a pediatric AML patient showing APL-like morphology and immunophenotype. Mechanistically, we showed that NUP98-JADE2 could impair all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated transcriptional control and myeloid differentiation. Intriguingly, NUP98-JADE2 was found to alter the subcellular distribution of wild-type JADE2, whose down-regulation similarly led to attenuated ATRA-induced responses and myeloid activation, suggesting that NUP98-JADE2 may mediate JADE2 inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a NUP98-non-RAR rearrangement identified in an AML patient mimicking APL. Our findings suggest JADE2 as a novel myeloid player involved in retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Despite lacking a rearranged RARA, our findings implicate that altered retinoic acid signaling by JADE2 disruption may underlie the APL-like features in our case, corroborating the importance of this signaling in APL pathogenesis.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

The primary aim of this study was to estimate the cancer risk among individuals with ID compared to individuals without ID. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of all children live-born in Sweden between 1974 and 2013 and whose mothers were born in a Nordic country. All individuals were followed from birth until cancer diagnosis, emigration, death, or 31 December 2016 (up to age 43 years), whichever came first. Incident cancers were identified from the Swedish Cancer Register. We fitted Cox regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of cancer risk in relation to ID after adjusting for several potential confounders. We analyzed ID by severity, as well as idiopathic ID and syndromic ID separately. We performed a sibling comparison to investigate familial confounding. The study cohort included a total of 3,531,305 individuals, including 27,956 (0.8%) individuals diagnosed with ID. Compared with the reference group (individuals without ID and without a full sibling with ID), individuals with ID were in general more likely to be male. The median follow-up time was 8.9 and 23.0 years for individuals with ID and individuals without ID, respectively. A total of 188 cancer cases were identified among individuals with ID (incidence rate [IR], 62 per 1,000 person-years), and 24,960 among individuals in the reference group (IR, 31 per 1,000 person-years). A statistically significantly increased risk was observed for any cancer (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35-1.82; P < 0.001), as well as for several cancer types, including cancers of the esophagus (HR 28.4, 95% CI 6.2-130.6; P < 0.001), stomach (HR 6.1, 95% CI 1.5-24.9; P = 0.013), small intestine (HR 12.0, 95% CI 2.9-50.1; P < 0.001), colon (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.1; P = 0.045), pancreas (HR 6.0, 95% CI 1.5-24.8; P = 0.013), uterus (HR 11.7, 95% CI 1.5-90.7; P = 0.019), kidney (HR 4.4, 95% CI 2.0-9.8; P < 0.001), central nervous system (HR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.7; P < 0.001), and other or unspecified sites (HR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8-12.9; P = 0.002), as well as acute lymphoid leukemia (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4; P = 0.003) and acute myeloid leukemia (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.4; P = 0.004). Cancer risk was not modified by ID severity or sex but was higher for syndromic ID. The sibling comparison showed little support for familial confounding. The main study limitations were the limited statistical power for the analyses of specific cancer types, and the potential for underestimation of the studied associations (e.g., due to potential underdetection or delayed diagnosis of cancer among individuals with ID). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that individuals with ID showed an increased risk of any cancer, as well as of several specific cancer types. These findings suggest that extended surveillance and early intervention for cancer among individuals with ID are warranted.",,"['Liu, Qianwei', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Reichenberg, Abraham', 'Kolevzon, Alexander', 'Fang, Fang', 'Sandin, Sven']","['Liu Q', 'Adami HO', 'Reichenberg A', 'Kolevzon A', 'Fang F', 'Sandin S']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

The Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (Flanker) and Dimensional Change Card Sort were completed during the last cycle. RESULTS: During maintenance therapy, IL-8 decreased, and parent reports of children's cognitive function improved.

Several attempts have been made to treat non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by employing differentiation inducers, such as hypomethylating agents and low-dose cytarabine, with encouraging results. In the present review, I focus on other possible differentiation inducers: kinase inhibitors and interferons (IFNs). A number of kinase inhibitors have been reported to induce differentiation, including CDK inhibitors, GSK3 inhibitors, Akt inhibitors, p38 MAPK inhibitors, Src family kinase inhibitors, Syk inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and HSP90 inhibitors. Other powerful inducers are IFNs, which were reported to enhance differentiation with ATRA. Although clinical trials for these kinase modulators remain scarce, their mechanisms of action have been, at least partly, clarified. The Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway and the RARalpha downstream are affected by many of the kinase inhibitors and IFNs and seem to play a pivotal role for the induction of myeloid differentiation. Further clarification of the mechanisms, as well as the establishment of efficient combination therapies with the kinase inhibitors or IFNs, may lead to the development of effective therapeutic strategies for AML.","['(c) 2021 S.

We used this approach to prospectively examine mutations in the BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase from patients with newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib. Between May 2013 and November 2014, 50 patients from 18 institutions were enrolled in the study. We screened 103 somatic mutations and found that mutations in the P-loop domain were the most frequent (173/454 mutations in the P-loop) and noted the presence of the V299 L mutation (dasatinib-resistant/nilotinib-sensitive) in 98 % of patients (49/50). No patients had Y253H, E255 V, or F359 V/C/I mutations, which would recommend dasatinib rather than nilotinib treatment. The S417Y mutation was associated with lower achievement of a major molecular response (MMR) at 6 months, and the V371A mutation was associated with reduced MMR and MR(4.5) durations (MMR for 2 years: 100 % for no mutation vs. 75 % for mutation, P=0.039; MR(4.5) for 15 months: 94.1 % vs. 25 %, P=0.002). Patients with known nilotinib-resistant mutations had lower rates of MR(4.5) achievement. In conclusion, ultra-deep sequencing is a sensitive method for genetic-based treatment decisions. Based on the results of these mutational analyses, nilotinib treatment is a promising option for Korean patients with CML.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, some patients may require dose reductions to manage the occurrences of adverse events (AEs). Bosutinib efficacy and safety were evaluated following dose reductions in a phase I/II study of Ph+ patients with CP CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib or imatinib plus dasatinib and/or nilotinib, and those with accelerated-/blast-phase CML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia after at least imatinib treatment. In all, 570 patients with >/=4 years' follow-up were included in this analysis. Among 144 patients who dose-reduced to bosutinib 400mg/day (without reduction to 300mg/day), 22 (15 %) had complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) before and after reduction, 40 (28 %) initially achieved CCyR after reduction, and 4 (3 %) only had CCyR before reduction. Among 95 patients who dose-reduced to bosutinib 300mg/day, 23 (24 %) had CCyR before and after reduction, 13 (14 %) initially achieved CCyR after reduction, and 3 (3 %) only had CCyR before reduction. Results were similar to matched controls who remained on 500mg/day, indicating dose reductions had not substantially affected efficacy. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was lower after dose reductions, particularly for gastrointestinal events.

The management of AEs with bosutinib through dose reduction can lead to improved/maintained efficacy and better tolerability; still, approximately half of patients on treatment at year 4 maintained a dose of >/=500mg/day.

First-line treatments for CML consist of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that efficiently target BCR-ABL1 activity. However, drug resistance and intolerance are still therapeutic limitations in Ph+ cells. Therefore, the development of new anti-CML drugs that exhibit alternative mechanisms to overcome these limitations is a desirable goal. In this work, the antitumoral activity of JKST6, a naphthoquinone-pyrone hybrid, was assessed in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant human CML cells. Live-cell imaging analysis revealed JKST6 potent antiproliferative activity in 2D and 3D CML cultures. JKST6 provoked cell increase in the subG1 phase along with a reduction in the G0/G1 phase and altered the expression of key proteins involved in the control of mitosis and DNA damage. Rapid increases in Annexin V staining and activation/cleavage of caspases 8, 9 and 3 were observed after JKST6 treatment in CML cells. Of interest, JKST6 inhibited BCR-ABL1/STAT5 signaling through oncokinase downregulation that was preceded by rapid polyubiquitination. In addition, JKST6 caused a transient increase in JNK and AKT phosphorylation, whereas the phosphorylation of P38-MAPK and Src was reduced. Combinatory treatment unveiled synergistic effects between imatinib and JKST6. Notably, JKST6 maintained its antitumor efficacy in BCR-ABL1-T315I-positive cells and CML cells that overexpress BCR-ABL and even restored imatinib efficacy after a short exposure time. These findings, together with the observed low toxicity of JKST6, reveal a novel multikinase modulator that might overcome the limitations of BCR-ABL1 inhibitors in CML therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

T helper cells play a key role in regulating the immune balance in the body. In this study, benzene-induced hematopoietic toxicity BALB/c mice model was established, and changes in immune organs and T helper cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells) were explored. At 28 days after subcutaneous injection of 150 mg/kg benzene, mice showed pancytopenia and obvious pathological damage to the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. Flow cytometry revealed that the number of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the spleen increased significantly. The level of IL-10 in the spleen, serum, and bone marrow increased, while the levels of IL-17 in the spleen and serum decreased. Furthermore, the levels of CD4 and CD8 proteins in the spleen decreased. Immunofluorescence results showed that levels of Foxp3, a specific transcription factor that induced the differentiation of Treg cells, increased after exposure to benzene. Our results demonstrate that immunosuppression occurred in the benzene-induced hematopoietic toxicity model mice, and Treg cells and secreted IL-10 may play a key role in the process.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, results of CAR T cell projects in solid tumors have been less impressive to date, partly because of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). It is widely known that high adenosine production is an important factor causing tumor-induced immunosuppression in TME, and adenosine mediates the suppression of anti-tumor T cell responses via binding and signaling through adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR). Previous studies have shown that adenosine generated by cancer cells significantly inhibits T cell anti-tumor activity through binding and then activating adenosine 2A receptors (A2aRs) of T cells. Based on the previous work, in our study, we evaluated whether A2aR disruption by shRNA could enhance the anti-tumor function of anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR T cells both in vitro and in vivo. For this goal above, we used MSLN-positive human ovarian serous carcinoma cells (SKOV3) and human colon cancer cells (HCT116) as target cancer cells while MSLN-negative human ovarian cancer cells (ES2) as non-target cancer cells. We observed that targeting cell-intrinsic A2aR through shRNA overexpression caused significant A2aR disruption in CAR T cells and profoundly increased CAR T cell efficacy in both CAR T cell cytokine production and cytotoxicity towards MSLN-positive cancer cells in vitro. More importantly, in SKOV3 xenograft mouse models, anti-MSLN CAR-T cells significantly reduced the tumor burden compared with non-transduced T cells, and the anti-tumor activity of A2aR-disrupted anti-MSLN CAR-T cells was stronger than that of wild-type anti-MSLN CAR-T cells. Altogether, our study showed enhanced anti-tumor efficacy caused by shRNA-mediated A2aR disruption in anti-MSLN CAR T cells both in vitro and in vivo, which proved that shRNA-mediated modification of gene expression might be an excellent strategy for improving CAR T cell function in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and could potentially improve the outcome of treatment in clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the safety and activity of enasidenib plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in patients with newly diagnosed, mutant-IDH2 acute myeloid leukaemia ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1b/2 trial was done at 43 clinical sites in 12 countries (the USA, Germany, Canada, the UK, France, Spain, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, and South Korea). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had newly diagnosed, mutant-IDH2 acute myeloid leukaemia, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. In the phase 1b dose-finding portion, patients received oral enasidenib 100 mg/day or 200 mg/day in continuous 28-day cycles, plus subcutaneous azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) per day for 7 days of each cycle. In phase 2, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive web response system to enasidenib plus azacitidine or azacitidine-only, stratified by acute myeloid leukaemia subtype (de novo or secondary). The primary endpoint in the phase 2 portion was the overall response rate in the intention-to-treat population at a prespecified interim analysis (Aug 20, 2019) when all patients had at least 1 year of follow-up. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02677922, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 3, 2016, and Aug 2, 2018, 322 patients were screened and 107 patients with mutant-IDH2 acute myeloid leukaemia were enrolled. At data cutoff for the interim analysis, 24 patients (including two from the phase 1 portion) were still receiving their assigned treatment. Six patients were enrolled in the phase 1b dose-finding portion of the trial and received enasidenib 100 mg (n=3) or 200 mg (n=3) in combination with azacitidine. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred and the enasidenib 100 mg dose was selected for phase 2. In phase 2, 101 patients were randomly assigned to enasidenib plus azacitidine (n=68) or azacitidine only (n=33). Median age was 75 years (IQR 71-78). 50 (74%; 95% CI 61-84) patients in the enasidenib plus azacitidine combination group and 12 (36%; 20-55) patients in the azacitidine monotherapy group achieved an overall response (odds ratio 4.9 [95% CI 2.0-11.9]; p=0.0003). Common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with enasidenib plus azacitidine were thrombocytopenia (25 [37%] of 68 vs six [19%] of 32 in the azacitidine-only group), neutropenia (25 [37%] vs eight [25%]), anaemia (13 [19%] vs seven [22%]), and febrile neutropenia (11 [16%] vs five [16%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 29 (43%) patients in the combination group and 14 (44%) patients in the azacitidine-only group; serious treatment-related adverse events occurring in more than 5% of patients in either group were febrile neutropenia (nine [13%] in the combination group vs five [16%] in the azacitidine-only group), differentiation syndrome (seven [10%] vs none), and pneumonia (three [4%] vs two [6%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Combination enasidenib plus azacitidine was well tolerated and significantly improved overall response rates compared with azacitidine monotherapy, suggesting that this regimen can improve outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed, mutant-IDH2 acute myeloid leukaemia.

This study aims to explore the effect of long noncoding RNA H19 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis in neonatal rats with HIBD. The neonatal rat model of HIBD was established. The cerebral infarction volume and apoptosis index of cardiomyocyte increased, while H19 expression decreased in neonatal rats with HIBD. After the lentivirus vector of overexpressed H19 was injected into neonatal rats with HIBD, the cardiomyocyte apoptosis was suppressed; levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress injury of myocardial tissues were reduced. The binding relationships between H19 and miR-149-5p, and miR-149-5p and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were predicted by a bioinformatics website and verified using the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. H19 competitively bound to miR-149-5p to upregulate LIF expression and activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, a functional rescue experiment was carried out. Injection of Wortmannin reversed the inhibitory effect of H19 overexpression on cardiomyocyte apoptosis in neonatal rats with HIBD. It could be concluded that H19 competitively bound to miR-149-5p to upregulate LIF expression and activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis in neonatal rats with HIBD.

TTV demonstrates a wide sequence diversity and a large majority of humans are chronically infected by one or more types of TTV. As TTV is ubiquitous, and viral replication correlates with immune status, TTV has been studied as a marker to assess global functional immune competence in transplant recipients. Most studies of the prevalence, amounts, and variation in TTV have been performed using PCR assays. We here present a comparison of the most frequently used quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for TTV with shotgun metagenomic sequencing for detection and characterization of TTV in a cohort of pediatric cancer patients. The results show that TTV is more common than the qPCR assays indicate, and analysis of the TTV genome sequences indicate that a qPCR with primers and probe designed on a conserved region of the TTV genome may fail to detect some of the TTV strains found in this study.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

CD79a has been reported to exhibit a high degree of linage-specificity for B-cell differentiation, with a specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 100%. In this study, we investigated the efficiency and prognostic role of cytoplasmic CD79a (cCD79a) antibody-gated multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) in MRD detection in patients with B-ALL who received CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy bridging to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The retrospective analysis was carried on to 59 patients who accepted allo-HSCT after CD19-CAR-T infusion from June 2016 to May 2017. The MFC MRD statuses before and after allo-HSCT were both strongly correlated with the transplantation prognosis, the MFC panel with cCD79a gating can effectively monitor MRD after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and predict the prognosis after allo-HSCT.

This involves the stimulation of the immune system to control tumor growth and it specifically targets the neoplastic cells rather than the normal cells. Conventional chemotherapy has many limitations which include drug resistance, recurrence of cancer and severe adverse effects. Immunology has made major treatment breakthroughs for several cancers such as colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia etc. Currently, therapeutic strategies harnessing the immune system involve Checkpoint inhibitors, Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells), Monoclonal antibodies, Cancer vaccines, Cytokines, Radio-immunotherapy and Oncolytic virus therapy. The molecular characterization of several tumor antigens (TA) indicates that these TA can be utilized as promising candidates in cancer immunotherapy strategies. Here in this review, we highlight and summarize the different categories of emerging cancer immunotherapies along with the immunologically recognized tumor antigens involved in the tumor microenvironment.","['(c) 2021.

In this study, a series of 49 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline and 5-oxo-tetrahydrocyclopentapyridine analogs, containing different pyridine alkyl carboxylates at C3 and various aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic substitutions at the C4 position of the central core, were synthesized. The target compounds were tested for antiproliferative effect against three human cancer cell lines including MOLT-4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) by MTT assay, and the effect of the most potent derivatives on cell cycle was evaluated by RNase/propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometric assay. Generally, 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives (E series) possessed superior antiproliferative activities compared to their 5-oxo-tetrahydrocyclopentapyridine counterparts (F series). 5-Oxo-hexahydroquinoline compounds bearing 2-pyridyl propyl carboxylate (group D) and 3-pyridyl propyl carboxylate (group E) were better antiproliferative agents than those bearing other pyridyl alkyl carboxylates. Five best compounds with IC50 values in the range of 9.5-22.9 microM against MOLT-4 cells were selected for cell-cycle analysis, which revealed that derivatives D5, E3, and E5 with 2,3-dichlorophenyl, 3-nitrophenyl, and 2-nitrophenyl substitutions at C4 position, respectively, may induce apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. Molecular docking analysis, which was employed to make some predictions on the interaction of the most active derivatives with the binding site of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, suggested that the compounds may be well accommodated within the binding sites of these anti-apoptotic proteins via hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The findings of this study present 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives as antiproliferative agents with potential apoptosis-inducing ability in cancer cells.","['(c) 2021.

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all Code Blues at a large comprehensive cancer center. Demographic, clinical, and outcome variables were analyzed for patients with a hematologic malignancy who underwent CPR. Results: Of 258 patients, 60.1% had leukemia. Outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (70.2%), hospital survival (12%), and 90-day, 6-month, and 1-year survival rates of 9.8%, 8.2%, and 5.9%, respectively. Factors associated with hospital mortality included establishing a do not resuscitate order after CPR (p < .0001), location of CPR (p = .0004), cause of arrest (p = .0019), requiring vasopressors (p = .0130), mechanical ventilation (p = .0423), and acute renal failure post CPR (p = .0006). Although no difference in hospital survival between leukemia and non-leukemia patients was found, more non-leukemia patients were alive at 90 days (p = .0099), 6 months (p = .0023), and 1 year (p = .0119). Conclusions: Factors including organ dysfunction, location of CPR, and cause of arrest are associated with hospital mortality post CPR. However, immediate survival post CPR does not seem to be affected by a diagnosis of leukemia. These data should assist health care providers with discussions regarding advance care planning and goals of care after cardiac arrest.",['(c) 2021 Harborside.'],"['Warren, Mary Lou', 'Schneider, Virginia V', 'Qing, Yun', 'Feng, Lei', 'Campbell, Jeanne Y', 'Myers, Jason W', 'Von-Maszewski, Marian', 'Gutierrez, Cristina']","['Warren ML', 'Schneider VV', 'Qing Y', 'Feng L', 'Campbell JY', 'Myers JW', 'Von-Maszewski M', 'Gutierrez C']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210901,United States,J Adv Pract Oncol,Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology,101550346,,,,2021/10/22 06:00,2021/10/22 06:01,['2021/10/21 06:10'],"['2021/10/21 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.6004/jadpro.2021.12.7.4 [doi]', '2021.12.7.4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Adv Pract Oncol. 2021 Sep;12(7):705-714. doi: 10.6004/jadpro.2021.12.7.4.

The sensitivity of human acute leukemia cell lines to COH-203, and the mechanism underlying its anti-proliferative effects remain unknown, which was investigated in the present study. In the present study, it was demonstrated that COH-203 had notable time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative effects on the human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line. Furthermore, COH-203 treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner, and subsequently induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that upregulation of cyclin B was associated with G2/M arrest. In addition, treatment with COH-203 resulted in downregulated expression of Bcl-2.

However, even if the fully HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cells are used for transplantation, some patients still have poor prognosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), suggesting that the HLA system was not the only determinant of the outcomes of HSCT. In this study, we investigated whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the co-stimulatory genes within non-HLA regions were related to the outcomes of HSCT. The genomic DNAs of 163 patients who had acute leukemia and received HSCT and their respective donors were collected for analysis. Thirty-four SNPs located in the four co-stimulatory genes including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4), CD28, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily 4 (TNFSF4), and programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) were selected to explore their relationship with the adverse outcomes after transplantation, including mortality, cytomegalovirus infection, graft-versus-host disease, and relapse. Our results revealed that nine SNPs in the CTLA4 gene, five SNPs in the PDCD1 gene, two SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene, and four SNPs in the CD28 gene were significantly associated with the occurrence of adverse outcomes post-HSCT. These SNPs may play important roles in immune response to allografts post-HSCT and can be the targets for developing strategy to identify appropriate donors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chen, Chang, Wang, Lin, Hsu, Wang and Tseng.']","['Chen, Ding-Ping', 'Chang, Su-Wei', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Lin, Wei-Tzu', 'Hsu, Fang-Ping', 'Wang, Wei-Ting', 'Tseng, Ching-Ping']","['Chen DP', 'Chang SW', 'Wang PN', 'Lin WT', 'Hsu FP', 'Wang WT', 'Tseng CP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology and Laboratory Science, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Clinical Informatics and Medical Statistics Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology and Laboratory Science, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211004,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD28', '*CTLA4', '*PDCD1 (PD-1)', '*TNFSF4', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*non-HLA', '*single-nucleotide polymorphism']",2021/10/22 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/10/21 06:08'],"['2021/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/21 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.730507 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 4;12:730507. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.730507. eCollection 2021.,12,,730507,20211223,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD28 Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/*genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/genetics/immunology', 'Donor Selection', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'OX40 Ligand/*genetics/immunology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC8520956,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a tool capable of identifying clonal myeloid cells in the skin infiltrate and thus better characterize the link between hematological diseases and skin lesions. Objective: To assess whether skin lesions of MDS/CMML are clonally related to blood or bone marrow cells using NGS. Methods: Comparisons of blood or bone marrow and skin samples NGS findings from patients presenting with MDS/CMML and skin lesions in three French hospitals. Results: Among the 14 patients recruited, 12 patients (86%) had mutations in the skin lesions biopsied, 12 patients (86%) had a globally similar mutational profile between blood/bone marrow and skin, and 10 patients (71%) had mutations with a high variant allele frequency (>10%) found in the myeloid skin infiltrate. Mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, both in four patients, were the most frequent. Two patients harbored a UBA1 mutation on hematopoietic samples. Limitations: Limited number of patients and retrospective collection of the data. Blood and skin sampling were not performed at the exact same time point for two patients. Conclusion: Skin lesions in the setting of MDS/CMML are characterized by a clonal myeloid infiltrate in most cases.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Martin de Fremont, Hirsch, Gimenez de Mestral, Moguelet,',

However, for patients with low allelic ratio (AR) FLT3-ITD (FLT3-ITD(low), AR < 0.5), clinical features, as well as genomic and transcriptomic profiles remain unclear, and evidence supporting allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) remains controversial. This study aimed to elucidate the genomic features, prognosis, and transplantation outcome of FLT3-ITD(Iow) in AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. FLT3-ITD(low) was associated with a negative enrichment of the leukemic stem cell signature, a marked enrichment of the RAS pathway, and with higher frequencies of RAS pathway mutations, different from those with FLT3-ITD(high). Concurrent CEBPA double mutations were favorable prognostic factors, whereas MLL-PTD, and mutations in splicing factors were unfavorable prognostic factors in FLT3-ITD(low) patients. Patients with FLT3-ITD(low) had a shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than those with FLT3(wt). Allo-HSCT in CR1 was associated with a significantly longer OS and EFS compared with postremission chemotherapy in patients with FLT3-ITD(low). In conclusion, FLT3-ITD(low) is associated with different mutational and transcriptomic profiles compared with FLT3-ITD(high). The presence of concomitant poor-risk mutations exert negative prognostic impacts in patients with FLT3-ITD(low), who markedly benefit from allo-HSCT in CR1.","['(c) 2021.

By targeted next-generation sequencing, we identified 28 patients (20 men and 8 women) with pathogenic germline DDX41 variants who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in which only 3 (11%) had a family history (FH) of MNs. A subacute clinical course of cytopenia (mean duration of 11.2 months, range 0-72 months) prior to the initial AML diagnosis was accompanied by a low blast count (median at 30%, range 20-70%) in hypocellular marrows (93% of all patients), in vast contrast to the typical proliferative subtypes of AML in the elderly. Most patients had a normal karyotype (75%) and acquired a second DDX41 variant (69%). A favorable overall survival (OS) was observed in comparison to that of common subtypes of AML with wild-type DDX41 in age-matched patients. Our study demonstrated that the frequent germline pathogenic DDX41 variants characterized a clinically distinct AML entity. Features characteristic of DDX41-mutated AML include male predominance, often lack of FH, indolent course, low proliferative potential, frequent somatic DDX41 variants, and a favorable OS.","['(c) 2021.

After ENU mutagenesis, genetic lesions associated with failure of T cell development were identified by meiotic recombination mapping, positional cloning, and whole genome sequencing. Recessive genetic variants in 33 genes were identified and confirmed as causative by additional experiments. The mutations affected T cell development but did not perturb the development of an unrelated cell type, growth hormone-expressing somatotrophs, providing an important measure of cell-type specificity of the genetic variants. The structure of the genetic network encompassing the identified components was established by a subsequent genetic interaction analysis, which identified many instances of positive (alleviating) and negative (synthetic) genetic interactions. Several examples of synthetic lethality were subsequently phenocopied using combinations of small molecule inhibitors. These drugs not only interfered with normal T cell development, but also elicited remission in a model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Our findings illustrate how genetic interaction data obtained in the context of entire organisms can be exploited for targeted interference with specific cell types and their malignant derivatives.",['(c) 2021.

The FLT3-ITD allelic ratio has clear prognostic value. Nevertheless, there are numerous manuscripts with contradictory results regarding the prognostic relevance of the length and insertion site (IS) of the FLT3-ITD fragment. We aimed to assess the prognostic impact of these variables on the complete remission (CR) rates, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) of AML patients with FLT3-ITDmutations. We studied the FLT3-ITD length of 362 adult AML patients included in the PETHEMA AML registry. We tried to validate the thresholds of ITD length previously published (i.e., 39 bp and 70 bp) in intensively treated AML patients (n = 161). We also analyzed the mutational profile of 118 FLT3-ITD AML patients with an NGS panel of 39 genes and correlated mutational status with the length and IS of ITD. The AUC of the ROC curve of the ITD length for OS prediction was 0.504, and no differences were found when applying any of the thresholds for OS, RFS or CR rate. Only four out of 106 patients had ITD IS in the TKD1 domain. Our results, alongside previous publications, confirm that FLT3-ITD length lacks prognostic value and clinical applicability.",['(c) 2021.

High-throughput sequencing of the tumor exome makes it possible to investigate the subclonal tumor organization. Target panel, clinical exome, and complete exome sequencing data were compared in tumors with different mutational burden, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children and acral melanoma. Targeted sequencing of AML samples detected more than one potential driver mutation in the signaling pathway genes KIT, NRAS, KRAS, CBL, and FLT3 in one patient, reflecting the complex clonal structure of the tumor substrate. Clusters of mutant alleles corresponding to different populations of leukemic cells in a sample were isolated based on exome sequencing data from the same AML patients. A comparison of the mutation profile for a primary AML sample and samples obtained in remission and relapse made it possible to trace the dynamic changes in the clonal composition of the tumor. The subclonal tumor structure was investigated in an acral melanoma case as an example. Mutant alleles present in the sample with close frequencies were clustered using the SciClone and ClonEvol packages. The results were used to predict the intratumoral clonal composition and to assume a clonal evolution model, which described the changes in the clonal composition of the tumor during metastasis, including the appearance of new mutations that might be associated with further disease progression. The approach used in the work is suitable for identifying the mutations that cause the formation of new tumor clones, which may have a proliferative advantage, in particular, in conditions of antitumor therapy.",,"['Krasnov, G S', 'Ghukasyan, L G', 'Abramov, I S', 'Nasedkina, T V']","['Krasnov GS', 'Ghukasyan LG', 'Abramov IS', 'Nasedkina TV']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'nased@biochip.ru.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acral melanoma', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'high-throughput sequencing', 'somatic mutations', 'variant allele frequency']",2021/10/22 06:00,2021/10/22 06:00,['2021/10/21 05:45'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/21 05:45 [entrez]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31857/S0026898421050050 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2021 Sep-Oct;55(5):829-845. doi: 10.31857/S0026898421050050.,55,5,829-845,20211022,"['Child', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Melanoma/genetics', '*Skin Neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These germline pathogenic variants are hereditary and are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. There are two major lung cancer susceptibility syndromes, and both seem to be specifically associated with the adenocarcinoma subtype. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by variants in the TP53 tumour-suppressor gene. Carriers are mainly at risk of early-onset breast cancer, sarcoma, glioma, leukaemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma and lung cancer. EGFR variants, T790M in particular, cause the EGFR susceptibility syndrome. Risk seems limited to lung cancer. Emerging data suggest that variants in ATM, the breast and pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene, also increase lung adenocarcinoma risk. As for inherited lung disease, cancer risk is increased in SFTPA1 and SFTPA2 variant carriers independently of the underlying fibrosis. In this review, we provide criteria warranting the referral of a lung cancer patient to the cancer genetics clinic. Pathogenic variants are first identified in patients with cancer, and then in a subset of their relatives.

Here, we profiled the cancer cell m(6)A dynamics in the hypoxic tumor niche and its pathological consequences in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The m(6)A demethylase ALKBH5 was induced in GBM models under hypoxic conditions and was associated with a hypoxic gene signature in GBM patient samples. Depletion or inactivation of ALKBH5 in GBM cells significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and immunosuppression in allograft tumors. Expression and secretion of CXCL8/IL8 were significantly suppressed in ALKBH5-deficient tumors. However, ALKBH5 did not regulate CXCL8 m(6)A directly. Instead, hypoxia-induced ALKBH5 erased m(6)A deposition from the lncRNA NEAT1, stabilizing the transcript and facilitating NEAT1-mediated paraspeckle assembly, which led to relocation of the transcriptional repressor SFPQ from the CXCL8 promoter to paraspeckles and, ultimately, upregulation of CXCL8/IL8 expression. Accordingly, ectopic expression of CXCL8 in ALKBH5-deficient GBM cells partially restored TAM recruitment and tumor progression. Together, this study links hypoxia-induced epitranscriptomic changes to the emergence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment facilitating tumor evasion. SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxia induces tumor immune microenvironment remodeling through an ALKBH5-mediated epigenetic and epitranscriptomic mechanism, providing potential immunotherapeutic strategies for treating glioblastoma.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Dong, Feng', 'Qin, Xiaoyang', 'Wang, Baofeng', 'Li, Qian', 'Hu, Jinyang', 'Cheng, Xuan', 'Guo, Dongsheng', 'Cheng,

Methods Based on GEO and TCGA databases, the expression of miR-148b-3p in AML cells and its association with clinical prognosis of patients were analyzed with the bioinformatics software. The expression of miR-148b-3p in AML cells was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The miR-148b-3p mimic and the miR-148b-3p inhibitor were transiently transfected into AML cell lines THP-1 and NB4 by liposome-mediated transfection, respectively. The proliferation of leukemia cells was evaluated by CCK-8 assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling, and the protein levels of Bcl2, Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX), autophagy marker LC3, P62, and autophagy-related gene 14 (ATG14) were detected by Western blotting. The targeted binding of miR-148b-3p to ATG14 was measured by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and the effect of miR-148b-3p/ATG14 axis on the phenotype of AML cells was observed in the rescue experiments. Results A decreased expression of miR-148b-3p was found in leukemia blasts of AML patients, and the overall survival rate of AML patients with low expression of miR-148b-3p was significantly lower than that of the control group. Overexpression of miR-148b-3p inhibited THP-1 cells proliferation, promoted their apoptosis, downregulated the LC3II and ATG14 protein levels, and upregulated the P62 protein levels, while inhibiting the expression of miR-148b-3p in NB4 cells had the opposite effect. miR-148b-3p significantly reduced the luciferase activity of the wild-type ATG14 expression vector. The results of rescue experiments showed that overexpression of ATG14 reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-148b-3p upregulation on cell proliferation and autophagy, while inhibition of ATG14 expression weakened the promotive effect of miR-148b-3p downregulation on cell phenotype. Conclusion The miR-148b-3p inhibits the in vitro proliferation and autophagy of AML cells by targeting ATG14.",,"['Jiang, Xueke', 'Jing, Yipei', 'Lei, Li', 'Peng, Meixi', 'Xiao, Qiaoling', 'Ren, Jun', 'Tao, Yonghong', 'Huang, Junpeng', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Jiang X', 'Jing Y', 'Lei L', 'Peng M', 'Xiao Q', 'Ren J', 'Tao Y', 'Huang J', 'Zhang L']","['Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China. *Corresponding author, E-mail: lingzhang@cqmu.edu.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,IM,,,2021/10/22 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/10/21 05:37'],"['2021/10/21 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct;37(10):881-890.,37,10,881-890,20211022,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,"['0 (ATG14 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (MIRN148 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurolymphomatosis is a rare condition of neoplastic endoneurial invasion, which is primary or secondary to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. We describe a case of primary peripheral neurolymphomatosis of multifocal involvement in a 77-year-old male patient. He presented with left lower limb pain and was diagnosed with CD20+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT), and nerve biopsy contributed to the diagnosis. Genomic profiling, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were also assessed. CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletions have been identified. PD-L1 expression assessed by 28-8 antibody was 1% positivity, and TMB of the sample was 11.6 muts/Mb. The patient responded well to rituximab combined with chemotherapy, however, he died after 3 cycles of chemotherapy due to severe lung infection and subsequent complication of respiratory failure.

Recent studies have detected pervasive aberrant splicing in cancer cells, supporting its targeting for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we evaluated the expression of several spliceosome machinery components in multiple myeloma (MM) cells and the impact of splicing modulation on tumor cell growth and viability. A comprehensive gene expression analysis confirmed the reported deregulation of spliceosome machinery components in MM cells, compared to normal plasma cells (PCs) from healthy donors, with its pharmacological and genetic modulation resulting in impaired growth and survival of MM cell lines and patient-derived malignant PCs. Consistent with this, transcriptomic analysis revealed deregulation of BCL2 family members, including decrease of antiapoptotic long form of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) expression, as crucial for ""priming"" MM cells for Venetoclax activity in vitro and in vivo, irrespective of t(11;14) status.

While T-ALL accounts for only 15% of childhood and 25% of adult ALL, 30% of patients relapse with a poor outcome. Targeted therapy of resistant and high-risk pediatric T-ALLs is therefore urgently needed, together with precision medicine tools allowing the testing of efficacy in patient samples. Furthermore, leukemic cell heterogeneity requires drug response assessment at the single-cell level. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry to study signal transduction pathways such as the JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MEK-ERK pathways in 16 diagnostic and 5 relapsed TALL primary samples and investigated the in vitro response of cells to Interleukin-7 (IL-7) and the inhibitor BEZ-235. T-ALL cells showed upregulated activity of the PI3K-AKTmTOR and MEK-ERK pathways and increased proliferation and translation markers. We found that perturbation induced by the ex vivo administration of either IL-7 or BEZ-235 reveals a high degree of exclusivity with respect to the phospho-protein responsiveness to these agents. Notably, these response signatures were maintained from diagnosis to relapse in individual patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated the power of mass cytometry single-cell profiling of signal transduction pathways in T-ALL. Taking advantage of this advanced approach, we were able to identify distinct clusters with different responsiveness to IL-7 and BEZ-235 that can persist at relapse. Collectively our observations can contribute to a better understanding of the complex signaling network governing T-ALL behavior and its correlation with influence on the response to therapy.",,"['Kuzilkova, Daniela', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Rejlova, Katerina', 'Schulz, Axel R', 'Mei, Henrik E', 'Paganin, Maddalena', 'Biffi, Alessandra', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe']","['Kuzilkova D', 'Bugarin C', 'Rejlova K', 'Schulz AR', 'Mei HE', 'Paganin M', 'Biffi A', 'Biondi A', 'Kalina T', 'Gaipa G']","['Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Fondazione Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita degli Studi Milano Bicocca, Monza (MB), Italy.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.', 'German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin (DRFZ), a Leibniz Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin (DRFZ), a Leibniz Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Division, Women and Child Health Department, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Division, Women and Child Health Department, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Fondazione Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita degli Studi Milano Bicocca, Monza (MB), Italy. andrea.biondi@unimib.it.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Fondazione Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita degli Studi Milano Bicocca, Monza (MB), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211021,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2021/10/22 06:00,2021/10/22 06:00,['2021/10/21 03:28'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/21 03:28 [entrez]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.278796 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Oct 21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.278796.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The cohort consists of full-time employees with at least one day of service during 1979 through 2010. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for 111 possible causes of death studied. RESULTS: SMRs for malignant mesothelioma and asbestosis were highest for the 1940's decade of hire. Increased SMRs were observed for malignant melanoma and motor neuron disease with no obvious work patterns. Decreasing mortality patterns were observed for aplastic anemia and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality surveillance of this large established cohort aids in assessing the chronic health status of the workforce.

Although it is used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and incorporated into many hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning regimens, few studies have evaluated the pharmacology of alemtuzumab in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We therefore examined the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of alemtuzumab in adults with SCD who received a matched related donor HSCT to determine if the clearance of alemtuzumab affects transplant outcomes. DESIGN: PK and PD analysis of patient data from a single-center clinical trial. SETTING: Clinical research center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two adult patients with SCD who received one of two nonmyeloablative allogeneic HSCT regimens: alemtuzumab and total body irradiation (Alem-TBI) or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, and total body irradiation (Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alemtuzumab serum concentrations, absolute lymphocyte counts, T-cell (CD3), and myeloid (CD14/15) chimerism were collected at distinct time points and analyzed. A semi-mechanistic PK population model was built to understand inter-individual differences in pharmacology. Alemtuzumab was detectable up to 28 days post-HSCT. The mean alemtuzumab level 7 days after transplant for patients on Alem-TBI was 818 ng/ml, significantly lower than the mean level of 1502 ng/ml for patients on Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI (p < 0.001), but this difference decreased as time progressed. The clearance of alemtuzumab was linear, and the half-life was longer in the Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 61.1 h) compared to the Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 44.1 h) (p < 0.001). The CD3 chimerism at 2 and 4 months after transplant positively correlated with alemtuzumab levels collected on day 14 after transplant (R(2) = 0.40 and p = 0.004 at 2 months, R(2) = 0.36 and p = 0.005 at 4 months), but this significance was lost by 6 months after HSCT. No correlation was seen between alemtuzumab levels and CD14/15 chimerism. CONCLUSION: Between 2 and 4 months after transplant, higher alemtuzumab levels measured 14 days after transplant correlated with patients having better engraftment, suggesting more lymphodepletion may be needed to reduce graft failure in these two non-myeloablative matched related donor HSCT regimens.","['(c) 2021 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Furstenau, Dana', 'Peer, Cody J', 'Hughes, Thomas E', 'Uchida, Naoya', 'Tisdale, John', 'Hall, Oliver Morgan', 'Figg, William D', 'Hsieh, Matthew']","['Furstenau D', 'Peer CJ', 'Hughes TE', 'Uchida N', 'Tisdale J', 'Hall OM', 'Figg WD', 'Hsieh M']","['Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Clinical Center Pharmacy Department, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211117,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['alemtuzumab', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'sickle cell disease']",2021/10/21 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/10/20 17:32'],"['2021/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/20 17:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.2641 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2022 Jan;42(1):14-22. doi: 10.1002/phar.2641.

After these quality researches, this report laid emphasis on preclinical pharmacology and toxicology evaluation. Mab-TH was characterized in biological, pharmacological, and toxicological properties in comparison with the original drug, alemtuzumab. Binding activity and immune-dependent toxicity as in vitro activity were evaluated. Severe immunodeficient mice transplanted with a human leukemia cell line were also used as an in vivo pharmacological model and a 4-week repeated dosing study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the safety differences. Our results demonstrated that Mab-TH, the anti-CD52 antibody generated by a perfusion process, had high similarity in in vitro and in vivo activities compared with alemtuzumab in relevant preclinical models.

However, the underlying mechanism of selenium deficiency impairs placental function remains unclear. In this study, female mice were separately supplemented with a Se-deficient (0.02 mg/kg Se) or control diet (0.2 mg/kg Se) for 12 weeks before mating and throughout gestation. Maternal liver and placentas were collected at embryonic day 15.5 and analyzed for Se content. Oxidative stress status, proliferation capability, autophagy, and apoptosis of the placenta were determined. We found that maternal selenium deficiency decreased placental Se concentration and some antioxidant selenoproteins expressions. The concentrations of catalase and glutathione in selenium-deficient placentas were reduced, along with an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. Selenium deficiency inhibited the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Autophagosomes, autophagolysosomes, and upregulation of autophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha II (LC3B), Beclin1, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and Parkin were found in the selenium-deficient trophoblasts. Autophagic substrate p62/sequestosome 1 was surprisingly increased, indicating autophagy flux dysfunction. Selenium deficiency increased expressions of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase-9/-3, and decreased the B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) level. Moreover, typical apoptotic ultrastructure and apoptosis-positive cells were observed in the selenium-deficient placenta. Our results suggested that maternal selenium deficiency impaired placental proliferation, induced autophagy dysfunction and apoptosis via increasing oxidative stress, and the Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway involved in this process. This study revealed a novel mechanism by which maternal selenium deficiency caused impairment of the placenta.",['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Then, the level of 25(OH) vitamin D and the expression of VDR and four VDR-related lncRNAs were assessed. RESULTS: No significant difference in serum 25(OH) vitamin D was observed between patients with ALL (20.42+/-6.5 ng/mL) and healthy subjects (25.45+/-11 ng/mL). In addition, the expression of MALAT-1, HOTAIR, and P-21 was not statistically significant between the two groups. However, a significant reduction in VDR and H19 expression was observed in patients with ALL (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 25(OH) vitamin D insufficiency was evident in both groups.

Therefore, the current descriptive and cross-sectional study sought to determine the cytogenetic analysis of frequent hematological malignancies in Pakistan. A total of 202 peripheral bone marrow or blood samples from patients with benign and malignant hematological malignancy were taken using a conventional G-banding technique.

To determine the impact of VD3 status on systemic exposure and efficacy of these chemotherapeutic agents, we used VD3 sufficient and deficient mice and performed pharmacokinetic and anti-leukemic efficacy studies. Female C57BL/6J and hCYP3A4 transgenic VD3 deficient mice had significantly lower duodenal (but not hepatic) mouse Cyp3a11 and hCYP3A4 expression compared to VD3 sufficient mice, while duodenal expression of Mdr1a, Bcrp and Mrp4 were significantly higher in deficient mice. When the effect of VD3 status on DEX systemic exposure was compared following a discontinuous oral DEX regimen, similar to that used to treat pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, male VD3 deficient mice had significantly higher mean plasma DEX levels (31.7 nM) compared to sufficient mice (12.43 nM) at days 3.5 but not at any later timepoints. Following a single oral gavage of DEX, there was a statistically, but not practically, significant decrease in DEX systemic exposure in VD3 deficient vs. sufficient mice. While VD3 status had no effect on oral dasatinib's area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve, VD3 deficient male mice had significantly higher dasatinib plasma levels at t = 0.25 hr. Dexamethasone was unable to reverse the poorer survival of VD3 sufficient vs. deficient mice to BCR-ABL leukemia. In conclusion, although VD3 levels significantly altered intestinal mouse Cyp3a in female mice, DEX plasma exposure was only transiently different for orally administered DEX and dasatinib in male mice. Likewise, the small effect size of VD3 deficiency on single oral dose DEX clearance suggests that the clinical significance of VD3 levels on DEX systemic exposure are likely to be limited.",,"['Annu, Kavya', 'Yasuda, Kazuto', 'Caufield, William V', 'Freeman, Burgess B 3rd', 'Schuetz, Erin G']","['Annu K', 'Yasuda K', 'Caufield WV', 'Freeman BB 3rd', 'Schuetz EG']","[""Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", 'Integrated Biomedical Sciences, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.', ""Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Shared Resource, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Shared Resource, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211020,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/10/21 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/10/20 17:25'],"['2021/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/20 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0258579 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-39835 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Oct 20;16(10):e0258579. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0258579. eCollection 2021.,16,10,e0258579,20211124,"['Animals', '*Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Vitamin D']",PMC8528301,['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7312-2947', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3725-3648', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9783-0099']","['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear power plant (NPP) workers comprise nearly 15 percent of the MPS. Leukemia, selected cancers, Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and other causes of death are evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Radiation Exposure Information and Reporting System (REIRS) and the Landauer, Inc. dosimetry databases identified 135,193 NPP workers first monitored 1957-1984. Annual personal dose equivalents [Hp(10)] were available for each worker. Radiation records from all places of employment were sought. Vital status was determined through 2011. Mean absorbed doses to red bone marrow (RBM), esophagus, lung, colon, brain and heart were estimated by adjusting the recorded Hp(10) for each worker by scaling factors, accounting for exposure geometry and energy of the incident gamma radiation. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Radiation risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Nearly 50% of workers were employed for more than 20 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 30.2 y. Overall, 29,124 total deaths occurred, 296 from leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 3382 from lung cancer, 140 from Parkinson's disease and 5410 from IHD. The mean dose to RBM was 37.9 mGy (maximum 1.0 Gy; percent >100 mGy was 9.2%), 43.2 mGy to lung, 43.7 mGy to colon, 33.2 mGy to brain, and 43.9 mGy to heart. The SMRs (95% CI) were 1.06 (0.94; 1.19) for leukemia other than CLL, 1.10 (1.07; 1.14) for lung cancer, 0.90 (0.76; 1.06) for Parkinson's disease, and 0.80 (0.78; 0.82) for IHD. The excess relative risk (ERR) per 100 mGy for leukemia other than CLL was 0.15 (90% CI -0.001; 0.31). For all solid cancers the ERR per 100 mGy (95% CI) was 0.01 (-0.03; 0.05), for lung cancer -0.04 (-0.11; 0.02), for Parkinson's disease 0.24 (-0.02; 0.50), and for IHD -0.01 (-0.06; 0.04). CONCLUSION: Prolonged exposure to radiation increased the risk of leukemia other than CLL among NPP workers. There was little evidence for a radiation association for all solid cancers, lung cancer or ischemic heart disease. Increased precision will be forthcoming as the different cohorts within the MPS are combined, such as industrial radiographers and medical radiation workers who were assembled and evaluated in like manner.",,"['Boice, John D Jr', 'Cohen, Sarah S', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Hagemeyer, Derek A', 'Chen, Heidi', 'Golden, Ashley P', 'Yoder, R Craig', 'Dauer, Lawrence T']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Cohen SS', 'Mumma MT', 'Hagemeyer DA', 'Chen H', 'Golden AP', 'Yoder RC', 'Dauer LT']","['National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'EpidStrategies, Cary, NC, USA.', 'International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.', 'Landauer Inc (Retired), Glenwood, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Epidemiology', 'Million Person (Worker) Study', 'heart disease', 'leukemia and cancer', 'nuclear power plant workers']",2021/10/21 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/10/20 17:20'],"['2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/20 17:20 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2021.1967507 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Radiat Biol. 2022 Jan 12:1-22. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2021.1967507.,,,1-22,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8755-1299', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0421-1983', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7506-8710', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9430-7702', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5132-967X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5629-8462']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also help shape public health policy and evidence-based health practices by identifying and quantifying health risks of exposure in defined populations. For more than a century, epidemiologists have studied the consequences of radiation exposures, yet the health effects of low levels delivered at a low-dose rate remain equivocal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Million Person Study (MPS) of U.S. Radiation Workers and Veterans was designed to examine health effects following chronic exposures in contrast with brief exposures as experienced by the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Radiation associations for rare cancers, intakes of radionuclides, and differences between men and women are being evaluated, as well as noncancers such as cardiovascular disease and conditions such as dementia and cognitive function. The first international symposium, held November 6, 2020, provided a broad overview of the MPS. Representatives from four U.S. government agencies addressed the importance of this research for their respective missions: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The major components of the MPS were discussed and recent findings summarized. The importance of radiation dosimetry, an essential feature of each MPS investigation, was emphasized. RESULTS: The seven components of the MPS are DOE workers, nuclear weapons test participants, nuclear power plant workers, industrial radiographers, medical radiation workers, nuclear submariners, other U.S. Navy personnel, and radium dial painters. The MPS cohorts include tens of thousands of workers with elevated intakes of alpha particle emitters for which organ-specific doses are determined. Findings to date for chronic radiation exposure suggest that leukemia risk is lower than after acute exposure; lung cancer risk is much lower and there is little difference in risks between men and women; an increase in ischemic heart disease is yet to be seen; esophageal cancer is frequently elevated but not myelodysplastic syndrome; and Parkinson's disease may be associated with radiation exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The MPS has provided provocative insights into the possible range of health effects following low-level chronic radiation exposure. When the 34 MPS cohorts are completed and combined, a powerful evaluation of radiation-effects will be possible. This final article in the MPS special issue summarizes the findings to date and the possibilities for the future.

However, the reproducibility of these data across time and LC-MS platforms is not well characterized. Here, we evaluate the performance of three LC-MS platforms (Orbitrap Elite, Q Exactive HF, and Orbitrap Fusion) in label-free semiquantitative analysis of cell surface proteins over a six-year period. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was used for surfaceome enrichment, following gel separation for in-depth protein identification. With our established workflow, we consistently detected and reproducibly quantified >2300 putative cell surface proteins in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line on all three platforms. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting highly reproducible semiquantitative proteomic data collection of biological replicates across multiple years and LC-MS platforms. These data provide experimental justification for semiquantitative proteomic study designs that are executed over multiyear time intervals and on different platforms.

More than 60% of T-ALL patients carry NOTCH1 gene mutations, leading to abnormal expression of downstream target genes and aberrant activation of various signaling pathways. We found that chidamide, an HDAC inhibitor, exerts an antitumor effect on T-ALL cell lines and primary cells including an anti-NOTCH1 activity. In particular, chidamide inhibits the NOTCH1-MYC signaling axis by down-regulating the level of the intracellular form of NOTCH1 (NICD1) as well as MYC, partly through their ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome pathway. We also report here the preliminary results of our clinical trial supporting that a treatment by chidamide reduces minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients and is well tolerated. Our results highlight the effectiveness and safety of chidamide in the treatment of T-ALL patients, including those with NOTCH1 mutations and open the way to a new therapeutic strategy for these patients.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: The expression of Wnt pathway genes and cell cycle-related genes were analyzed in two AL cell lines. Pyrophosphate sequencing was performed to determine the methylation degree. Then, the enrichment of H4K20me1 and H3K9ac was determined using ChIP-qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle. RESULTS: The IC50 of genistein in the two AL cell lines was lower than that for the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell line. Genistein upregulated H4K20me1, KMT5A and Wnt suppressor genes, including Wnt5a, and downregulated the downstream target genes of Wnt, such as c-myc and beta-catenin. The methylation degree and H3K9ac enrichment in the Wnt5a promoter region remained unchanged. However, the enrichment of H4K20me1 in the Wnt5a promoter and coding regions increased. In addition, genistein upregulated Phospho-cdc2, Myt1, Cyclin A, Cyclin E2, p21 and Phospho-histone H3, but downregulated Phospho-wee1. Cell cycle arrest was induced in the G2/M phase. CONCLUSION: Genistein inhibits the activation of the Wnt pathway by promoting the expression of Wnt5a through the activation of KMT5A and enrichment of H4K20me1 in the Wnt5a gene promoter and coding regions, rather than demethylation. Genistein also blocks the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. Therefore, genistein is a potential anti-leukemia drug.",['(c) 2021.

Since HSCs cannot expand on their own, they require and contact the special microenvironments, termed niches for their maintenance. HSC niches comprise supportive cells that provide adjacent HSCs with critical signals, including cytokines. Although bone marrow microenvironments have been thought to be complex, recent studies have demonstrated that the bone marrow-specific population of fibroblastic reticular cells with long processes, termed CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, which overlap strongly with leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing (LepR+) cells, is the major cellular component of niches for HSCs and lymphoid progenitors. CAR cells have salient features, expressing much higher levels of critical HSC niche factors than any other cell populations and function as self-renewing mesenchymal stem cells. Human counterpart of CAR cells is present and affected in diseases, including leukemia. Foxl1+ telocytes recently identified as the niche for intestinal stem cells share some features with CAR cells, suggesting that CAR cells might serve as a prototype for fibroblastic reticular cells creating niche for long-lived cells, including tissue stem cells and memory lymphocytes. These findings provided the basis for future mechanistic studies on the cross-talk between hematopoietic cells and microenvironments in both health and disease.","['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2021.

We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2 x 10(3) and 2 x 10(4) PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lung, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2 x 10(1) and 2 x 10(2) PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered from infection with a low dose of virus survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans being dose-dependent and can provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached nearly 240 million cases, caused nearly 5 million deaths worldwide as of October 2021, and has raised an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To achieve this goal, an animal model that recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenesis and survival in response to different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that this model could be a useful tool for the development of antiviral drugs and therapeutics.",,"['Dong, Wenjuan', 'Mead, Heather', 'Tian, Lei', 'Park, Jun-Gyu', 'Garcia, Juan I', 'Jaramillo, Sierra', 'Barr, Tasha', 'Kollath, Daniel S', 'Coyne, Vanessa K', 'Stone, Nathan E', 'Jones, Ashley', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Li, Aimin', 'Wang, Li-Shu', 'Milanes-Yearsley, Martha', 'Torrelles, Jordi B', 'Martinez-Sobrido, Luis', 'Keim, Paul S', 'Barker, Bridget Marie', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Yu, Jianhua']","['Dong W', 'Mead H', 'Tian L', 'Park JG', 'Garcia JI', 'Jaramillo S', 'Barr T', 'Kollath DS', 'Coyne VK', 'Stone NE', 'Jones A', 'Zhang J', 'Li A', 'Wang LS', 'Milanes-Yearsley M', 'Torrelles JB', 'Martinez-Sobrido L', 'Keim PS', 'Barker BM', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Yu J']","['Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Disease Intervention and Prevention, and Population Health Programs, Texas Biomedical Research Institutegrid.250889.e, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Disease Intervention and Prevention, and Population Health Programs, Texas Biomedical Research Institutegrid.250889.e, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Pathology Core, Shared Resources, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Disease Intervention and Prevention, and Population Health Programs, Texas Biomedical Research Institutegrid.250889.e, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Disease Intervention and Prevention, and Population Health Programs, Texas Biomedical Research Institutegrid.250889.e, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona Universitygrid.261120.6, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20211020,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*K18-hACE2', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*infectious disease', '*lung infection', '*mouse model']",2021/10/21 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/10/20 12:17'],"['2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/20 12:17 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.00964-21 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2022 Jan 12;96(1):e0096421. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00964-21.

We aimed to assess the value of MRD monitoring by RT-qPCR in patients with APL treated with ATRA and arsenic trioxide +/- GO. We reviewed 223 patients with APL treated with this regimen. RT-qPCR for PML-RARA was measured every 3 months, and at 12, 18, and 24 months after therapy. Seven patients relapsed. Time to relapse was 7.9-12.4 months in 6 patients, and one patient relapsed after 79.5 months. These data show that MRD monitoring may be important for the detection of relapse in patients treated with this regimen within one year after completing therapy, however, since late molecular relapse is rare, our data suggest a low value of MRD monitoring beyond that first year.",,"['Ramos Perez, Jorge M', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Wierda, William', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Daver, Naval', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Short, Nicholas', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Rivera, Daniel', 'McCue, David', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Ramos Perez JM', 'Patel KP', 'Loghavi S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Borthakur G', 'Jabbour E', 'Wierda W', 'Pierce S', 'Brandt M', 'Kornblau S', 'Kadia T', 'Daver N', 'DiNardo CD', 'Jain N', 'Yilmaz M', 'Short N', 'Verstovsek S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M', 'Rivera D', 'McCue D', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ravandi F']","['Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211020,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATRA plus ATO', 'MRD monitoring']",2021/10/21 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/10/20 08:42'],"['2021/10/20 08:42 [entrez]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1992757 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Oct 20:1-4. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1992757.,,,1-4,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-6453', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6912-8569', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7621-377X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only inv(3)(q21q26.2) and t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), the classic MECOM rearrangements resulting in RPN1-MECOM rearrangement with Mecom overexpression and GATA2 haploinsufficiency, define the distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and serve as presumptive evidence for myelodysplastic syndrome based on the current World Health Organization classification. Myeloid neoplasms with nonclassic 3q26.2/MECOM rearrangements have been found to be clinically aggressive, but comparative analysis of clinicopathologic and genomic features is limited. We retrospectively studied cohorts of myeloid neoplasms with classic and nonclassic MECOM rearrangements. Cases with classic rearrangements consisted predominantly of AML, often with inv(3) or t(3;3) as the sole chromosome abnormality, whereas the group of nonclassic rearrangements included a variety of myeloid neoplasms, often with complex karyotype without TP53 mutations and similarly dismal overall survival. Immunohistochemistry revealed Mecom protein overexpression in both groups, but overexpression in cases with nonclassic rearrangements was mediated through a mechanism other than GATA2 distal enhancer involvement typical for classic rearrangement. Our results demonstrated that myeloid neoplasms with nonclassic 3q26.2/MECOM rearrangements encompass a diverse group of diseases with poor clinical outcome, overexpression of Mecom protein as a result of the nonclassic mechanism of MECOM activation.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Gao, Juehua', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Zak, Taylor', 'Kocherginsky, Masha', 'Ji, Peng', 'Wehbe, Firas', 'Chen, Qing', 'Chen, Yi-Hua', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Jennings, Lawrence', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Altman, Jessica', 'Sukhanova, Madina']","['Gao J', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Zak T', 'Kocherginsky M', 'Ji P', 'Wehbe F', 'Chen Q', 'Chen YH', 'Lu X', 'Jennings L', 'Frankfurt O', 'Altman J', 'Sukhanova M']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine (Health and Biomedical Informatics), Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine (Health and Biomedical Informatics), Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211028,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MECOM', 'genomic profile', 'molecular mechanism', 'myeloid neoplasm']",2021/10/21 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/10/20 07:06'],"['2021/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/20 07:06 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.23004 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2022 Feb;61(2):71-80. doi: 10.1002/gcc.23004.

Currently, no effective therapies are available for CIPN prevention, and symptomatic treatment is frequently ineffective; thus, several clinical trials are addressing this unmet clinical need. Among possible pharmacological treatments of CIPN, modulation of the endocannabinoid system might be particularly promising, especially in those CIPN types where analgesia and neuroinflammation modulation might be beneficial. In fact, several clinical trials are ongoing with the specific aim to better investigate the changes in endocannabinoid levels induced by systemic chemotherapy and the possible role of endocannabinoid system modulation to provide relief from CIPN symptoms, a hypothesis supported by preclinical evidence but never consistently demonstrated in patients. Interestingly, endocannabinoid system modulation might be one of the mechanisms at the basis of the reported efficacy of exercise and physical therapy in CIPN patients.

Given this, we investigated the association between the incidence of cancer and occupational exposure to pesticides through a bibliometric analysis of the studies published between 2011 and 2020, based on 62 papers selected from the Scopus database. The results indicated an exponential increase in the number of studies published over the past decade, with most of the research being conducted in the USA, France, India, and Brazil, although a further 17 nations were also involved in the research on the association between cancer and pesticides. The principal classes of pesticides investigated in relation to their role in intoxication and cancer were insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. The types of cancer reported most frequently were multiple myeloma, bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer. Despite the known association between pesticides and cancer, studies are still relatively scarce in comparison with the global scale of the use of these xenobiotic substances, which is related to the increasing demand for agricultural products throughout the world.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: A stably transfected cell line of hUCMSCs overexpressing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was constructed. Overexpression was verified by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Forty-eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal control group (group A), streptozotocin-induced diabetic control group (group B), diabetic rats at 3mo injected with empty vector-transfected hUCMSCs (group C) or injected with LIF-hUCMSCs (group D). Four weeks after the intravitreal injection, analyses in all groups included retinal function using flash electroretinogram (F-ERG), retinal blood vessel examination of retinal flat mounts perfused with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran), and retinal structure examination of sections using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Expression levels of adiponectin (APN), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in each group was detected using immunohistochemistry, PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: A stable transgenic cell line of LIF-hUCMSCs was constructed. F-ERG and FITC-dextran examinations revealed no abnormalities of retinal structure and function in group A, severe damage of the retinal blood vessels and function in group B, and improved retinal structure and function in group C and especially group D. qPCR, ELISA, and Western blot analyses revealed progressively higher APN and NT-4 expression levels in groups B, C, and D than in group A. hs-CRP expression was significantly higher in group B than in groups A, C, and D, and was significantly higher in group C than in group D (P<0.05).

The estimated incidence is 1.5 per 100,000 individuals per year with a median survival of less than six years. This statistic can vary by risk category, primarily based on clinical and cytogenetic features. Death can result from many causes, including leukemic transformation, cachexia, vascular events, and infection. Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is the only curative method for those at high risk. Unfortunately, only about 10% are eligible for this therapy. JAK2 kinase inhibitors are commonly used for high-risk patients with symptomatic splenomegaly or systemic symptoms from PMF. In clinical trials, the major endpoint is a reduction of spleen size by 35%. Secondary endpoints have included amelioration of symptomatic PMF and overall survival, which can be difficult to determine because of frequent co-morbid conditions. Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved JAK2 inhibitors have not shown increased survival or reduced risk of leukemic transformation. In relapsed or refractory disease, there is currently no standard of care. In this paper, we discuss the role of a new anti-apoptotic B cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) inhibitor, Navitoclax, for the treatment of myelofibrosis. The clinical data thus far for Navitoclax, especially in synergistic combination with traditional JAK2 inhibitors, have been promising for those with a refractory or relapsing disease on prior therapies. Following the encouraging results of phase II trials, ongoing phase III trials will primarily evaluate splenic size reduction versus the standard of care and evaluate secondary endpoints such as symptom reduction and overall survival. These studies may establish a new standard of care for refractory or relapsed myelofibrosis.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Pandravada et al.']","['Pandravada, Sasirekha', 'Sandler, Steven']","['Pandravada S', 'Sandler S']","['Internal Medicine, Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Skokie, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210914,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['bcl2 inhibitor', 'hematology', 'myelofibrosis', 'navitoclax', 'oncology', 'pmf', 'primary myelofibrosis']",2021/10/21 06:00,2021/10/21 06:01,['2021/10/20 06:45'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/20 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.17976 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Sep 14;13(9):e17976. doi: 10.7759/cureus.17976. eCollection 2021 Sep.,13,9,e17976,,,PMC8516617,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinase inhibitors, most notably those targeting ABeLson 1 (ABL1) kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia, have had a significant impact on cancer survival, yet emergence of resistance mutations can reduce their effectiveness, leading to therapeutic failure. Limited effort, however, has been devoted to developing tools to accurately identify ABL1 resistance mutations, as well as providing insights into their molecular mechanisms. Here we investigated the structural basis of ABL1 mutations modulating binding affinity of eight FDA-approved drugs. We found mutations impair affinity of type I and type II inhibitors differently and used this insight to developed a novel web-based diagnostic tool, SUSPECT-ABL, to pre-emptively predict resistance profiles and binding free-energy changes (DeltaDeltaG) of all possible ABL1 mutations against inhibitors with different binding modes. Resistance mutations in ABL1 were successfully identified, achieving a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of up to 0.73 and the resulting change in ligand binding affinity with a Pearson's correlation of up to 0.77, with performances consistent across non-redundant blind tests. Through an in silico saturation mutagenesis, our tool has identified possibly emerging resistance mutations, which offers opportunities for in vivo experimental validation. We believe SUSPECT-ABL will be an important tool not just for improving precision medicine efforts, but for facilitating the development of next-generation inhibitors that are less prone to resistance.

Surgical debridement of lesion along with liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) constitutes the mainstay of management of mucormycosis and offers best chances of survival. There are no reliable data available in the literature justifying the use of combination antifungal therapy (CAfT). We describe a child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who developed multiple localised PM during induction chemotherapy. He was managed with CAfT with L-AMB and caspofungin in view of progressive PM on high-dose L-AMB monotherapy. There was complete resolution of PM after 6 months of CAfT at the end of intensive chemotherapy of ALL. There were no significant side effects of CAfT. CAfT may be of value in cases of mucormycosis refractory to high doses of L-AMB, where surgical debridement is not feasible.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021. No commercial re-use.

Published studies have examined the cost of HCT in the US and the complications that follow but little is known about the cancer-related healthcare costs and resource utilization prior to the procedure and none of the studies have examined the variability in cost based on the type of hematologic malignancy involved. The aim of this study was to estimate mean cancer-related costs and resources incurred before the HCT is performed from the time the hematologic malignancy first develops. METHODS: The IBM(R) MarketScan(R) Research Databases were used to identify adult patients >/=18 years of age with commercial or Medicare supplemental insurance who had undergone allogeneic HCT for hematologic malignancies from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. Healthcare utilization and costs were assessed during the 6 months prior to diagnosis (pre-diagnostic period) and the follow-up period from diagnosis just prior to the HCT (pre-HCT period). Multivariable regression models were constructed to estimate total all-cause costs and cancer-related costs as well as healthcare utilization by type in each time period. RESULTS: A total of 2663 commercially insured patients and 266 with Medicare supplemental insurance were included in the study population. The mean-adjusted incremental cancer-related costs for commercially insured patients was $399,011 in the overall observation period including the pre-diagnostic and pre-HCT periods combined, 9% of which was incurred in the pre-diagnostic period. The corresponding mean-adjusted incremental cancer-related costs for Medicare supplemental patients was $195,575 for the same time period but the patterns of healthcare utilization were similar to the commercially insured population. Inpatient care accounted for approximately one-half the cost in both patient populations. By type of hematologic malignancy, costs were lowest for myeloproliferative disorders ($211,561) and highest for acute lymphocytic leukemia ($462,072) in the commercially insured population. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that overall patients with hematologic malignancies requiring HCT have considerable cancer-related healthcare resource utilization and costs leading up to HCT compared to the period of time prior to developing cancer.",['(c) 2021.

The initial treatment active against KPC-K.pneumoniae is crucial for survival and KPC-K.pneumoniae rectal colonization usually precedes KPC-KpBSI. We evaluated the impact on KPC-KpBSI mortality of the preemptive use of antibiotics active against KPC-K.pneumoniae, as opposed to inactive or standard empiric antibiotics, for the empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia episodes in patients with hematological malignancy identified as KPC-K.pneumoniae intestinal carriers. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of KPC-KpBSIs occurring in high-risk hematological patients known to be colonized with KPC-K.pneumoniae, during two time periods: March2012-December2013 (Period 1, initial approach to KPC-K.pneumoniae spread) and January2017-October2018 (Period 2, full application of the preemptive strategy). The relative importance of the various prognostic factors that could influence death rates were assessed by forward stepwise logistic regression models. RESULTS: KPC-KpBSI-related mortality in hematological patients identified as KPC-K.pneumoniae carriers dropped from 50% in Period 1 to 6% in Period 2 (p < 0.01), from 58 to 9% in acute myeloid leukemia carriers(p < 0.01). KPC-KpBSIs developed in patients identified as KPC-K.pneumoniae carriers were initially treated with active therapy in 56% and 100% of cases in Period 1 and Period 2, respectively (p < 0.01), in particular with an active antibiotic combination in 39 and 94% of cases, respectively(p < 0.01). The 61% of KPC-KpBSI observed in Period 1 developed during inactive systemic antibiotic treatment (none in Period 2, p < 0.01), fatal in the 73% of cases. Overall, KPC-KpBSI-related mortality was 88% with no initial active treatment, 11.5% with at least one initial active antibiotic (p < 0.01), 9% with initial active combination. Only the initial active treatment resulted independently associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk hematological patients colonized by KPC-K.pneumoniae, the empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia active against KPC-K.pneumoniae reduced KPC-KpBSI-related mortality to 6% and prevented fatal KPC-KpBSI occurrence during inactive systemic antibiotic treatment.",['(c) 2021.

Their expression is altered in many tumor types, and, although a role for T-UCRs as regulators of gene expression has been proposed, their functions remain largely unknown. Herein, we describe the epigenetic silencing of the uc.160+ T-UCR in gliomas and mechanistically define a novel RNA-RNA regulatory network in which uc.160+ modulates the biogenesis of several members of the miR-376 cluster. This includes the positive regulation of primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) cleavage and an enhanced A-to-I editing on its mature sequence. As a consequence, the expression of uc.160+ affects the downstream, miR-376-regulated genes, including the transcriptional coregulators RING1 and YY1-binding protein (RYBP) and forkhead box P2 (FOXP2). Finally, we elucidate the clinical impact of our findings, showing that hypermethylation of the uc.160+ CpG island is an independent prognostic factor associated with better overall survival in lower-grade gliomas, highlighting the importance of T-UCRs in cancer pathophysiology.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: Survivors of pediatric ALL (n = 38, average age at diagnosis = 4.27 years [SD = 1.97]; average time off treatment = 4.83 years [SD = 1.52]), one sibling (if available, n = 20), and one parent from each family were recruited from a long-term survivor clinic. Healthy age- and sex-matched controls (n = 38) and one parent from each family were recruited from the community. Parents completed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Parent Rating Scale (BASC-3) Social Withdrawal subscale as a measure of social adjustment, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF-2) as a measure of executive function for each of their children. Multilevel modeling and mediation analysis were used to achieve the study aims. RESULTS: Parents reported that survivors had significantly worse social adjustment compared to controls (b = 6.34, p = .004), but not survivor siblings. Among survivors, greater time off treatment (b = 2.06, p = .058) and poorer executive functioning (b = 0.42, p = .006) were associated with worse social adjustment. Executive function did not mediate differences in social withdrawal between survivors and controls or the relationship between time off treatment and social withdrawal among survivors.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 204 seropositive patients, classified into two groups, symptomatic and asymptomatic. The first group included patients with neurological symptoms associated with HTLV-1 (n = 69), and the second group, asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (n = 135). We evaluated the total unstimulated saliva flow, oral mucosa, the Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index, and Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR). The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP14) measured the oral health-related quality of life. General health-related quality of life was measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Variables with a value of p < 0.25 in bivariate analysis were selected, together with SF-36 summaries' scores and total OHIP-14, for composing a logistic regression model that had symptomatology as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The OHIP-14 total score was poor in symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, but with no marked difference between them. Symptomatic patients showed significantly lower SF-36 scores (P </= 0.05) compared to asymptomatic ones, except for mental component summary (MCS). Family income (1-2.99 minimal wages), reduced salivary flow, flossing, and lower physical component summary (PCS) were associated (P </= 0.05) with symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic individuals living with HTLV-1 showed lower HRQoL and poorer OHRQoL compared to asymptomatic ones. Family income, flossing, reduced salivary flow, and lower PCS were associated with symptomatic HTLV-1 individuals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the present study, symptomatic individuals with HTLV-1 showed higher family income, poorer oral health status, lower salivary flow, poorer OHRQoL, and lower HRQoL compared to asymptomatic ones.","['(c) 2021.

AML cells frequently have a dysregulated expression and activity of epigenetic modulators of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. Therefore, we tested whether a combined inhibition of mutant FLT3 and class I HDACs is effective against AML cells. Low nanomolar doses of the FLT3 inhibitor (FLT3i) AC220 and an inhibition of class I HDACs with nanomolar concentrations of FK228 or micromolar doses of the HDAC3 specific agent RGFP966 synergistically induce apoptosis of AML cells that carry hyperactive FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). This does not occur in leukemic cells with wild-type FLT3 and without FLT3, suggesting a preferential toxicity of this combination against cells with mutant FLT3. Moreover, nanomolar doses of the new FLT3i marbotinib combine favorably with FK228 against leukemic cells with FLT3-ITD. The combinatorial treatments potentiated their suppressive effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation and stability of FLT3-ITD and its downstream signaling to the kinases ERK1/ERK2 and the inducible transcription factor STAT5. The beneficial pro-apoptotic effects of FLT3i and HDACi against leukemic cells with mutant FLT3 are associated with dose- and drug-dependent alterations of cell cycle distribution and DNA damage. This is linked to a modulation of the tumor-suppressive transcription factor p53 and its target cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. While HDACi induce p21, AC220 suppresses the expression of p53 and p21. Furthermore, we show that both FLT3-ITD and class I HDAC activity promote the expression of the checkpoint kinases CHK1 and WEE1, thymidylate synthase, and the DNA repair protein RAD51 in leukemic cells. A genetic depletion of HDAC3 attenuates the expression of such proteins. Thus, class I HDACs and hyperactive FLT3 appear to be valid targets in AML cells with mutant FLT3.",['(c) 2021.

This research aims to explore new differentially expressed lncRNAs and their effects on AML. METHODS: Database-based bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed lncRNA in AML, real-time PCR was used to analyze gene expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to determine prognostic effect of AC026150.8 in AML. The cell drug resistance experiment was performed to test effect of AC026150.8 on chemo-resistance of AML cells. Catrapid online software and RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, western-blot were used to predict and verify the combination of AC026150.8 and RNA splicing factors. RESULTS: AC026150.8 was upregulated in AML patients and related to poor prognosis. High leukocyte counts, FAB classification, MLL-AF9 expression and NPM1 mutations were associated with high AC026150.8 expression. Upregulated of AC026150.8 increased the drug resistance of AML cells. AC026150.8 could be combined with splicing factor PCBP1. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study found that the upregulated AC026150.8 in AML is related to poor prognosis, overexpression of AC026150.8 could increase drug resistance of AML cells, and confirmed its scaffolding effect in combination with splicing factors. It is necessary to further study AC026150.8 and its downstream target genes to clarify the mechanism of AC026150.8 in AML.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, data on PIT prediction and impacts on transplantation outcomes for UCBT patients are rare. We retrospectively analyzed 244 patients with hematological malignancies who received single-unit UCBT at the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC between August 2018 and December 2019. Among them, PIT occurred in 49 recipients, with a crude incidence of 20.1%. In the PIT patients, the 2-year cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher, and the probabilities of 2-year overall survival, leukemia-free survival and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free relapse-free survival were significantly poorer (57.1% vs. 88.6%; 53.1% vs. 81.9%; 22.4% vs. 59.8%; p < 0.001), without remarkable increases in the cumulative incidence of relapse or chronic GVHD. Importantly, the multivariate analysis revealed that lower high-resolution HLA compatibility (</=6/10), lower infused CD34(+) cell count (</=1.78 x 10(5) /kg), grade II-IV acute GVHD preplatelet engraftment, a lower pretransplantation platelet count (</=100 x 10(9) /L), and a longer neutrophil engraftment time (>/=17 days) were independent risk factors for PIT after UCBT. These results demonstrate that PIT is common after UCBT, predicting inferior survival and the need for more monitoring during the early phase.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wu, Yue', 'Zhang,

METHODS: Next-generation sequencing of 42 myeloid neoplasm-related genes in 293 newly diagnosed patients with AML. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients had AML-MRC, and 161 patients had de novo AML. The mutation rates of ASXL1 (25% vs 8.7%, P = .001), NRAS (17.9% vs 8.1%, P = .022), PTPN11 (11.9% vs 5%, P = .048), SETBP1 (6% vs 0.6%, P = .033), SRSF2 (11.9% vs 5.6%, P = .08), TP53 (16.7% vs 1.2%, P < .001), and U2AF1 (17.9% vs 7.5%, P = .014) in AML-MRC were higher than those in de novo AML, while the rates of FLT3-ITD (3.6% vs 15.5%, P = .005), KIT (0% vs 6.2%, P = .046), WT1 (3.6% vs 9.9%, P = .077), NPM1 (1.2% vs 21.7%, P < .001), and CEBPA (4.8% vs 24.2%, P < .001) mutation were lower. The appearance of ASXL1, TP53, U2AF1, SRSF2, and SETBP1 mutation could predict AML-MRC-like features in de novo AML, which was related to older age (60 vs 51 years, P = .001), low WBC counts (4.7 x 109/L vs 11.6 x 109/L, P = .001), and inferior outcomes (median overall survival, 15 months vs not reached, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of AML-MRC-related mutations can reveal a subset of patients with de novo AML similar to patients with AML-MRC.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated according to the relativity between age-standardized rate and calendar year, to quantify temporal trends in morbidity and mortality of ALL. We used applied Spearman rank correlation to estimate the relationship between the EAPC and potential influence factors. The population attributable fraction of potential risk factors for ALL-related disability-adjusted life years were estimated by the comparative risk assessment framework. As a result, we found that new ALL cases increased significantly by 1.29% worldwide, and the age-standardized incidence rate increased by 1.61% annually. The proportion of elder patients sharply increased, especially within the higher socio-demographic index (SDI) region. Smoking and high body mass index remained the predominant risk factors for ALL-related mortality. Notably, the contribution of high body mass index presented an increasing trend. In conclusion, the global burden of ALL has steadily increased, especially in Middle SDI region. Health measures and new drugs should be taken into consideration to improve the management and treatment of elders with ALL due to an increasing proportion in the higher SDI region.

The potential to non-invasively monitor tumour evolutionary dynamics of DLBCL needs to be further established. In the present study, 17 tumour biopsy and 38 plasma samples from 38 patients with high-intermediate/high-risk DLBCL were evaluated at baseline. Longitudinal blood samples were also collected during therapy. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) was analysed using targeted sequencing based on a gene panel via a recently developed methodology, circulating single-molecule amplification and re-sequencing technology (cSMART). We found that the most frequently mutated genes were tumour protein p53 (TP53; 42.1%), histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D; 28.9%), caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11; 21.1%), cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein (CREBBP; 15.8%), beta2 -microglobulin (B2M; 15.8%), and tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3; 15.8%). The mutation profiles between ctDNA and matched tumour tissue showed good concordance; however, more mutation sites were detected in ctDNA samples. Either TP53 or B2M mutations before treatment predicted poor prognosis. Analysis of dynamic blood samples confirmed the utility of ctDNA for the real-time assessment of treatment response and revealed that the increases in ctDNA levels and changes in KMT2D mutation status could be useful predictors of disease progression. Our present results suggest that ctDNA is a promising method for the detection of mutation spectrum and serves as a biomarker for disease monitoring and predicting clinical recurrence.",['(c) 2021

Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer that arises when this balance is tipped in favour of survival. One form of anticancer therapeutic, termed 'BH3-mimetic drugs', has been developed to directly activate the apoptosis machinery in malignant cells. These drugs bind to and inhibit specific prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins, thereby mimicking their interaction with the BH3 domains of proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. The BCL-2-specific inhibitor venetoclax is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and many regulatory authorities worldwide for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia. BH3-mimetic drugs targeting other BCL-2 prosurvival proteins have been tested in preclinical models of cancer, and drugs targeting MCL-1 or BCL-XL have advanced into phase I clinical trials for certain cancers. As with all therapeutics, efficacy and tolerability need to be carefully balanced to achieve a therapeutic window whereby there is significant anticancer activity with an acceptable safety profile. In this Review, we outline the current state of BH3-mimetic drugs targeting various prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins and discuss emerging data regarding primary and acquired resistance to these agents and approaches that may overcome this. We highlight issues that need to be addressed to further advance the clinical application of BH3-mimetic drugs, both alone and in combination with additional anticancer agents (for example, standard chemotherapeutic drugs or inhibitors of oncogenic kinases), for improved responses in patients with cancer.",['(c) 2021.

Here we map fusion-specific targets across the genome for diverse KMT2A oncofusion proteins in cell lines and patient samples. By modifying CUT&Tag chromatin profiling for full automation, we identify common and tumor-subtype-specific sites of aberrant chromatin regulation induced by KMT2A oncofusion proteins. A subset of KMT2A oncofusion-binding sites are marked by bivalent (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) chromatin signatures, and single-cell CUT&Tag profiling reveals that these sites display cell-to-cell heterogeneity suggestive of lineage plasticity. In addition, we find that aberrant enrichment of H3K4me3 in gene bodies is sensitive to Menin inhibitors, demonstrating the utility of automated chromatin profiling for identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, integration of automated and single-cell CUT&Tag can uncover epigenomic heterogeneity within patient samples and predict sensitivity to therapeutic agents.",['(c) 2021.

The median age at BMT was 63 years (range, 41-74). Conditioning regimens were reduced intensity in 54% and nonmyeloablative in 39%. Peripheral blood grafts were used in 86%. The median follow-up was 23.1 months (range, 1.6-75.7). At 3 years, the overall survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)-free-RFS were 72% (95% CI 59-81), 44% (95% CI 29-59), and 30% (95% CI 17-43). Cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and relapse were 23% (95% CI 14-34) and 31% (95% CI 17-47) at 3 years. Spleen size >/=22 cm or prior splenectomy (HR 6.37, 95% CI 2.02-20.1, P = 0.002), and bone marrow grafts (HR 4.92, 95% CI 1.68-14.4, P = 0.004) were associated with increased incidence of relapse. Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade 3-4 was 10% at 3 months and extensive chronic GVHD was 8%. Neutrophil engraftment was reported in 94% patients, at a median of 20 days (range, 14-70). In conclusion, haplo-BMT with PTCy is feasible in patients with myelofibrosis. Splenomegaly >/=22 cm and bone marrow grafts were associated with a higher incidence of relapse in this study.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we show by paired single-cell RNA analysis and TCR repertoire profiling of bone marrow cells in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients pre/post azacytidine+nivolumab treatment that the disease-related T cell subsets are highly heterogeneous, and their abundance changes following PD-1 blockade-based treatment. TCR repertoires expand and primarily emerge from CD8(+) cells in patients responding to treatment or having a stable disease, while TCR repertoires contract in therapy(-)resistant patients. Trajectory analysis reveals a continuum of CD8(+) T cell phenotypes, characterized by differential expression of granzyme B and a bone marrow-residing memory CD8(+) T cell subset, in which a population with stem-like properties expressing granzyme K is enriched in responders. Chromosome 7/7q loss, on the other hand, is a cancer-intrinsic genomic marker of PD-1 blockade resistance in AML. In summary, our study reveals that adaptive T cell plasticity and genomic alterations determine responses to PD-1 blockade in acute myeloid leukemia.",['(c) 2021.

DNMT3A R882 mutations in AML patients promote resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy and drive relapse. In this study, we performed high-throughput screening and identified that oridonin, an ent-kaurene diterpenoid extracted from the Chinese herb Rabdosia rubescens, inhibits DNMT3A R882 mutant leukemic cells at a low-micromolar concentration (IC50 = 2.1 microM) by activating both RIPK1-Caspase-8-Caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis. The inhibitory effect of oridonin against DNMT3A R882 mutant leukemia cells can also be observed in vivo. Furthermore, oridonin inhibits clonal hematopoiesis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with Dnmt3a R878H mutation comparing to normal HSCs by inducing apoptosis and necroptosis. Overall, oridonin is a potential and promising drug candidate or lead compound targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal hematopoiesis and leukemia.",['(c) 2021.

However, only half of treated patients respond and of these almost all eventually relapse. New treatment options are urgently needed to improve the clinical management of these patients. Here, we perform a loss-of-function shRNA screen and identify the histone acetyl transferase and transcriptional co-activator, CREB binding protein (CBP), as a major regulator of AZA sensitivity. Compounds inhibiting the activity of CBP and the closely related p300 synergistically reduce viability of MDS-derived AML cell lines when combined with AZA.

However, whether their interaction is pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic in nature has not been determined. This study quantitatively determined whether these drugs have a pharmacokinetic interaction that alters systemic disposition or central nervous system (CNS) distribution. We performed intravenous and oral in vivo pharmacokinetic assessments of both drugs after discrete dosing and administration in combination to determine whether the combination had any effect on systemic pharmacokinetic parameters or CNS exposure. Drugs were administered at 5 or 10 mg/kg i.v. or 30 mg/kg orally to institute for cancer research (ICR) mice and 5 mg/kg i.v. to Friend leukemia virus strain B mice of the following genotypes: wild-type, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp(-/-) ) (Bcrp knockout), Mdr1a/b(-/-) [P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout], and Bcrp(-/-) Mdr1a/b(-/-) (triple knockout). In the combination, clearance of oxymorphindole (OMI) was reduced by approximately half, and the plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased. Consequently, brain and spinal cord AUCs for OMI in the combination also increased proportionately. Both loperamide and OMI are P-gp substrates, but administration of the two drugs in combination does not alter efflux transport at the CNS barriers. Because OMI alone shows appreciable brain penetration but little therapeutic efficacy on its own, and because loperamide's CNS distribution is unchanged in the combination, the mechanism of action for the increased potency of the combination is most likely pharmacodynamic and most likely occurs at receptors in the peripheral nervous system. This combination has favorable characteristics for future development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opioids have yet to be replaced as the most effective treatments for moderate-to-severe pain and chronic pain, but their side effects are dangerous. Combinations of opioids with peripheral activity, such as loperamide and oxymorphindole, would be valuable in that they are effective at much lower doses and have reduced risks for dangerous side effects because the micro-opioid receptor agonist is largely excluded from the CNS.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Griffith,

Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is an immune checkpoint protein (ICP) that is neoexpressed in most tumor cells as a way to evade immune attack and has been recently demonstrated as a useful target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy of leukemia by in vitro studies. Here, we design and test for targeting HLA-G in solid tumors using a CAR strategy. METHODS: We developed a novel CAR strategy using natural killer (NK) cell as effector cells, featuring enhanced cytolytic effect via DAP12-based intracellular signal amplification. A single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against HLA-G is designed as the targeting moiety, and the construct is tested both in vitro and in vivo on four different solid tumor models. We also evaluated the synergy of this anti-HLA-G CAR-NK strategy with low-dose chemotherapy as combination therapy. RESULTS: HLA-G CAR-transduced NK cells present effective cytolysis of breast, brain, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer cells in vitro, as well as reduced xenograft tumor growth with extended median survival in orthotopic mouse models. In tumor coculture assays, the anti-HLA-G scFv moiety promotes Syk/Zap70 activation of NK cells, suggesting reversal of the HLA-G-mediated immunosuppression and hence restoration of native NK cytolytic functions. Tumor expression of HLA-G can be further induced using low-dose chemotherapy, which when combined with anti-HLA-G CAR-NK results in extensive tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo. This upregulation of tumor HLA-G involves inhibition of DNMT1 and demethylation of transporter associated with antigen processing 1 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel CAR-NK strategy exploits the dual nature of HLA-G as both a tumor-associated neoantigen and an ICP to counteract tumor spread. Further ablation of tumors can be boosted when combined with administration of chemotherapeutic agents in clinical use. The readiness of this novel strategy envisions a wide applicability in treating solid tumors.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Without diagnosis and management in early stages, this type of cancer can be fatal. Changes in protooncogenic genes and microRNA genes are the most important factors involved in development of leukemia. At present, leukemia risk factors are not accurately identified, but some studies have pointed out factors that predispose to leukemia. Studies show that in the absence of genetic risk factors, leukemia can be prevented by reducing the exposure to risk factors of leukemia, including smoking, exposure to benzene compounds and high-dose radioactive or ionizing radiation. One of the most important treatments for leukemia is chemotherapy which has devastating side effects. Chemotherapy and medications used during treatment do not have a specific effect and destroy healthy cells besides leukemia cells. Despite the suppressing effect of chemotherapy against leukemia, patients undergoing chemotherapy have poor quality of life. So today, researchers are focusing on finding more safe and effective natural compounds and treatments for cancer, especially leukemia. Chitosan is a valuable natural compound that is biocompatible and non-toxic to healthy cells. Anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant effects are examples of chitosan biopolymer properties. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of this compound in medical treatments and the pharmaceutical industry.

First, we identified the pathogenic germline variants in cancer-predisposing genes among 15 children with SMNs after childhood leukemia/lymphoma using whole-exome sequencing. Because the prevalence was low, we focused on the association between SMNs and NUDT15 in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. NUDT15 is one of the 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) metabolic genes, and its variants are common in East Asian individuals. The prevalence of NUDT15 hypomorphic variants was higher in patients with SMNs (n = 14; 42.9%) than in the general population in the gnomAD database (19.7%; P = .042). In the validation study with a cohort of 438 unselected patients with ALL, the cumulative incidence of SMNs was significantly higher among those with (3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6% to 9.4%) than among those without NUDT15 variants (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.0% to 1.5%; P = .045). The 6-MP dose administered to patients with ALL with a NUDT15 variant was higher than that given to those without SMNs (P = .045). The 6-MP-related mutational signature was observed in SMN specimens after 6-MP exposure. In cells exposed to 6-MP, a higher level of 6-MP induced DNA damage in NUDT15-knockdown induced pluripotent stem cells. Our study indicates that NUDT15 variants may confer a risk of SMNs after treatment with 6-MP in patients with ALL.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, results remain inferior to children with ALL. The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) ALL06 study (anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12611000814976) was designed to assess whether a pediatric ALL regimen (Australian and New Zealand Children's Haematology and Oncology Group [ANZCHOG] Study 8) could be administered to patients aged 15 to 39 years in a comparable time frame to children as assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction/consolidation and commencing the next phase of therapy (protocol M or high-risk [HR] treatment) by day 94. Minimal residual disease (MRD) response stratified patients to HR treatment and transplantation. From 2012 to 2018, a total of 86 patients were enrolled; 82 were eligible. Median age was 22 years (range, 16-38 years). Induction/consolidation was equally deliverable in ALL06 as in Study 8. In ALL06, 41.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.7-52.9) commenced protocol M or HR therapy by day 94 vs 39.3% in Study 8 (P = .77). Median time to protocol M/HR treatment was 96 days (interquartile range, 87.5-103 days) in ALL06 vs 98 days in Study 8 (P = .80). Induction mortality was 3.6%. With a median follow-up of 44 months (1-96 months), estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 72.8% (95% CI, 62.8-82.7), and estimated 3-year overall survival was 74.9% (95% CI, 65.3-84.5). End induction/consolidation MRD negativity rate was 58.6%. Body mass index >/=30 kg/m2 and day 79 MRD positivity were associated with poorer disease-free survival and overall survival. Pediatric therapy was safe and as deliverable in AYA patients as in children with ALL. Intolerance of pediatric ALL induction/consolidation is not a major contributor to inferior outcomes in AYA ALL.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

The IgH surrogate light chain (SLC), comprised of the VpreB1 (CD179a) and Lamda5 (CD179b) subunits is expressed on pro- and pre-B cells where it governs preBCR-mediated autonomous survival signaling. We hypothesized that the pre-BCR might merit the development of targeted immunotherapies to decouple ""autonomous"" signaling in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We used the COG minimal residual disease (MRD) flow panel to assess pre-BCR expression in 36 primary patient samples accrued to COG standard and high-risk B-ALL studies through AALL03B1. We also assessed CD179a expression in 16 cases with Day 29 end-induction samples, pre-selected to have >/=1% MRD. All analyses were performed on a 6-color Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer in a CLIA/CAP-certified laboratory. Among 36 cases tested, thirty-two were at the pre-B and four were at the pro-B stages of developmental arrest. One or both mAbs showed that CD179a was present in >/=20% of the B-lymphoblast population. All cases expressed CD179a in the end-induction B-lymphoblast population. The CD179a component of the SLC is commonly expressed in B-ALL, regardless of genotype, stage of developmental arrest or NCI risk-status.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Winter, Stuart Sheldon', 'McCaustland, Amanda', 'Qu, Chunxu', ""Simeona, No'eau"", 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Gheorghe, Gabriela', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Wilson, Bridget S']","['Winter SS', 'McCaustland A', 'Qu C', 'Simeona N', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Wood BL', 'Gheorghe G', 'Mullighan CG', 'Wilson BS']","[""Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States."", ""Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States."", 'Lawrence University, Appleton, Wisconsin, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.', 'Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States."", 'University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:00,['2021/10/18 20:23'],"['2021/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/18 20:23 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['477380 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005245 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Oct 18. pii: 477380. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005245.,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7414-3969', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work aimed to investigate this association accounting for genetic polymorphisms of the Th2 pathway cytokines (IL4, IL10, IL13, and IL4R). METHODS: Analyses were based on the French case-control study ESTELLE (2010-2011). The complete sample included 629 ALL cases and 1421 population-based controls frequency-matched on age and gender. The child's medical history was collected through standardized maternal interview. Biological samples were collected, and genotyping data were available for 411 cases and 704 controls of European origin. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: In the complete sample, a significant inverse association was observed between ALL and reported history of allergic rhinitis or sinusitis (OR = 0.65 [0.42-0.98]; P = 0.04), but there was no obvious association with allergies overall. There was an interaction between genetic polymorphisms in IL4 and IL4R (Pinteraction = 0.003), as well as a gene-environment interaction between IL4R-rs1801275 and a reported history of asthma (IOR = 0.23; Pint = 0.008) and eczema (IOR = 0.47; Pint = 0.06). We observed no interaction with the candidate polymorphisms in IL4 and IL13. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the association between allergic symptoms and childhood ALL could be modified by IL4R-rs1801275, and that this variant could also interact with a functional variant in IL4 gene. Although they warrant confirmation, these results could help understand the pathological mechanisms under the reported inverse association between allergy and childhood ALL.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Ajrouche, Roula', 'Chandab, Ghinaj', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Strullu, Marion', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Plat, Genevieve', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Domenech, Carine', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Bonaventure, Audrey']","['Ajrouche R', 'Chandab G', 'Petit A', 'Strullu M', 'Nelken B', 'Plat G', 'Michel G', 'Domenech C', 'Clavel J', 'Bonaventure A']","['CRESS, Universite de Paris INSERM, UMR 1153, Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.', 'CRESS, Universite de Paris INSERM, UMR 1153, Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.', 'Sorbonne Universite, UMRS_938, AP-HP, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Jeanne de Flandre, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Hopital des Enfants, Toulouse, France.', 'AP-HM, Hopital la Timone, Marseille, France.', ""Institut d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Pediatrique, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, Lyon, France."", 'CRESS, Universite de Paris INSERM, UMR 1153, Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team, Villejuif, France.', 'National Registry of Childhood Cancers, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Paris-Sud, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France and CHU de Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, Nancy, France.', 'CRESS, Universite de Paris INSERM, UMR 1153, Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['allergy', 'case-control studies', 'childhood leukemia', 'cytokines', 'epidemiology', 'etiology', 'gene-environment interaction', 'gene-gene interaction', 'genetics', 'lymphoblastic leukemia']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:00,['2021/10/18 17:30'],"['2021/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 17:30 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29402 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Oct 18:e29402. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29402.,,,e29402,,,,"['Institut National Du Cancer', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer', 'Association Enfants et Sante', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale', 'Canceropole Ile de France', 'INCa-DHOS', 'ANR-10-COHO-0009/Agence Nationale de la Recherche', 'Universite Libanaise', 'PDF20190508759/Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer', ""PNREST Anses/Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de"", ""l'Environnement et du Travail"", ""Cancer TMOI AVIESAN/Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de"", ""l'Environnement et du Travail"", ""2013/1/24/Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de"", ""l'Environnement et du Travail""]",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9549-2498', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8363-1622', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6665-8145']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the off-target inhibition of IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) by ibrutinib may also play a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment, potentially enhancing the treatment benefit. However, resistance to covalently binding BTK inhibitors can develop by a mutation in cysteine 481 of BTK (C481S), which prevents the irreversible binding of the drugs. In the present study we performed pre-clinical characterization of vecabrutinib, a next generation non-covalent BTK inhibitor, with ITK inhibitory properties similar to those of ibrutinib. Unlike ibrutinib and other covalent BTK inhibitors, vecabrutinib showed retention of the inhibitory effect on C481S BTK mutants in vitro, similar to that of wildtype BTK. In the murine Emicro-TCL1 adoptive transfer model, vecabrutinib reduced tumor burden and significantly improved survival. Vecabrutinib treatment led to a decrease in CD8+ effector and memory T-cell populations, while the naive populations were increased. Of importance, vecabrutinib treatment significantly reduced frequency of regulatory CD4+ T-cells (Tregs) in vivo. Unlike ibrutinib, vecabrutinib treatment showed minimal adverse impact on activation and proliferation of isolated T-cells. Lastly, combination treatment of vecabrutinib with venetoclax was found to augment treatment efficacy, significantly improve survival and lead to favourable reprogramming of the microenvironment in the murine Emicro-TCL1 model. Thus, non-covalent BTK/ITK inhibitors such as vecabrutinib may be efficacious in C481S BTK mutant CLL, while preserving the T-cell immunomodulatory function of ibrutinib.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Jebaraj, Billy Michael Chelliah', 'Muller, Annika', 'Dheenadayalan, Rashmi Priyadharshini', 'Endres, Sascha', 'Roessner, Philipp M', 'Seyfried, Felix', 'Walliser, Claudia', 'Wist, Martin', 'Qi, Jialei', 'Tausch, Eugen', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Fox, Judith A', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Meyer, Lueder Hinrich', 'Taverna, Pietro', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Gierschik, Peter', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Jebaraj BMC', 'Muller A', 'Dheenadayalan RP', 'Endres S', 'Roessner PM', 'Seyfried F', 'Walliser C', 'Wist M', 'Qi J', 'Tausch E', 'Mertens D', 'Fox JA', 'Debatin KM', 'Meyer LH', 'Taverna P', 'Seiffert M', 'Gierschik P', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States.', 'University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211018,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:00,['2021/10/18 17:25'],"['2021/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/18 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01757-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011516 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Oct 18. pii: S0006-4971(21)01757-2. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011516.,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7243-6829', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7061-5690', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9168-2291', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0227-7188', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8397-1886', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9295-5231']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the duration of MBL and the mechanisms of its evolution to CLL remain largely unknown. In this study, we sequenced the B-cell receptor immunoglobulin heavy chain (BcR IGH) gene repertoire of 124 CLL patients and 118 matched controls in blood samples taken up to 22 years prior to diagnosis. Significant skewing in the BcR IGH gene repertoire was detected in the majority of patients, even before the occurrence of lymphocytosis and irrespective of the clonotypic IGH variable gene somatic hypermutation status. Furthermore, in 14 CLL patients we identified dominant clonotypes belonging to major stereotyped subsets associated with poor prognosis up to 16 years before diagnosis. In 22 patients with longitudinal samples, the skewing of the BcR IGH gene repertoire increased significantly over time to diagnosis or remained stable at high levels. For 14/16 patients with available samples at diagnosis, the CLL clonotype was already present in the pre-diagnostic samples.

34662086,,Publisher,,,2022 Jan,Biosimilars Use In Medicine For Inflammatory Diseases,,"Biosimilars are biological agents that are highly analogous to their reference products currently approved and licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Biosimilars possess no differences in their safety, purity, potency, or effectiveness compared to their respective reference biologic agents. The abbreviated licensure pathway 351(k) for biosimilars or agents interchangeable with FDA-approved biological agents (reference product) was formed by Congress by The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act) of 2009.[1] Biosimilars aim to increase the number of biologics available at more inexpensive costs when compared to their reference products, further increasing patient access to more treatment options.[2] Similar to biologics or reference products, biosimilars are expected to meet the FDA's meticulous approval criteria, ensuring the reliability of the agent's safety, efficacy, quality, and effectiveness.[3] The FDA approval process for biosimilars is based on data proving its prominent similarity and correlation to an already FDA-approved biologic agent (reference product) and its indications for use. No clinically meaningful differences among the biosimilar and its respective reference agent should exist.[3] Differences exist in the regulatory provisions for the original biologic agent (reference product) and a biosimilar as the biosimilars obtain approval from FDA by their abbreviated approval pathway.[4] Biosimilars seeking FDA approval must include data assessments demonstrating the agent's similarity to a reference product acquired from analytical investigations, animal studies, and clinical studies. Added data and analyses of the biosimilars immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and data discussing the indication(s) the reference product is licensed and approved for use are also included.[5] To date, ten biological agents: bevacizumab, etanercept, epoetin-alfa, trastuzumab, adalimumab, pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, infliximab, rituximab, and insulin glargine, have been used as reference products for the approval of 30 biosimilar agents. Biosimilars can be used in the management of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), plaque psoriasis (PsO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): adult Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Filgrastim-sndz, a biosimilar of the reference product ""filgrastim,"" was the first-ever biosimilar to receive FDA approval in March 2015 and is characterized as a leukocyte growth factor indicated to reduce infections caused by febrile neutropenia in the neutropenic and immunosuppressed subjects. Other indications of biosimilars alongside inflammatory diseases include management for specific malignancies and secondary causes of anemia. In September 2017, bevacizumab-awwb was the first biosimilar that was granted FDA approval for certain cancers. A few months later, in December 2017, biosimilar trastuzumab-dkst was also granted FDA approval for specific malignancies. Cancers indicative of biosimilar therapy include non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) associated breast cancer, and HER2 associated gastric (metastatic) or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). To date, new biosimilars are currently still being FDA approved, with the latest approval coming on July 28, 2021, for biosimilar agent insulin glargine-yfgn, a long-acting insulin agent indicated for pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and adult patients with DM type 1 and DM type 2. Biosimilars agent insulin glargine-yfgn is the first insulin biosimilar agent to receive FDA approval and is also the first interchangeable agent in the class of biosimilar agents. Interchangeable products are biosimilars that meet additional criteria specified by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act during the assessment and testing of the agent during its FDA approval process.[6] Data is required demonstrating clinical results as its respective reference product in any subject treated with the interchangeable products.[6] Data on the interchangeable products substituted with their reference product in terms of safety and efficacy of alternating back and forth have been assessed and evaluated by the FDA prior to their approval. Once an interchangeable product has been approved, it may be interchanged for their reference product without requiring additional consulting from the prescribing clinician or healthcare professional.[7][8] Table 1: Summarizes all FDA approved biosimilars","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Padda, Inderbir S.', 'Bhatt, Rajat', 'Rehman, Obaid', 'Parmar, Mayur']","['Padda IS', 'Bhatt R', 'Rehman O', 'Parmar M']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,2021/10/19 06:01,2021/10/19 06:01,,,['NBK574572 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20211019,['20220106'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],,,['2021/10/19 06:01'],,,,,,

The disease is characterized by the presence of translocation t(9;22) leading to the abnormal BCR-ABL fusion. Historically, treatment options included hydroxyurea, busulfan, and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), with allogeneic stem cell transplant being the only potential curative therapy. More recently, the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the treatment of CML and turned a once fatal disease into a chronic and manageable disorder. This review aims to discuss the frontline treatment options in chronic-phase CML, provide recommendations for tailoring frontline treatment to the patient, and explore emerging therapies in the field. RECENT FINDINGS: The first-generation TKI, imatinib, was FDA approved in 2001 for use in CML. Following the approval and success of imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs have been developed providing deeper responses, faster responses, and different toxicity profiles. With numerous options available in the frontline setting, choosing the best initial treatment for each individual patient has become a more complex decision. When choosing a frontline therapy for patients with chronic-phase CML, one should consider disease risk, comorbid conditions, and the goal of therapy.","['(c) 2021.

The GIMEMA CML working party recently suggested that the possibility of achieving TFR cannot be denied to any patient, and proposed specific treatment policies according to the patient's age and risk. However, other international recommendations (including 2020 ELN recommendations) are more focused on survival and provide less detailed suggestions on how to choose first and subsequent lines of treatment. Consequently, some grey areas remain. After literature review, a panel of Italian experts discussed the following controversial issues: (1) early prediction of DMR and TFR: female sex, non-high disease risk score, e14a2 transcript and early MR achievement have been associated with stable DMR, but the lack of these criteria is not sufficient to exclude any patient from TFR; (2) criteria for first and subsequent line therapy choice: a number of patient and drug characteristics have been proposed to make a personalized decision; (3) monitoring of residual disease after discontinuation: after the first 6 months, the frequency of molecular tests can be reduced based on MR4.5 persistence and short turnaround time; (4) prognosis of TFR: therapy and DMR duration are important to predict TFR; although immunological control of CML plays a role, no immunological predictive phenotype is currently available. This guidance is intended as a practical tool to support physicians in decision making.",['(c) 2021.

In some cases, T cells are transduced with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes during the ex vivo culture period. Although such strategies have been shown to be effective in some types of cancer, there remain issues to be solved; these methods (i) are time-consuming, (ii) are costly and (iii) it is difficult to guarantee the quality because the products depend on patient-derived T cells. To address these issues, several groups including ours have developed methods in which cytotoxic cells are mass-produced by using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. For the regeneration of T cells, the basic idea is as follows: iPSCs produced from T cells inherit rearranged TCR genes, and thus all regenerated T cells should express the same TCR. Based on this idea, various types of T cells have been regenerated, including conventional cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), gammadeltaT cells, NKT cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. On the other hand, any cytotoxic cells can be used as the base cells into which CAR is introduced, and thus iPSC-derived NK cells have been developed. To apply the iPSC-based cell therapy in an allogeneic setting, the authors' group developed a method in which non-T-cell-derived iPSCs are transduced with exogenous TCR genes (TCR-iPSC method). This approach is being prepared for a clinical trial to be realized in Kyoto University Hospital, in which acute myeloid leukemia patients will be treated by the regenerated WT1 antigen-specific CTLs.","['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2021.

However, to achieve therapeutic success, it is necessary to reach adequate plasma concentrations to ensure efficacy and safety.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the plasma concentration of imatinib, analysing its influence on effectiveness and safety in patients with CML. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, multicentre study in which imatinib plasma levels from patients diagnosed with CML between 2019-2020 were analysed. An optimal therapeutic range of 750-1500 ng/mL was established for the stratification of patients, according to their minimum plasma concentrations measured at steady state (Cssmin). RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were included, of whom only 39.3% (n = 11) showed Cssmin within the therapeutic range. 100% of patients with Cssmin >750 ng/mL achieved an optimal molecular response, while only 50% of patients with Cssmin <750 ng/mL achieved an optimal molecular response (p = 0.0004). The toxicity rate was 36.4% for patients with Cssmin >1500 ng/mL and 5.9% for those with Cssmin <1500 ng/mL (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: This study aimed to describe the correlation between the toxicity and effectiveness of imatinib according to its Cssmin in routine clinical practice conditions.

Aplastic anemia induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an uncommon complication. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old female case with CML in the chronic phase was treated with Imatinib in first-line therapy. Nilotinib was switched because of failure to achieve complete cytogenetic response at 6 months following Imatinib. Three years with Nilotinib, the patient developed a persistent pancytopenia grade 4 while a major molecular response was achieved. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Nilotinib was discontinued. However, the hematologic finding of the patient had not recovered after three months. A bone marrow biopsy showed marked hypocellularity and fatty tissue without evidence of myelofibrosis. Immunosuppressive therapy was started. Unfortunately, the patient died due to septic and hemorrhagic shock nine months after Nilotinib interruption. According to Naranjo's algorithm, the causality relationship with the drug is probable with a score of 5. DISCUSSION: Aplastic anemia is an uncommon adverse event of tyrosine kinase inhibitors but it can be a fatal complication.

Here we characterize premalignant cells and the multicellular ecosystem in HTLV-1 infection with and without adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) by genome sequencing and single-cell simultaneous transcriptome and T/B-cell receptor sequencing with surface protein analysis. We distinguish malignant phenotypes caused by HTLV-1 infection and leukemogenesis and dissect clonal evolution of malignant cells with different clinical behavior. Within HTLV-1-infected cells, a regulatory T-cell phenotype associates with premalignant clonal expansion. We also delineate differences between virus- and tumor-related changes in the nonmalignant hematopoietic pool, including tumor-specific myeloid propagation. In a newly generated conditional knockout mouse model recapitulating T-cell-restricted CD274 (encoding PD-L1) gene lesions found in ATL, we demonstrate that PD-L1 overexpressed by T cells is transferred to surrounding cells, leading to their PD-L1 upregulation. Our findings provide insights into clonal evolution and immune landscape of multistep virus carcinogenesis. Significance: Our multimodal single-cell analyses comprehensively dissect the cellular and molecular alterations of the peripheral blood in HTLV-1 infection, with and without progression to leukemia.

Although most APL cases are cured by PML/RARalpha-targeting therapy, relapse and resistance can occur due to drug-resistant mutations. Here we report that thermal stress destabilizes the PML/RARalpha protein, including clinically identified drug-resistant mutants. AML1/ETO and TEL/AML1 oncofusions show similar heat shock susceptibility. Mechanistically, mild hyperthermia stimulates aggregation of PML/RARalpha in complex with nuclear receptor corepressors leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the SIAH2 E3 ligase. Hyperthermia and arsenic therapy destabilize PML/RARalpha via distinct mechanisms and are synergistic in primary patient samples and in vivo, including three refractory APL cases. Collectively, our results suggest that by taking advantage of a biophysical vulnerability of PML/RARalpha, thermal therapy may improve prognosis in drug-resistant or otherwise refractory APL. These findings serve as a paradigm for therapeutic targeting of fusion oncoprotein-associated cancers by hyperthermia. Significance: Hyperthermia destabilizes oncofusion proteins including PML/RARalpha and acts synergistically with standard arsenic therapy in relapsed and refractory APL. The results open up the possibility that heat shock sensitivity may be an easily targetable vulnerability of oncofusion-driven cancers.See related commentary by Wu et al., p. 300.",['(c)2021 American

In this issue of Blood Cancer Discovery, Yun and colleagues provide evidence that MYC directly suppresses the expression of TFEB, an mTORC1-regulated transcription factor. They show that, in the context of the myelocytic/granulocytic lineage, TFEB acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing the IDH1/2-TET pathway, which in turn, leads to altered DNA methylation and increased expression of genes involved in myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore, high levels of MYC suppress an epigenetic pathway that should normally act to attenuate leukemic progression.

Despite an overall survival of 80% in the pediatric setting, 20% of patients with T-ALL ultimately die from relapsed or refractory disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapies. Molecular genetic analyses and sequencing studies have led to the identification of recurrent T-ALL genetic drivers. This review summarizes the main genetic drivers and targetable lesions of T-ALL and gives a comprehensive overview of the novel treatments for patients with T-ALL that are currently under clinical investigation or that are emerging from preclinical research.

Several SMO inhibitors are in clinical development for the treatment of various tumor types and the results from some clinical trials in AML have been reported. This review will discuss the role of Hh signaling in AML pathogenesis, describe the preclinical and clinical development of Hh pathway inhibitors for the treatment of AML, and examine the current evidence on Hh pathway inhibitor resistance and the implications for treatment selection in AML. Significance: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, such as Smoothened (SMO), have been implicated in the development, maintenance, and expansion of leukemic stem cells (LSC), as well as sensitization to chemotherapy and the development of drug resistance in AML. Observations in preclinical studies of AML, as well as from samples of patients with AML, demonstrate that Hh pathway inhibitors act primarily on the stem cell pathway as differentiation agents. The current data for hematologic malignancies indicate the potential for a synergistic effect when a Hh pathway inhibitor is administered in combination with chemotherapy or investigational agents. It is thought that Hh pathway inhibitors act as agents that reduce LSC dormancy and promote LSC differentiation, thus the newly dividing LSCs can then be targeted by other chemotherapeutic drugs.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Jamieson, Catriona', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Jamieson C', 'Martinelli G', 'Papayannidis C', 'Cortes JE']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center and Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center, La Jolla, California. cjamieson@AD.ucsd.edu.', 'Clinical and Research Leukemia Program, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST IRCCS), Meldola, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""L. and A.

Although chimeric fusion proteins involving transcription factors (TF) are hallmarks of many types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), therapeutically targeting the fusion proteins is a challenge. In this work, we characterize the core regulatory circuitry (CRC; interconnected autoregulatory loops of TFs) of B-ALL involving MEF2D-fusions and identify MEF2D-fusion and SREBF1 TFs as crucial CRC components. By gene silencing and pharmacologic perturbation, we reveal that the CRC integrates the pre-B-cell receptor (BCR) and lipid metabolism to maintain itself and govern malignant phenotypes. Small-molecule inhibitors of pre-BCR signaling and lipid biosynthesis disrupt the CRC and silence the MEF2D fusion in cell culture and show therapeutic efficacy in xenografted mice. Therefore, pharmacologic disruption of CRC presents a potential therapeutic strategy to target fusion protein-driven leukemia. Significance: Cancer type-specific gene expression is governed by transcription factors involved in a highly interconnected autoregulatory loop called CRC. Here, we characterized fusion protein-driven CRC and identified its pharmacologic vulnerabilities, opening therapeutic avenues to indirectly target fusion-driven leukemia by disrupting its CRC.See related commentary by Sadras and Muschen, p. 18.

BET proteins contain two bromodomains, a common protein motif that selectively binds acetylated lysine on histones. However, they are structurally distinct from other bromodomain-containing proteins because they encode a unique C-terminal extra-terminal (ET) domain that is important for the protein-protein interactions including jumonji C-domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase NSD3 (NSD3). Brd4 functions primarily during transcription as a passive scaffold linking cellular and viral proteins to chromatin. The rapid development of clinical inhibitors targeting Brd4 highlights the importance of this protein as an anticancer target. Current therapeutic approaches focus on the development of small molecule acetylated lysine mimics of histone marks that block the ability of the bromodomains to bind their chromatin marks. Thus far, bromodomain-targeted agents have shown dose-limiting toxicities due to off-target effects on other bromodomain-containing proteins. Here, we exploited a viral-host protein interaction interface to design peptides for the disruption of BET protein function. A murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrase-derived peptide (ET binding motif, EBM) and its shorter minimal binding motif (pentapeptide LKIRL) were sufficient to directly bind the Brd4 ET domain and reduce cellular proliferation of an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Using computational and biochemical approaches, we identified the minimal essential contacts between EBM and LKIRL peptides and the Brd4 ET domain. Our findings provide a structural foundation for inhibiting BET/Brd4-mediated cancers by targeting the ET domain with small peptide-based inhibitors.",['(c) 2021 American Chemical Society.'],"['Xing, Enming', 'Surendranathan, Nandini', 'Kong, Xiaotian', 'Cyberski, Natalie', 'Garcia, Jessica D', 'Cheng, Xiaolin', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Li, Pui-Kai', 'Larue, Ross C']","['Xing E', 'Surendranathan N', 'Kong X', 'Cyberski N', 'Garcia JD', 'Cheng X', 'Sharma A', 'Li PK', 'Larue RC']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, and Department of Microbial Infection & Immunity, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, College of Medicine, and Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210910,United States,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,ACS pharmacology & translational science,101721411,,,,2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 09:13'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2022/09/10 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/18 09:13 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsptsci.1c00159 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci. 2021 Sep 10;4(5):1628-1638. doi: 10.1021/acsptsci.1c00159. eCollection 2021 Oct 8.,4,5,1628-1638,,,PMC8506603,,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1421-3192', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7396-3225', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3836-5617', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0170-7345']",,,,['2022/09/10 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The GSE63157 and GSE17679 datasets contain patient and healthy control microarray data that were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed through R language software to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Firstly, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and Cytoscape Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in were then used to compute the highest scores of the module. After survival analysis, the hub genes were lastly obtained from the two module genes. Results: A total of 1181 DEGs were identified from the two GSEs. Through MCODE and survival analysis, we obtain 53 DEGs from the module and 29 overall survival- (OS-) related genes. ZBTB16 was the only downregulated gene after Venn diagrams. Survival analysis indicates that there was a significant correlation between the high expression of ZBTB16 and the OS of Ewing's sarcoma (ES), and the low expression group had an unfavorable OS when compared to the high expression group.

Besides severe cognitive impairment and intellectual disability, individuals with DS also exhibit additional phenotypes of variable penetrance and severity, with one or more comorbid conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, congenital heart disease, or leukemia. Various vital genes and regulatory networks had been studied to reveal the pathogenesis of the disease. Nevertheless, very few studies have examined alternative splicing. Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulatory mechanism of gene expression when making one multi-exon protein-coding gene produce more than one unique mature mRNA. We employed the GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) for the global gene analysis with hiPSCs from DS and healthy individuals. Examining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in these groups and focusing on specific transcripts with AS, 466 up-regulated and 722 down-regulated genes with AS events were identified. These genes were significantly enriched in biological processes, such as cell adhesion, cardiac muscle contraction, and immune response, through gene ontology (GO) analysis of DEGs. Candidate genes, such as FN1 were further explored for potentially playing a key role in DS.

However, 6-MP dose-related toxicities limit its application. TPMT, NUDT15, and ITPA are pharmacogenetic markers predicting 6-MP-related toxicities, but their genetic polymorphisms differ from those of ethnic populations. In Yunnan province, a multiethnic region of China, we had no genetic data to predict 6-MP toxicities. In this study, we evaluated the most common variants involved in 6-MP metabolism-TPMT (*)3C (rs1142345), NUDT15 c.415C>T (rs116855232), and ITPA c.94C>A (rs1127354) variants-in our cohort of pediatric ALL patients. Methods: A total of 149 pediatric ALL patients in the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Kunming Medical University (Yunnan Children's Medical Center) from 2017 to 2019 were enrolled in this retrospective study. We assessed the TPMT (*)3C (rs1142345), NUDT15 c.415C>T (rs116855232), and ITPA c.94C>A (rs1127354) frequencies and evaluated association between genotypes and 6-MP toxicities, 6-MP dose, and event-free survival (EFS) in these ALL patients. Results: The allele frequencies of TPMT (*)3C (rs1142345), NUDT15 c.415C>T (rs116855232), and ITPA c.94C>A (rs1127354) were 1.34%, 14.43%, and 18.79%, respectively. Only NUDT15 c.415C>T (rs116855232) was strongly associated with 6-MP toxicity and 6-MP tolerable dose. NUDT15 c.415C>T was related to leukopenia, p = 0.008, OR = 2.743 (95% CI: 1.305-5.768). The T allele was significantly correlated with 6-MP tolerable dose, dose of NUDT15 c.415C>T wild genotype CC 39.80 +/- 1.32 mg/m(2), heterozygotes CT 35.20 +/- 2.29 mg/m(2), and homozygotes TT 18.95 +/- 3.95 mg/m(2). 6-MP tolerable dose between CC and TT had a significant difference, p = 0.009.

In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), increased TIM-3 expression on TH1 cells, regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which play a role in the proliferation of blasts and induction of immune escape, has been reported. In AML, several studies have reported overexpression of TIM-3 on leukemia stem cells (LSCs) but not on healthy HSCs. Overexpression of TIM-3 on exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and leukemic cells in CML, ALL, and CLL patients could be a prognostic risk factor for poor therapeutic response and relapse in patients. Currently, several TIM-3 inhibitors are used in clinical trials for leukemias, and some have shown encouraging response rates for MDS and AML treatment. For AML immunotherapy, blockade TIM-3 may have dual effects: directly inhibiting AML cell proliferation and restoring T cell function. However, blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 fails to restore the function of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the early clinical stages of CLL, indicating that the effects of TIM-3 blockade may be different in AML and other leukemias. Thus, further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of TIM-3 inhibitors in different types and stages of leukemia. In this review, we summarize the biological functions of TIM-3 and its contribution as it relates to leukemias. We also discuss the effects of TIM-3 blockade in hematological malignancies and clinical trials of TIM-3 for leukemia therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Rezaei, Tan, Zeng, Li and Ganjalikhani-Hakemi.']","['Rezaei, Mahnaz', 'Tan, Jiaxiong', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'Ganjalikhani-Hakemi, Mazdak']","['Rezaei M', 'Tan J', 'Zeng C', 'Li Y', 'Ganjalikhani-Hakemi M']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210930,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['TIM-3', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 09:06'],"['2021/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 09:06 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.753677 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 30;11:753677. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.753677. eCollection 2021.,11,,753677,,,PMC8514831,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the moment treatment for CMML is largely restricted to the unspecific use of cytotoxic drugs and hypomethylating agents (HMA).

Recently, the higher attention to LGL clones led to their detection in many clinical conditions including myeloid neoplasms and bone marrow failures. In these contexts, it is still unclear whether LGL cells actively contribute to anti-stem cell autoimmunity or are only a reaction to dysplastic/leukemic myelopoiesis. Moreover, some evidence exists about a common clonal origin of LGL and myeloid clones, including the detection of STAT3 mutations, typical of LGL, in myeloid precursors from myelodysplastic patients. In this article we reviewed available literature regarding the association of LGL clones with myeloid neoplasms (myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute myeloid leukemias) and bone marrow failures (aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia, PRCA) focusing on evidence of pathogenic, clinical, and prognostic relevance. It emerged that LGL clones may be found in up to one third of patients, particularly those with PRCA, and are associated with a more cytopenic phenotype and good response to immunosuppression. Pathogenically, LGL clones seem to expand after myeloid therapies, whilst immunosuppression leading to LGL depletion may favor leukemic escape and thus requires caution.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Fattizzo, Bellani, Pasquale, Giannotta and Barcellini.']","['Fattizzo, Bruno', 'Bellani, Valentina', 'Pasquale, Raffaella', 'Giannotta, Juri Alessandro', 'Barcellini, Wilma']","['Fattizzo B', 'Bellani V', 'Pasquale R', 'Giannotta JA', 'Barcellini W']","['Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211001,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'aplastic anemia', 'large granular lymphocyte', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 09:06'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 09:06 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.748610 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 1;11:748610. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.748610. eCollection 2021.,11,,748610,,,PMC8517436,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extensive application of NGS in hematologic malignancies, and its significant association with the outcomes in multiple large cohorts constituted a proof of concept that AML phenotype is driven by underlying mutational signature and is amenable for targeted therapies. These findings urged incorporation of molecular results into the latest World Health Organization (WHO) sub-classification and integration into risk-stratification and treatment guidelines by the European Leukemia Net. NGS mutation profiling provides a large amount of information that guides diagnosis and management, dependent on the type and number of gene mutations, variant allele frequency and amenability to targeted therapeutics. Hence, molecular mutational profiling is an integral component for work-up of AML and multiple leukemic entities. In addition, there is a vast amount of informative data that can be obtained from routine clinical NGS sequencing beyond diagnosis, prognostication and therapeutic targeting. These include identification of evidence regarding the ontogeny of the disease, underlying germline predisposition and clonal hematopoiesis, serial monitoring to assess the effectiveness of therapy and resistance mutations, which have broader implications for management.

Several FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed in the last few years, but midostaurin is currently the only one approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients harboring FLT3 mutations. Here we describe for the first time a novel in-frame deletion in exon 14 (JM domain) of the FLT3 gene, that we identified in a young woman with CBFb-MYH11-positive AML. We demonstrated that this novel FLT3 variant is pathogenic, since it is responsible for constitutive activation of FLT3 receptor. Finally, ex-vivo studies demonstrated that this novel mutation is sensitive to midostaurin.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Bruno, Bandini, Patuelli, Robustelli, Venturi, Mancini, Forte,', 'De Santis, Monaldi, Grassi, Chiurumbolo, Paolini, Cristiano, Papayannidis,', 'Sartor, Nanni, Ottaviani, Curti, Cavo and Soverini.']","['Bruno, Samantha', 'Bandini, Lorenza', 'Patuelli, Agnese', 'Robustelli, Valentina', 'Venturi, Claudia', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Forte, Dorian', 'De Santis, Sara', 'Monaldi, Cecilia', 'Grassi, Alessandra', 'Chiurumbolo, Gabriella', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Cristiano, Gianluca', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Nanni, Jacopo', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Soverini, Simona']","['Bruno S', 'Bandini L', 'Patuelli A', 'Robustelli V', 'Venturi C', 'Mancini M', 'Forte D', 'De Santis S', 'Monaldi C', 'Grassi A', 'Chiurumbolo G', 'Paolini S', 'Cristiano G', 'Papayannidis C', 'Sartor C', 'Nanni J', 'Ottaviani E', 'Curti A', 'Cavo M', 'Soverini S']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210930,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3 mutation', 'NGS - next generation sequencing', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'midostaurin', 'targeted therapy']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 09:06'],"['2021/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 09:06 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.728613 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 30;11:728613. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.728613. eCollection 2021.,11,,728613,,,PMC8514815,,"['AC was employed by Novartis, Pfizer, Abbvie and acted as speaker in Advisory', 'Board for Novartis and Abbvie.

Hence, we aim to study the safety and effectiveness of low-dose, low-specific activity (LSA) (131)I-MIBG therapy in patients with symptomatic, metastatic PPGL. Methods: Clinical, hormonal, and radiological response parameters and side effects of LSA (131)I-MIBG therapy in patients with symptomatic, metastatic PPGL were retrospectively reviewed. World health organizations' (WHO) symptomatic, hormonal, and tumor response, and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST1.1) criteria were used to assess the response. Results: Seventeen (PCC: 11, sympathetic PGL: 06) patients (15 with disease progression) received low-dose LSA (131)I-MIBG therapy. Complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) were 18% (3/17), 24% (4/17), 18% (3/17), and 41% (7/17), respectively, for WHO symptomatic response; 20% (2/10), 10% (1/10), 30% (3/10), and 40% (4/10), respectively, for WHO hormonal response; and 19% (3/16), 6% (1/16), 31% (5/16), and 44% (7/16), respectively for tumor response based on RECIST1.1. All patients with symptomatic PD and 50% (2/4) with hormonal PD had progression as per RECIST1.1 criteria. Side effects included thrombocytopenia, acute myeloid leukemia, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and azoospermia in 6% (1/17) each. Conclusions: Our study reaffirms the modest efficacy and safety of low-dose, LSA (131)I-MIBG therapy in patients with symptomatic, metastatic PPGL. Symptomatic, but not hormonal, progression after (131)I-MIBG therapy correlates well with tumor progression and should be further evaluated with imaging. In resource-limited settings, anatomic imaging alone may be used to assess tumor response to (131)I-MIBG therapy.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.'],"['Barnabas, Rohit', 'Jaiswal, Sanjeet Kumar', 'Memon, Saba Samad', 'Sarathi, Vijaya', 'Malhotra, Gaurav', 'Verma, Priyanka', 'Patil, Virendra A', 'Lila, Anurag R', 'Shah, Nalini S', 'Bandgar, Tushar R']","['Barnabas R', 'Jaiswal SK', 'Memon SS', 'Sarathi V', 'Malhotra G', 'Verma P', 'Patil VA', 'Lila AR', 'Shah NS', 'Bandgar TR']","['Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Center, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Seth G.S Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210908,India,Indian J Endocrinol Metab,Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism,101555690,,['NOTNLM'],"['131I-MIBG', 'low-specific activity', 'paraganglioma', 'pheochromocytoma']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 09:06'],"['2021/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 09:06 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ijem.IJEM_52_21 [doi]', 'IJEM-25-148 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Endocrinol Metab. 2021 Mar-Apr;25(2):148-159. doi: 10.4103/ijem.IJEM_52_21.

In 2021, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has estimated 61,090 new cases of leukemia to occur within the United States. It has also been reported that the most common cause of death in children from one to fourteen years old is oncological, with leukemia being the most frequent cause. A phenomenon known as the Warburg effect has been affiliated with cancer. The Warburg effect is a metabolic abnormality of lactic acidosis in malignancies, with most cases presenting as hematological malignancies such as leukemia. Although many theories have been formulated to clarify the role of the Warburg effect, the exact role still remains uncertain. Four suggested theories on why the Warburg effect happens to include cell signaling, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, biosynthesis, and the tumor microenvironment. The Warburg effect occurs in leukemia with the help of enzymes such as pyruvate kinases M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). In this literature, we explain the proposed hypotheses of the Warburg effect, along with the molecular mechanism of how leukemia is able to produce lactic acid, with the intent to better understand this phenomenon.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Padda et al.']","['Padda, Jaskamal', 'Khalid, Khizer', 'Kakani, Varsha', 'Cooper, Ayden Charlene', 'Jean-Charles, Gutteridge']","['Padda J', 'Khalid K', 'Kakani V', 'Cooper AC', 'Jean-Charles G']","['Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, JC Medical Center, Orlando, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Advent Health & Orlando Health Hospital, Orlando, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210905,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['atp synthesis', 'lactic acidosis', 'leukemia', 'metabolic acidosis', 'warburg effect']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 09:03'],"['2021/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 09:03 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.17732 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Sep 5;13(9):e17732. doi: 10.7759/cureus.17732. eCollection 2021 Sep.,13,9,e17732,,,PMC8491631,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, BCR-ABL1 compound mutations may develop during therapy in these patients and may lead to drug resistance. Asciminib is a novel drug capable of targeting most BCR-ABL1 mutant-forms, including BCR-ABL1(T315I), but remains ineffective against most BCR-ABL1(T315I)+ compound mutation-bearing sub-clones. We demonstrate that asciminib synergizes with ponatinib in inducing growth-arrest and apoptosis in patient-derived CML cell lines and murine Ba/F3 cells harboring BCR-ABL1 (T315I) or T315I-including compound mutations. Asciminib and ponatinib also produced cooperative effects on CRKL phosphorylation in BCR-ABL1-transformed cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of the drug combination 'asciminib+ponatinib' was further enhanced by hydroxyurea (HU), a drug which has lately been described to suppresses the proliferation of BCR-ABL1 (T315I)+ CML cells. Cooperative drug effects were also observed in patient-derived CML cells. Most importantly, we were able to show that the combinations 'asciminib+ponatinib' and 'asciminib+ponatinib+HU' produce synergistic apoptosis-inducing effects in CD34(+)/CD38(-) CML stem cells obtained from patients with chronic phase CML or BCR-ABL1 (T315I)+ CML blast phase. Together, asciminib, ponatinib and HU synergize in producing anti-leukemic effects in multi-resistant CML cells, including cells harboring T315I+ BCR-ABL1 compound mutations and CML stem cells.

Missing data is the situation in which a part of research data has not been reported. This will result in the incompatibility of the sample and the population and misguided conclusions. Missing data is usual in research, and the extent of it will determine how misinterpreted the conclusions will be. All methods of parameter estimation and prediction models are based on the assumption that the data are complete. Extensive missing data will result in false predictions and increased bias. In the present study, a novel method has been proposed for the imputation of medical missing data. The method determines what algorithm is suitable for the imputation of missing data. To do so, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm was used. The algorithm imputes the missing data in a way that if a prediction model is applied to the data, both specificity and sensitivity will be optimized. Our proposed model was evaluated using real data of gastric cancer and acute T-cell leukemia (ATLL). First, the model was then used to impute the missing data. Then, the missing data were imputed using deletion, average, expectation maximization, MICE, and missForest methods. Finally, the prediction model was applied for both imputed datasets. The accuracy of the prediction model for the first and the second imputation methods was 0.5 and 16.5, respectively. The novel imputation method was more accurate than similar algorithms like expectation maximization and MICE.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Peyman Almasinejad et al.'],"['Almasinejad, Peyman', 'Golabpour, Amin', 'Mollakhalili Meybodi, Mohammad Reza', 'Mirzaie, Kamal', 'Khosravi, Ahmad']","['Almasinejad P', 'Golabpour A', 'Mollakhalili Meybodi MR', 'Mirzaie K', 'Khosravi A']","['Department of Computer Engineering, Maybod Branch, Islamic Azad University, Maybod, Iran.', 'Shahrood University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Maybod Branch, Islamic Azad University, Maybod, Iran.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Maybod Branch, Islamic Azad University, Maybod, Iran.', 'Center for Health Related Social and Behavioral Sciences Research, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,England,J Healthc Eng,Journal of healthcare engineering,101528166,IM,,,2021/10/19 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/10/18 08:59'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 08:59 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/1203726 [doi]'],epublish,J Healthc Eng. 2021 Oct 8;2021:1203726. doi: 10.1155/2021/1203726. eCollection 2021.,2021,,1203726,20211124,"['*Algorithms', '*Research Design']",PMC8519720,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6479-993X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7649-4033', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2475-5910', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7221-5030', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1106-3782']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the clinical success of venetoclax has been achieved in clinical outcomes such as complete remission (CR) and overall survival. Acquired resistance to ABT-199 which is induced by the regulation of apoptosis pathway is still an important clinical problem. To this end, the attempt to combine drugs which can reverse the compensatory regulation is urgent. Methods: In three AML cell lines (KG-1, Kasumi-1 and THP-1), the anti-AML effects of the combination of ABT-199 (Venetoclax) and metformin or the two drugs used alone were compared. CCK8 was used to evaluate the cell viability, and flow cytometry was used to estimate the rate of apoptosis, Western blot method was performed to detect apoptosis-related protein levels. In mice experiments, female BALB/c-nu nude mice were subcutaneously injected with THP-1 cells for subcutaneous tumor formation, and the combined effect of ABT-199 and metformin was tested. The evaluation indicators were tumor size, tumor weight, and Ki67 staining. Mouse body weight and HE staining were detected to evaluate liver damage and adverse drug reactions. Results: Both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that compared with metformin or ABT-199 alone, the combined use of the two drugs exerts a synergistic effect on promoting apoptosis, thereby producing a strong anti-leukemia effect. Furthermore, after a short incubation time, ABT-199 swiftly increased the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, while the combined use of metformin and ABT-199 significantly reduced the level of Mcl-1. Notably, Metformin significantly downregulates the level of Mcl-1 protein by inhibiting its protein production. To less extent, metformin can also downregulate the expression of another anti-apoptotic protein, BCL-xl. Conclusion: Metformin downregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl by inhibiting protein production, and shows a synergistic anti-tumor effect with ABT-199 in acute myeloid leukemia.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Zhou, Fang-Jiao', 'Zeng, Chen-Xing', 'Kuang, Wei', 'Cheng, Cong', 'Liu, Hong-Cai', 'Yan, Xue-Ying', 'Chen, Xiao-Ping', 'Zhou, Gan', 'Cao, Shan']","['Zhou FJ', 'Zeng CX', 'Kuang W', 'Cheng C', 'Liu HC', 'Yan XY', 'Chen XP', 'Zhou G', 'Cao S']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, PR China.', 'Phase I Clinical Trial Research Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, Hunan, P.R.

Recent studies confirmed that the hypoglycemic drug metformin (Met) exerted various antitumor effects, protected neural cells, and improved immunity, while arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the clinical treatment of leukemia and various solid tumors. However, the possible combined antitumor effects of Met and ATO and their cellular molecular mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the role of Parkin-mediated mitochondrial mitophagy in the anti-tumor mechanism of Met and ATO by studying the effects of Met and/or ATO on the proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer HeLa cells. Both Met and ATO effectively inhibited the proliferative activity of HeLa cells and induced apoptosis by activating Bax and inhibiting Bcl-2. Met and ATO treatment alone or in combination stimulated mitophagosome accumulation in HeLa cells, increased the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, and decreased levels of the mitophagic lysosomal substrate protein P62. The mitochondrial membrane potential of HeLa cells also decreased, accompanied by activation of the mitochondrial translocase TOM system and the Pink1/Parkin signaling pathway. These results suggested that Met and/or ATO could induce mitophagy in HeLa cells via the Pink1/Parkin signaling pathway, leading to mitophagic apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. The combination of Met and ATO thus has enhanced antitumor effects, suggesting that this combination has potential clinical applications for the treatment of cervical cancer and other tumors.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Chen, Jing', 'Zhou, Cunmin', 'Yi, Juan', 'Sun, Jingjing', 'Xie, Bei', 'Zhang, Zhewen', 'Wang, Qunfeng', 'Chen, Gang', 'Jin, Suya', 'Hou, Jinxia', 'Qin, Miao', 'Wang, Lina', 'Wei, Hulai']","['Chen J', 'Zhou C', 'Yi J', 'Sun J', 'Xie B', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang Q', 'Chen G', 'Jin S', 'Hou J', 'Qin M', 'Wang L', 'Wei H']","['Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The first hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The first hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210828,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'HeLa', 'Metformin', 'Mitophagy', 'Pink1/Parkin']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 08:57'],"['2021/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 08:57 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.61299 [doi]', 'jcav12p6310 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2021 Aug 28;12(21):6310-6319. doi: 10.7150/jca.61299. eCollection 2021.,12,21,6310-6319,,,PMC8489132,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lot of effort has been made to improve the prognosis of AML. However, the situation remains serious. Hence, we focused on the study of prognostic genes in AML. Materials and Methods: Prognostic oxidative stress genes were screened out. The gene expression profile of AML patients was downloaded from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The oxidative stress-related model was constructed, by which the prognosis of AML patients was predicted using the two GEO GSE23143 datasets and the stability of the GSE71014 authentication model. Results: The prognostic oxidative stress genes were screened out in AML, and the prognostic genes were significantly enriched in a large number of pathways based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. There was a complex interaction between prognostic genes and transcription factors. After constructing the prediction model, the clinical predictive value of the model was discussed in a multi-omic study. We investigated the sensitivity of risk score to common chemotherapeutic agents, the influence of signaling pathways on the prognosis of AML patients, and the correlation of multiple genes with immune score and immune dysfunction. Conclusions: A highly effective prognostic risk model for AML patients was established and validated. The association of prognostic oxidative stress genes with drug sensitivity, signaling pathways, and immune infiltration was explored. The results suggested that oxidative stress genes promised to be potential prognostic biomarkers for AML, which may provide a new basis for disease management.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Dong, Zhang and Zhang.']","['Dong, Chao', 'Zhang, Naijin', 'Zhang, Lijun']","['Dong C', 'Zhang N', 'Zhang L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210930,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunitary', 'multi-omics', 'oxidative stress', 'prognosis']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:01,['2021/10/18 08:55'],"['2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 08:55 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.722064 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Sep 30;12:722064. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.722064. eCollection 2021.,12,,722064,,,PMC8514868,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autoimmunity and immunodeficiency are the two faces of a dysregulated immune tolerance and surveillance and may result, along with contributing environmental and genetic factors, in an increased incidence of both tumors and infections. The latter may fuel both autoimmunity and immune activation, triggering a vicious circle among infections, tumors and autoimmune phenomena. Additionally, alterations of the microbiota and of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) pinpoint to the importance of a permissive or hostile microenvironment for tumor growth. Finally, several therapies of myeloid neoplasms are aimed at increasing host immunity against the tumor, but at the price of increased autoimmune phenomena. In this review we will examine the epidemiological association of myeloid neoplasms with autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies, and the pivotal role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of MDS and BMF syndromes, including the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria conundrum.

To cross such barriers, Johns Hopkins platform consisting of haploBMT followed by post-transplantation (PT) cyclophosphamide (Cy) has been used. Although the central mechanism of the Johns Hopkins regimen is Cy-induced tolerance with bone marrow cells (BMC) followed by Cy on days 3 and 4, the mechanisms of Cy-induced tolerance may not be well understood. Here, I review our studies in pursuing skin-tolerance from minor histocompatibility (H) antigen disparity to xenogeneic antigen disparity through fully allogeneic antigen disparity. To overcome fully allogeneic antigen barriers or xenogeneic barriers for skin grafting, pretreatment of the recipients with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against T cells before cell injection was required. In the cells-followed-by-Cy system providing successful skin tolerance, five mechanisms were identified using the correlation between super-antigens and T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta segments mainly in the H-2-identical murine combinations. Those consist of: 1) clonal destruction of antigen-stimulated-thus-proliferating mature T cells with Cy; 2) peripheral clonal deletion associated with immediate peripheral chimerism; 3) intrathymic clonal deletion associated with intrathymic chimerism; 4) delayed generation of suppressor T (Ts) cells; and 5) delayed generation of clonal anergy. These five mechanisms are insufficient to induce tolerance when the donor-recipient combinations are disparate in MHC antigens plus minor H antigens as is seen in haploBMT. Clonal destruction is incomplete when the antigenic disparity is too strong to establish intrathymic mixed chimerism. Although this incomplete clonal destruction leaves the less-proliferative, antigen-stimulated T cells behind, these cells may confer graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects after haploBMT/PTCy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Mayumi.'],"['Mayumi, Hisanori']",['Mayumi H'],"['Mayumi GP & Cardiology Clinic, Saitama City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210929,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*PTCY', '*PTCy-haplo HSCT', '*clonal deletion', '*clonal destruction', '*cyclophosphamide-induced tolerance', '*drug-induced tolerance', '*haploBMT', '*haploBMT/PTCy']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/10/18 08:55'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/18 08:55 [entrez]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.744430 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Sep 29;12:744430. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.744430. eCollection 2021.,12,,744430,20211217,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Heterografts', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Transplantation Tolerance/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/*methods']",PMC8513786,,"['The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to establish a risk-scoring model to predict HD-MTX-induced liver injury, considering gene polymorphisms' effects. Data screening was performed through t-test, chi-square test, and ridge regression, and six predictors were identified: age, MTRR_AA, MTRR_AG, SLCO1B1_11045879_CC, albumin_1 day before MTX administration, and IBIL_1 day before MTX administration (p < 0.1). Then, the risk-scoring model was established by ridge regression and evaluated the prediction performance. In a training cohort (n = 49), the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.76, and metrics including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were promising (0.86, 0.81, 0.76, 0.91, 0.81, 0.88, respectively). In a test cohort (n = 21), the AUC was 0.62 and negative predictive value was 0.80; other evaluation metrics were not satisfactory, possibly due to the limited sample size. Ultimately, the risk scores were stratified into three groups based on their distributions: low- (</=48), medium- (49-89), and high-risk (>89) groups.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of interleukins-6 (IL-6) and IL-18 in patients with AML and its correlation with response to therapy and graft versus host disease (GvHD) after bone marrow transplantation. The expression levels of IL-6 and IL-18 genes were done in all patients and compared with matched control. Complete remission (CR) was used for evaluation of the effects of these cytokines on response to treatment in patients group. The expression level of these cytokines was also evaluated in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation and experienced acute GvHD in compare with patients without aGvHD. Il-6 gene expression level was significantly higher in these patients in comparison with control but Il-18 gene expression level was not statistically significant compared to control group. Il-6 and also Il-18 expression levels were significantly higher in patients without a response to treatment according to CR compared to patient's whit response to treatment as well as patients experienced aGvHD after bone marrow transplantation. IL-6 and Il-18 are important markers in the progression of the disease and could be considered as a prognostic marker in acute leukemia.

Germline mutations now account for almost 10% of adult and paediatric myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML). As our ability to diagnose HHMSs has improved, we are now faced with the challenges of integrating these advances into routine clinical practice for patients with MDS/AML and how to optimise management and surveillance of patients and asymptomatic carriers. Discoveries of novel syndromes combined with clinical, genetic and epigenetic profiling of tumour samples, have highlighted unique patterns of disease evolution across HHMSs. Despite these advances, causative lesions are detected in less than half of familial cases and evidence-based guidelines are often lacking, suggesting there is much still to learn.

This approach is advantageous over de novo drug discovery in accelerating clinical development, in terms of lower costs, a shortened development period, a well-known action mechanism, a feasible dosage, and an acceptable safety profile. AREAS COVERED: This work was aimed at reviewing agents with successful DR in hematology. EXPERT OPINION: Thalidomide and plerixafor have been successfully repositioned for treating multiple myeloma and harvesting peripheral blood stem cells, respectively. The former was originally developed as a sedative and the latter as an anti-HIV drug. Currently, the feasibility of repositioning various agents is being explored (e.g. an anti-influenza virus drug oseltamivir for primary immune thrombocytopenia, an anti-HIV drug abacavir for adult T-cell leukemia, and a macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for multiple myeloma). Furthermore, bosutinib for chronic myeloid leukemia or the antiplatelet drug cilostazol have been suggested to have clinical benefits for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ischemic stroke, respectively. To promote DR, effective application of artificial intelligence or stem cell models, comprehensive database construction shared between academia and pharmaceutical companies, suitable handling of drug patents, and wide cooperation in the area of specialty are warranted.",,"['Ohmoto, Akihiro', 'Fuji, Shigeo']","['Ohmoto A', 'Fuji S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211102,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug repositioning', 'artificial intelligence', 'drug reprofiling', 'stem cell model', 'thalidomide']",2021/10/19 06:00,2021/10/19 06:00,['2021/10/18 05:23'],"['2021/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/18 05:23 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2021.1995348 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Nov;14(11):1005-1011. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2021.1995348.

We assessed the prognostic impact of established chromosomal abnormalities and key copy number alterations (CNA) among 652 patients with B-cell precursor ALL treated on a modern MRD driven protocol. Patients with KMT2A-AFF1, complex karyotype (CK) and low hypodiploidy/near-triploidy (HoTr) had high relapse rates 50%, 60% & 53% and correspondingly poor survival. Patients with BCR-ABL1 had an outcome similar to other patients. JAK-STAT abnormalities (CRLF2, JAK2) occurred in 6% patients and were associated with a high relapse rate (56%). Patients with ABL-class fusions were rare (1%). A small group of patients with ZNF384 fusions (n = 12) had very good survival. CNA affecting IKZF1, CDKN2A/B, PAX5, BTG1, ETV6, EBF1, RB1 and PAR1 were assessed in 436 patients. None of the individual deletions or profiles were associated with survival, either in the cohort overall or within key subgroups. Collectively these data indicate that primary genetic abnormalities are stronger prognostic markers than secondary deletions. We propose a revised UKALL genetic risk classification based on key established chromosomal abnormalities: (1) very high risk: CK, HoTr or JAK-STAT abnormalities; (2) high risk: KMT2A fusions; (3) Tyrosine kinase activating: BCR-ABL1 and ABL-class fusions; (4) standard risk: all other patients.",['(c) 2021.

The cytotoxicity of these analogs toward different cancer cell lines was investigated in vitro. The new TD compounds showed potent inhibitory activities toward prostate cancer (PC3), leukemia (K562), breast cancer (MDA-231), lung cancer (A549), and cervical cancer (Hela) cell lines. Among them, TD1, TD11, and TD17 showed excellent broad-spectrum cytotoxic effects on five cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle phase.

The recent availability of novel targeted therapies, namely Bruton's tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, and BCL-2 inhibitors, have revolutionized the treatment algorithm for CLL but have not yet resulted in cure. Advances in the field of immuno-oncology and T cell engineering brought chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy from the laboratory to the clinic for treatment of B cell lymphoid malignancies and has improved the disease response and survival outcomes of various types of relapsed and/or refractory B cell lymphomas. While acknowledging that there are no approved CAR T cell therapies for CLL at this time, in this comprehensive review we explore novel targets for CAR T cell therapy in CLL and highlight the promising results of CAR T cell trials reported to date. Furthermore, we shed light on future areas of development, including multitarget CAR T cell products for this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

MAIN METHODS: Sixty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control group, psychological stress group, high ambient temperature group, and high ambient temperature combined with psychological stress group. All treatments were administered for two weeks. During this period, the estrous cycle, body weights and rectal temperature were measured regularly. Then, ovarian weight coefficient, serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) concentration, uterine histomorphological alterations, levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the expressions of ovarian hormone receptors, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its receptor, homeobox gene A10 (HoxA10), Wnt5a, Wnt7a, beta-catenin, and P-beta-catenin(Y142) in the uterus and endometrium were detected. KEY FINDINGS: High temperature combined with psychological stress lead to body weight, body temperature, ovarian hormones and estrus cycle disorder, uterine gland ducts expansion and endometrial thickness reduction, and the decreased expression of endometrial receptivity markers (LIF and HoxA10). Further, disturbed expression of E2 and P receptors in endometrium, elevated MDA and TNF-alpha levels, and decreased Wnt5a, Wnt7a and P-beta-catenin(Y142) content were found. Our data suggested that co-exposure to high temperature and psychological stress could aggravate uterine damage probably by inducing ovarian hormonal disorder and the subsequent oxidative stress and inflammation, and reduce the endometrial function through suppressing Wnt signaling.

The aim of the study is to study, with the French sociocultural specificities, the first professional integration of these young people. METHODS: A sequential quantitative-qualitative mixed approach associates 16 individual interviews and responses to a self-questionnaire of 254 young cancer survivors (sex-ratio=1, median age 23.5 years diagnosed between 2000 and 2010; 68% leukemia) to 30 individual and collective interviews of professionals. Results They seem to have had fewer difficulties than the general population to find their first job (33% vs. 44%). Young women had more difficulties, young people thought they had stopped studying too early and those who mentioned their sequelae (mainly psychological and neurocognitive). The qualitative phase shows that, in this context, the information provided during the job interview plays an important role in access to the first job. DISCUSSION: The study showed a need for information, communication and training for all actors whose main axes could be: i) for young people: learn to introduce themselves and adapt speeches and postures, be aware of their non-obligation to reveal a situation relating to health and to the handicap; ii) for the medical profession: to promote communication and to find spaces for exchanges between specialists, generalists, occupational physicians; iii) for employers: better know the disease and the laws to adapt their eyes and practices.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

TET1 recognizes and binds to regions of high genomic 5'-CpG-3' dinucleotide density, such as CpG islands, initiates the DNA demethylation program, and maintains DNA methylation and demethylation balance to maintain genomic methylation homeostasis and achieve epigenetic regulation. This article reviews the recent research progress of TET1 in the mechanism of demethylation, stem cells and immunity, various malignant tumours and other clinical diseases. CONCLUSION: TET1 acts as a key factor mediating demethylation, the mechanism of which still remains to be investigated in detail. TET1 is also critical in maintaining the differentiation pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and plays anti- or oncogenic roles in combination with different signalling pathways in different tumours. In certain tumours, its role is still controversial. In addition, the noncatalytic activity of TET1 has gradually attracted attention and has become a new direction of research in recent years.",['(c) 2021.

Previous studies indicated that TRIM14 played a tumorigenic role in various types of cancer and miR-23b-5p was down-regulated in human mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (HMSC-exos) of AML patients. However, their roles in AML remains unclear. Our study aims to investigate the role of TRIM14 and miR-23b-5p in the pathogenesis of AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The blood specimen was collected from de novo AML patients and healthy donators. Exosomes were extracted from the culture medium of human mesenchymal stem cells under ultracentrifugation. Then exosomes were co-cultured with AML cells to determine the effect of their contents. The cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 assay, whereas the cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of miR-23b-5p and TRIM14 was silenced or overexpressed to explore their biological functions in AML. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to validate the interaction between miR-23b-5p and TRIM14. Gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblots. RESULTS: TRIM14 was significantly increased in AML patients and cell lines. The inhibition of TRIM14 significantly reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of AML cells via activating PI3K/AKT pathway, whereas its overexpression exhibited reversed effects. HMSC-exos could suppress the proliferation of AML cells through the delivery of miR-23b-5p. Moreover, miR-23b-5p inhibited the transcription of TRIM14 by binding on its 3'UTR region. Overexpression of TRIM14 exhibited reversed effect against the function of miR-23b-5p mimic. CONCLUSION: TRIM14 could promote the proliferation of AML cells via activating PI3K/AKT pathway, which was reversed by HMSC-exos through delivering miR-23b-5p. These findings indicated that miR-23b-5p and TRIM14 could be applied as potential targets for the treatment of AML.",['(c) 2021.

The chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate (MTX) is used to treat most ALL patients and is closely associated with cognitive deficits. To address how early life cancer chemotherapy leads to cognitive deficits, we developed a translationally relevant mouse model of leukemia survival that exposed mice to leukemic cells and chemotherapeutic drugs (vincristine and MTX, with leucovorin rescue) in early life. Male and female mice were tested several weeks later using novel object recognition (recognition memory) and 5-choice serial reaction time task (executive function). Gene expression of proinflammatory, white matter and synapse-associated molecules was assessed in the prefrontal cortex and small intestine both acutely after chemotherapy and chronically after cognitive testing. Early life cancer-chemotherapy exposure resulted in recognition memory and executive function deficits in adult male mice. Prefrontal cortex expression of the chemokine Ccl2 was increased acutely, while small intestine expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha was elevated both acutely (both sexes) and chronically (males only). Inflammation in the small intestine was correlated with prefrontal cortical proinflammatory and synaptic gene expression changes, as well as to executive function deficits. Collectively, these data indicate that the current protocol results in a robust mouse model in which to study cognitive deficits in leukemia survivors, and suggest that small intestine inflammation may represent a novel contributor to adverse CNS consequences of early life chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Glucose is the most consumed nutrient by cancer cells and metabolized to lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon is called 'aerobic glycolysis'. Also, glucose level is found lower in tumor environment. Leukemia is characterized by abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic cells. STAT3 a transcription factor and an oncogene is upregulated in many tumor types. Despite its well-defined functions, STAT3 has also been proposed as a metabolic regulator. In this study, we aimed to determine the role STAT3 activation in glucose limitation, in leukemia cell lines. K562, NB-4 and HL-60 cells were found sensitive to glucose limitation. In low glucose conditions, total and nuclear STAT3 protein was decreased in all cells. In mitochondria, S727 phosphorylated STAT3 (mitochondrial form) was determined slightly increased in K562 and NB-4 cells. On the other side, ectopically STAT3 expressing cells had increased glucose consumption and less proliferated in low glucose medium. This data suggests that aerobic glycolysis might be upregulated upon STAT3 expression in leukemia cells, in glucose limitation. Furthermore, in this study, it was found that GLUT3 expressing cells did not reduce STAT3 expression in low glucose medium. GLUT3 was previously determined as a molecular marker for cell sensitivity to glucose limitation, therefore, it could be hypothesized as GLUT3 expressing cells might not need to alter STAT3 expression in low glucose level. Overall, our data suggest that leukemia cells rewire glucose metabolism via STAT3 expression in glucose limitation. Elucidating pathways that cause differential phosphorylation of STAT3 and its interaction with other energy regulating pathways in cellular response to glucose limitation might be beneficial to design new drug targets such as STAT3 inhibitors for leukemia treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the overall survival rate remains particularly disappointing due to a high rate of chemotherapy resistance and relapse. The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) is a novel promising therapeutic target of AML and has been indicated to be strongly correlated with chemotherapy resistance and relapse driven by leukemic stem cells. Nevertheless, the CALCRL downstream genes associated with the drug resistance and relapse of AML remain to be elucidated. Within this study, we used multiple gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and cBioPortal to explore the candidate CALCRL-associated genes that could potentially mediate the chemoresistance and relapse of AML. Then, we investigated the prognostic value, coexpression relationship with CALCRL, and expression characteristics of these genes using independent data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Eventually, three genes were screened out as CALCRL-associated prognostic genes. The expression of AGTPBP1 and LYST was negatively correlated with CALCRL, high expression of which was associated with favorable prognosis in AML. In contrast, the expression of ETS2 was positively correlated with CALCRL, high expression of which was associated with poor prognosis in AML. The results indicated that the three prognostic genes are potential CALCRL downstream genes that mediate drug resistance and relapse in AML.

Recently, several studies have shown that the use of recombinant vectors engineered to express fusion proteins is becoming attractive for the development of enhanced oncolytic viruses. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of four different FAST proteins (p10 FAST of Avian reovirus [ARV], p10 FAST of Pulau virus [PuV], p13 FAST of Broome virus [BroV], and p14 FAST of reptilian reovirus [RRV]). Plasmids encoding FASTs were transfected into Vero cells. All FAST proteins induced syncytium formation at varying intensities. To achieve high levels of FAST expression, four different FAST genes were inserted into the murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vector. Two days after transfection in 293 T cells, only the MoMLV-10A1-p10(PuV) RCR vector showed syncytia formation. Based on these results, p10(Puv) was selected from the four FASTs. Next, we investigated the cytotoxicity of p10(PuV) on HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and U87 human glioma cells. Although three human cancer cell lines induced syncytium formation, U87 cells were highly susceptible to syncytia formation by transfection with p10(PuV). In addition, the viral supernatants from MoMLV-10A-p10(PuV) RCR vector-transfected 293 T cells also induced syncytium formation in HT1080, TE671, and U87 cells.

Although PI3K inhibitors have been used in clinics for follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, no agents targeting PI3K aberrations in lung cancer have been approved by the FDA so far. In this study, we observed that PIK3CA-E545K, the most common mutation in lung cancer, harbored a modest induction of stem-like properties in lung epithelial cells, and drove development of adenocarcinoma autochthonously when paired with p53 loss in a murine mouse model. We also found that PIK3CA-mutant of amplified lung cancer cells were sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. EZH2 inhibition synergized with PI3K inhibition in human cancer cells in vitro and worked together efficiently in vivo. Mechanistically, EZH2 inhibition cooperated with PI3K inhibition to produce a more potent suppression of phospho-AKT downstream of PI3K. This study suggests a promising combination therapy to combat lung cancers with PIK3CA mutation or amplification.

Overexpression of PBX1, a proto-oncogene, is correlated with the progression and metastasis of various cancers. For the first time, in this study the researchers evaluated the relationship between rs6426881, affecting miR-522-3p binding to the PBX1, with breast and gastric cancers. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Microarray analysis was performed for finding the relative expression level of PBX1 and hsa-miR-522-3p, based on high throughput experiments. The GSE54397, GSE112369, GSE10810, GSE241585.ER, GSE24185.PR, GSE68373, and GSE38167 datasets were analyzed. A case-control study was carried out in 123 Iranian suffering from breast cancer and 132 participants as control samples as well as 130 people suffering from gastric cancer and 54 people as control group members. SNP rs6426881 in the 3'-UTR of PBX1 was genotyped by the High-Resolution Melting (HRM) method. Association analysis revealed that rs6426881 is correlated with Estrogen and Progesterone receptors, grade, and stage of breast cancer. Furthermore, a significant relationship was observed between the genotypes and blood groups in gastric cancer, while the distribution of alleles was significantly related to smoking, status of the primary tumor, and metastasis (Chi-Square P < 0.05). Finally, Bioinformatics analyses suggested that rs6426881 contains binding sites for miR-522-3p in the 3'-UTR of PBX1 transcript. The finding suggested that TT genotype is associated with poor prognosis in breast and gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The rs6426881 T allele at PBX1 3'-UT is significantly related to breast and gastric cancers by altering the regulatory affinity of miR-522-3p to PBX1 3'-UTR and may be suggested as a novel prognostic biomarker for the diseases.","['(c) 2021.

Reduced expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs leads to cancer cell development, so restoring the expression of these miRNAs can be an appropriate treatment option for cancer. Due to the heterogeneity of cancer cells, single-drug therapy often results in drug resistance. Therefore, the combination of chemotherapy with miRNA can be a powerful strategy for cancer treatment. In the current investigation, miR-34a mimic, and negative control were purchased and transfected using jetPEI reagents. Then the synergic effects of miR-34a in combination with doxorubicin were investigated on cell death of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cell line, as well as the expression of some genes including Caspase-3, Bcl-2, and p53 which are involved in apoptosis. Our outcomes showed that this combination remarkably reduced the expression of the Bcl-2 gene, the target gene of miR-34a. According to the results of the MTT assay, the survival rate was significantly decreased compared to the untreated cells. Results of the flow cytometry assay and DAPI staining demonstrated an increased apoptosis rate of Jurkat cells in combination therapy. Moreover, cell cycle arrest was observed at the G2/M phase in cells that were treated with miR-34a/doxorubicin. Most importantly, we showed that the transfection of the Jurkat cells with miR-34a increased the sensitivity of these cells to doxorubicin. Furthermore, the combination of miR-34a and doxorubicin drug effectively increased apoptosis of treated cells. Therefore, this method can be used as an impressive treatment for T-ALL.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to detect the serum IL-10 levels in ALL patients before and during chemotherapy. Patients were divided into either complete remission (CR) group and non-remission (NR) group, before chemotherapy group and during chemotherapy group, B-ALL group and T-ALL group, WT-1 positive group and BCR-ABL1 positive group. The changes in serum IL-10 concentration before and during the chemotherapy were analyzed. RESULTS: IL-10 serum levels were significantly elevated in ALL patients at the onset of disease, and it was also more elevated in the NR group compared to the CR group. There is a significant reduction in IL-10 serum levels in ALL patients after effective chemotherapy. There was no significant difference between the before chemotherapy group and during chemotherapy group. Regardless of chemotherapy, the IL-10 levels of patients whose bone marrow achieved complete remission were lower than the patients who have not (p < 0.05). The same result can be seen in B or T-ALL groups. There was no significant difference in IL-10 serum levels between the group with WT-1(+) or BCR-ABL1(+) and the group with WT-1(-) or BCR-ABL1(-) (p > 0.05). In some ALL patients, increased IL-10 concentrations may be correlated to the number of peripheral blood leukemic cells.

RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we describe the access to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monitoring in different countries of South America. We also address the ongoing discontinuation trials, the progress, and limitations of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the last years. There are still many challenges for achieving the best outcomes for CML patients in South America. The continuous efforts to provide continuous education, access to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and monitoring, providing reference centers for CML management and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may improve patients' outcomes.","['(c) 2021.

Treatment options for hypereosinophilia remain limited despite recent approaches including IL-5-targeted monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: To understand aberrant survival patterns and options for pharmacologic intervention, we characterized BCL-2-regulated apoptosis signaling by testing for BCL-2 family expression levels as well as pharmacologic inhibition using primary patient samples from diverse subtypes of hypereosinophilia (hypereosinophilic syndrome n = 18, chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified n = 9, lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia n = 2, myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia n = 2, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis n = 11, reactive eosinophilia n = 3). RESULTS: Contrary to published literature, we found no difference in the levels of the lncRNA Morrbid and its target BIM. Yet, we identified a near complete loss of expression of pro-apoptotic PUMA as well as a reduction in anti-apoptotic BCL-2. Accordingly, BCL-2 inhibition using venetoclax failed to achieve cell death induction in eosinophil granulocytes and bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with hypereosinophilia. In contrast, MCL1 inhibition using S63845 specifically decreased the viability of bone marrow progenitor cells in patients with hypereosinophilia. In patients diagnosed with Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia (CEL-NOS) or Myeloid and Lymphatic Neoplasia with hypereosinophilia (MLN-Eo) repression of survival was specifically powerful. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that MCL1 inhibition might be a promising therapeutic option for hypereosinophilia patients specifically for CEL-NOS and MLN-Eo.",['(c) 2021.

Although little is known about the etiology of MM, several metabolic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, poor nutrition, many of which are modifiable, have been linked to the pathogenesis of numerous neoplasms including MM. In this article, we provide a detailed summary of what is known about the impact of obesity on the pathogenesis of MM, its influence on outcomes in MM patients, and discuss potential mechanisms through which obesity is postulated to influence MM risk and prognosis. Along with advancements in treatment modalities to improve survival in MM patients, focused efforts are needed to prevent or intercept MM at its earliest stages. The consolidated findings presented in this review highlight the need for clinical trials to assess if lifestyle modifications can reduce the incidence and improve outcomes of MM in high-risk populations. Data generated from such studies can help formulate evidence-based lifestyle recommendations for the prevention and control of MM.","['(c) 2021.

This study aimed to investigate the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevention policies on the incidence and etiology of febrile neutropenia (FN) episodes in children with acute leukemia. Children who had acute leukemia and were diagnosed as FN in a tertiary center from March 2018 to March 2021 were included in the study. FN episodes were grouped as prepandemic and postpandemic based on the date that pandemic was declared. Relevant data were collected retrospectively. We evaluated 113 FN episodes (75.2% were prepandemic) of 46 patients, aged a median of 4.7 (2.6 to 12.6) years. The number of FN episodes per patient did not differ between prepandemic and postpandemic periods (P=0.476). There was no significant difference among the 2 groups regarding the microbiologic causes, focus of fever, and clinical outcomes in FN episodes. Two of the patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 and recovered without any complications. In conclusion, we showed that the incidence and etiology of FN episodes were similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in children with acute leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Tumor cells lacking LKB1 display an aggressive phenotype, with uncontrolled cell growth and higher energetic and redox stress due to its failure to balance ATP and NADPH levels in response to cellular stimulus. The identification of effective therapeutic regimens for patients with LKB1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a major clinical need. Here, we report that LKB1-deficient NSCLC tumor cells displayed reduced basal levels of ATP and to a lesser extent other nucleotides, and markedly enhanced sensitivity to 8-Cl-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado), an energy-depleting nucleoside analog. Treatment with 8-Cl-Ado depleted intracellular ATP levels, raised redox stress, and induced cell death leading to a compensatory suppression of mTOR signaling in LKB1-intact, but not LKB1-deficient, cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that the MAPK/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways were activated in response to 8-Cl-Ado treatment and targeting these pathways enhanced the antitumor efficacy of 8-Cl-Ado. IMPLICATIONS: Together, our findings demonstrate that LKB1-deficient tumor cells are selectively sensitive to 8-Cl-Ado and suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting vulnerable energy stores combined with signaling pathway inhibitors merit further investigation for this patient population.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Galan-Cobo, Ana', 'Stellrecht, Christine M', 'Yilmaz, Emrullah', 'Yang, Chao', 'Qian, Yu', 'Qu, Xiao', 'Akhter, Ishita', 'Ayres, Mary L', 'Fan, Youhong', 'Tong, Pan', 'Diao, Lixia', 'Ding, Jie', 'Giri, Uma', 'Gudikote, Jayanthi', 'Nilsson, Monique', 'Wierda, William G', 'Wang, Jing', 'Skoulidis, Ferdinandos', 'Minna, John D', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Heymach, John V']","['Galan-Cobo A', 'Stellrecht CM', 'Yilmaz E', 'Yang C', 'Qian Y', 'Qu X', 'Akhter I', 'Ayres ML', 'Fan Y', 'Tong P', 'Diao L', 'Ding J', 'Giri U', 'Gudikote J', 'Nilsson M', 'Wierda WG', 'Wang J', 'Skoulidis F', 'Minna JD', 'Gandhi V', 'Heymach JV']","['Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UT Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UT Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Institute of Oncology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, P.R.

Chemo(immuno)therapies (CIT) have traditionally aimed to reduce tumor burden without fully understanding their effects on the immune system. As a consequence, CIT are usually associated with higher risk of infections, secondary neoplasms and autoimmune disorders. A better understanding of the biology of the disease has led to the development of therapeutic strategies which not only act against malignant B-cells but also reactivate and enhance the patient's own anti-tumor immune response. Here, we review the current understanding of the underlying interplay between the malignant cells and non-malignant immune cells that may promote tumor survival and proliferation. In addition, we review the available evidence on how different treatment options for CLL including CIT regimens, small molecular inhibitors (i.e, BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors) and T-cell therapies, affect the immune system and their clinical consequences. Finally, we propose that a dual therapeutic approach, acting directly against malignant B-cells and restoring the immune function is clinically relevant and should be considered when developing future strategies to treat patients with CLL.",['(c) 2021.

Diagnosis by traditional means is easy to be confused with other similar species. Here, we report a case of oral myiasis, in a 5-month-old infant who was diagnosed by morphological examination and molecular biological methods. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-month old infant with acute myeloid leukemia was admitted due to recurrent skin masses for more than 4 months. The infant had lip swelling, which prevented him from closing the mouth and membranes were present in his mouth and there were also oral ulcers and erosions. Ten maggots were found in the mouth and one in the ear canal with pus flowing out and were confirmed as the third stage larvae of Sarcophaga ruficornis by morphological examination and a comparison of sequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) gene. After removal of the maggots and chemotherapy, the infant 's condition was gradually improved. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our our knowledge, this is the first neonatal oral myiasis case reported in China and its diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Microscopy combined with specific DNA sequence analysis is an effective technological tool to provide rapid diagnoses of the larva specimen and cases of rare diseases, as illustrated in the current case.",['(c) 2021.

Based on previous work that endothelial cell dysfunction is present in aGVHD and that epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) plays a significant role in decreasing inflammation by repressing endothelial cell activation and T cell migration, we hypothesized that increasing EGFL7 levels after allo-HSCT will diminish the severity of aGVHD. Here, we show that treatment with recombinant EGFL7 (rEGFL7) in two different murine models of aGVHD decreases aGVHD severity and improves survival in recipient mice after allogeneic transplantation with respect to controls without affecting graft versus leukemia effect. Furthermore, we showed that rEGFL7 treatment results in higher thymocytes, T, B and dendritic cells in recipient mice after allo-HSCT.

Their enzymatic activities are of particular significance as putative therapeutic targets in leukemia. In contrast, less is known about the contextual role in which those enzymatic activities are exercised and specifically how different macromolecular complexes configure the same enzymatic activity with distinct molecular and cellular consequences. We focus on KAT2A, a lysine acetyltransferase responsible for histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation, which we recently identified as a dependence in acute myeloid leukemia stem cells and that participates in 2 distinct macromolecular complexes: Ada two-A-containing (ATAC) and Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA). Through analysis of human cord blood hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, and of myeloid leukemia cells, we identify unique respective contributions of the ATAC complex to regulation of biosynthetic activity in undifferentiated self-renewing cells and of the SAGA complex to stabilization or correct progression of cell type-specific programs with putative preservation of cell identity. Cell type and stage-specific dependencies on ATAC and SAGA-regulated programs explain multilevel KAT2A requirements in leukemia and in erythroid lineage specification and development. Importantly, they set a paradigm against which lineage specification and identity can be explored across developmental stem cell systems.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

The aim of this study was to examine associations of social support with overall survival (OS) and healthcare utilization in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional secondary analysis was conducted using data from a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 251 hospitalized patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2014 through 2017. Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to identify the extent of patients' social support (limited vs adequate as defined by NLP-aided chart review of the electronic health record). Multivariable regression models were used to examine associations of social support with (1) OS, (2) death or readmission within 90 days of discharge from index hospitalization, (3) time to readmission within 90 days, and (4) index hospitalization length of stay. RESULTS: Patients had a median age of 64 years (range, 19-93 years), and most were White (89.6%), male (68.9%), and married (65.3%). A plurality of patients had leukemia (42.2%) followed by lymphoma (37.9%) and myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (19.9%). Using NLP, we identified that 8.8% (n=22) of patients had limited social support. In multivariable analyses, limited social support was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 2.00; P=.042) and a higher likelihood of death or readmission within 90 days of discharge (odds ratio, 3.11; P=.043), but not with time to readmission within 90 days or with index hospitalization length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies, we found associations of limited social support with lower OS and a higher likelihood of death or readmission within 90 days of hospital discharge. These findings underscore the utility of NLP for evaluating the extent of social support and the need for larger studies evaluating social support in patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies.",,"['Johnson, P Connor', 'Markovitz, Netana H', 'Gray, Tamryn F', 'Bhatt, Sunil', 'Nipp, Ryan D', 'Ufere, Nneka', 'Rice, Julia', 'Reynolds, Matthew J', 'Lavoie, Mitchell W', 'Topping, Carlisle E W', 'Clay, Madison A', 'Lindvall, Charlotta', 'El-Jawahri, Areej']","['Johnson PC', 'Markovitz NH', 'Gray TF', 'Bhatt S', 'Nipp RD', 'Ufere N', 'Rice J', 'Reynolds MJ', 'Lavoie MW', 'Topping CEW', 'Clay MA', 'Lindvall C', 'El-Jawahri A']","['1Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', '2Harvard Medical School.', '1Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', '2Harvard Medical School.', '3Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', '1Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', '1Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', '2Harvard Medical School.', '2Harvard Medical School.', '4Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital; and.', '5Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '5Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '5Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '5Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '5Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2Harvard Medical School.', '3Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', '1Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', '2Harvard Medical School.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,IM,,,2021/10/16 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/10/15 20:31'],"['2020/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/15 20:31 [entrez]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.6004/jnccn.2021.7033 [doi]', 'jnccn20808 [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2021 Oct 15:1-7. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2021.7033.,,,1-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This propensity-score-matched cohort study was conducted using data collected from the Korean national health insurance service (NHIS) between January 2003 and December 2017. The HFRS cohort included 5888 newly diagnosed cases of HFRS, and 412,804 general participants from the NHIS database were included as the control cohort. The incidence rate of malignancies was assessed and compared between the HFRS and control cohorts. RESULTS: There were 64 cases of haematologic malignancy in 236,286 person-years of observation, and 1245 cases of solid organ cancer in 209,333 person-years. The risks of haematologic malignancy and solid organ cancer were significantly higher in the HFRS cohort [adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) 4.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-7.14] than the control cohort [aHR 2.97, 95% CI 2.60-3.38). In subgroup analysis, the HFRS cohort was associated with high hazard ratios for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The HFRS cohort also had increased aHRs for all types of solid organ cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HFRS are at increased risk of both haematologic and solid organ malignancies compared with the general population, and this increased proportionally over time. Careful monitoring for malignancy after the onset of HFRS may be necessary.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is an uncommon event in T-cell lymphomas, with wide variability among the different disease entities. CNS can be affected either at initial diagnosis or at recurrence, and both forms are considered ""secondary CNS T-cell lymphoma"". Given the low incidence of secondary CNS T-cell lymphoma, related literature is sparse, contradictory, and primarily constituted by small case series and single case reports. However, reported studies uniformly suggest high mortality rates related to this event. Therefore, to improve our ability to identify high-risk patients and offer them successful CNS prophylaxis or timely and effective treatment once the event has occurred may prevent CNS-related T-cell lymphomas deaths. For example, some entities like aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and other peripheral T-cell lymphomas with involvement of two or more extranodal organs are prone to CNS dissemination and should be considered for personalized CNS prophylaxis. The level of evidence suggesting an increased risk of CNS recurrence for other T-cell lymphomas and for other risk factors is lower. Published case series show that, following the example of aggressive B-cell lymphomas, patients with T-cell lymphomas and putative increased CNS risk receive different forms of prophylaxis, mostly methotrexate and cytarabine delivered by intrathecal and/or intravenous routes, with varied success. To date, achievements in the treatment of CNS involvement in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma were not replicated in secondary CNS T-cell lymphomas, and identification of effective therapies remains an urgent research target. This review is focused on clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with T-cell lymphoma experiencing CNS dissemination either at presentation or relapse. It aims to provide logical and, oftentimes, evidence-based answers to the most common questions on the most probable risk factors to CNS involvement in patients with T-cell lymphoma, the indications and strategies to prevent this life-threating event, and the management of patients with CNS disease.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the overall cardiovascular safety profile of these agents has not been studied adequately. METHODS: We searched the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for adverse events reported for several of these novel agents: ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and idelalisib. RESULTS: A total of 6074 cardiac adverse events were identified; ibrutinib (4832/36581; 13.2%) was found to have the highest risk of cardiac adverse events. The frequency of atrial fibrillation was highest (41.5%) in the ibrutinib group, while the idelalisib and acalabrutinib groups had the highest reported frequencies of heart failure (25.1%) and myocardial infarction (13.6%), respectively. Hypertension was noted to be relatively higher in the acalabrutinib (25.6%) and venetoclax (11.8%) groups. Overall reported mortality associated with cardiac events was highest in the venetoclax (29.4%) and idelalisib (27.1%) groups. CONCLUSION: Novel agents in the CLL armamentarium have been associated with several cardiovascular adverse events. Further studies are needed to identify high-risk groups that would benefit from robust cardiovascular surveillance after initiation of treatment with these novel agents.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Recent findings have suggested that bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a highly prevalent bovine virus worldwide, might be linked to human breast cancer. However, the involvement of BLV as a risk factor for breast cancer remains controversial. In this study, BLV FRET-PCR was carried out on 238 blood-derived DNA samples from breast cancer patients from the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort. In addition, randomly selected samples (n = 20) were evaluated by WGS for the presence of BLV genome. No BLV proviral DNA was detected in any of 238 samples assayed by FRET-qPCR in this study. Similarly, the WGS analysis did not detect the presence of the BLV genome in the DNA of the buffy coats from 20 randomly selected patients with breast cancer. This study did not support the findings of suggesting an association between BLV and breast cancer. Notably, nearly all the studies using in situ PCR and immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive associations while other studies using whole-genome sequencing and other methods failed to identify the BLV association with breast cancer. Further studies including all reported BLV detection techniques/methods on the same breast cancer sample sets would appear to be the most likely way of resolving the current contradictory evidence.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Among these, Cry and Cyt proteins are most explored as biopesticides for their action against agricultural pests and vectors of human diseases. In 2000, a group of researchers from Japan isolated parasporal inclusion proteins from B. thuringiensis, and reported their cytotoxic action against human leukemia. Later, other proteins with similar antitumor properties were also isolated from this bacterium and these cytotoxic proteins with specific activity against human cancer cells were named parasporins. At present, nineteen different parasporins are registered and classified in six families. These parasporins have been described to have specific in vitro antitumor activity against several cancer cell lines. The antitumor activity makes parasporins possible candidates as anticancer agents. Various research groups around the world are involved in isolating and characterizing in vitro antitumor activity of these proteins and many articles reporting such activities in detail have been published. However, there are virtually no data regarding the antitumor activity of parasporins in vivo. This review summarizes the properties of these potentially useful antitumor agents of natural origin, focusing on their in vivo activity thus also highlighting the importance of testing these proteins in animal models for a possible application in clinical oncology.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie', 'Moleculaire (SFBBM).

Loss-of-function mutations in this gene are observed in human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and a subset of Blnk knock-out (KO) mice develop pre-B-ALL. To understand the molecular mechanism of the Blnk mutation-associated pre-B-ALL development, retroviral tagging was applied to KO mice using the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). The Blnk mutation that significantly accelerated the onset of MoMLV-induced leukemia and increased the incidence of pre-B-ALL Cebpb was identified as a frequent site of retroviral integration, suggesting that its upregulation cooperates with Blnk mutations. Transgenic expression of the liver-enriched activator protein (LAP) isoform of Cebpb reduced the number of mature B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow and inhibited differentiation at the pre-BI stage. Furthermore, LAP expression significantly accelerated leukemogenesis in Blnk KO mice and alone acted as a B-cell oncogene. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between BLNK and C/EBPbeta expression was also noted in human pre-B-ALL cases, and the high level of CEBPB expression was associated with short survival periods in patients with BLNK-downregulated pre-B-ALL. These results indicate the association between the C/EBPbeta transcriptional network and BCR signaling in pre-B-ALL development and leukemogenesis. This study gives insight into ALL progression and suggests that the BCR/C/EBPbeta pathway can be a therapeutic target.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

AIM: To evaluate chemotherapy as a risk factor for caries lesions and gingivitis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with the ALL IC-BFM 2009 chemotherapy protocol. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was designed. Clinical records of 23 paediatric patients with ALL exposed to chemotherapy in the Regional Hospital in Valdivia, Chile, and 46 unexposed patients assessed every 3 months for 24 months were analyzed. The data on gender, age, index of the number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth, and the presence of gingivitis were recorded (Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis, p </= .05). RESULTS: A significantly greater frequency of gingivitis (69.57%; p < .002) and a mean of new caries lesions were observed in children treated with chemotherapy than in the unexposed children (p < .01). The chemotherapy protocol presented a relative risk of 2.15 (95% CI = 1.22 - 2.66; p = .01) for new caries lesions and 2.29 (95% CI = 1.76 - 3.82; p = .002) for gingivitis. CONCLUSION: The ALL IC-BFM 2009 chemotherapy protocol in patients with ALL is a risk factor for new caries lesions and gingivitis.","['(c) 2021 BSPD, IAPD and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.']","['Shayani, Anis', 'Aravena, Pedro Christian', 'Rodriguez-Salinas, Carolina', 'Escobar-Silva, Pamela', 'Diocares-Monsalvez, Yandolin', 'Angulo-Gutierrez, Carolina', 'Rivera, Cesar']","['Shayani A', 'Aravena PC', 'Rodriguez-Salinas C', 'Escobar-Silva P', 'Diocares-Monsalvez Y', 'Angulo-Gutierrez C', 'Rivera C']","['School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'Oral Medicine and Pathology Research Group, Department of Basic Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad de Talca, Talca, Chile.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211015,England,Int J Paediatr Dent,International journal of paediatric dentistry,9107511,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'cohort', 'dental caries', 'risk factor']",2021/10/16 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/10/15 17:18'],"['2021/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/15 17:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ipd.12932 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Paediatr Dent. 2021 Oct 15. doi: 10.1111/ipd.12932.,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8169-3501', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1230-4573', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-4233']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of the mutated allele in blood and marrow correlates with the presence of neoplastic cells and can be considered a marker of active disease. Likewise, the absence of the mutation after treatment may indicate a state of deep response. The BRAF(V600E) burden was measured by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and expressed as fractional abundance in 35 HCL patients at different stages of disease (onset, relapse, complete response [CR] after treatment, long-term remission) in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow (when available). Mean values of fractional abundance for patients at diagnosis, relapse and response, respectively, were 12.26%, 16.52% and 0.02% in peripheral blood and 23.51%, 13.96% and 0.26% in bone marrow. Four patients out of 6 evaluated at response were molecularly negative for BRAF(V600E) in peripheral blood. Mean fractional abundance in peripheral blood tested in 14 patients with long lasting CR was 0.05%, and 10 patients were BRAF(V600E) negative. These preliminary results suggest that ddPCR permits to assess the active tumor burden in HCL at different disease phases and support the hypothesis that some patients in CR qualify for a molecular CR.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To study IgE and IgG antibody specificities in patients with defined hyper-IgE syndromes (HIES) using a comprehensive panel of allergen molecules. METHODS: We used chips containing micro-arrayed allergen molecules to analyze allergen-specific IgE and IgG levels in sera from two groups of HIES patients: Autosomal recessive mutations in phosphoglucomutase-3 (PGM3); Autosomal dominant negative mutations of STAT3 (STAT3); and age-matched subjects with allergic sensitizations. Assays with rat basophil leukemia cells transfected with human FcepsilonRI were performed to study the biological relevance of IgE sensitizations. RESULTS: Median total IgE levels were significantly lower in the sensitized control group (212.9 kU/L) as compared to PGM3 (5042 kU/L) and STAT3 patients (2561 kU/L). However, PGM3 patients had significantly higher allergen-specific IgE levels and were sensitized to a larger number of allergen molecules as compared to STAT3 patients. Biological relevance of IgE sensitization was confirmed for PGM3 patients by basophil activation testing. PGM3 patients showed significantly lower cumulative allergen-specific IgG responses in particular to milk and egg allergens as compared to STAT3 patients and sensitized controls whereas total IgG levels were comparable to STAT3 patients and significantly higher than in controls. CONCLUSION: The analysis with multiple micro-arrayed allergen molecules reveals profound differences of allergen-specific IgE and IgG recognition in PGM3 and STAT3 patients which may be useful for classification of IEI and clinical characterization of patients.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Here, we report the successful use of midostaurin to treat three FLT3-positive MPAL T/myeloid and B/myeloid patients. Midostaurin was successfully added to intensive induction (two patients) and consolidation chemotherapy (three patients) without significant adverse events requiring a dose adjustment or discontinuation. The therapy received resulted in complete remission for two patients and complete remission with an incomplete hematologic recovery for the third. All patients proceeded to HSCT and stayed in remission after an extended follow-up respectively at 28, 31, and 11 months later.

No oral therapies are approved for PTCL, and better treatments for relapsed/refractory disease are urgently needed. We conducted a phase 2 study of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib for patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL (n = 45) or mycosis fungoides (MF) (n = 7). Patients enrolled onto 1 of 3 biomarker-defined cohorts: (1) activating JAK and/or STAT mutations, (2) >/=30% pSTAT3 expression among tumor cells by immunohistochemistry, or (3) neither or insufficient tissue to assess. Patients received ruxolitinib 20 mg PO twice daily until progression and were assessed for response after cycles 2 and 5 and every 3 cycles thereafter. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the combination of complete response, partial response (PR), and stable disease lasting at least 6 months. Only 1 of 7 patients with MF had CBR (ongoing PR > 18 months). CBR among the PTCL cases (n = 45) in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 were 53%, 45%, and 13% (cohorts 1 & 2 vs 3, P = .02), respectively. Eight patients had CBR > 12 months (5 ongoing), including 4 of 5 patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia. In an exploratory analysis using multiplex immunofluorescence, expression of phosphorylated S6, a marker of PI3 kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, in <25% of tumor cells was associated with response to ruxolitinib (P = .05). Our findings indicate that ruxolitinib is active across various PTCL subtypes and support a precision therapy approach to JAK/STAT inhibition in patients with PTCL.

The clinical course is variable, multiple genes are mutated with no unifying mechanism, essential regulatory pathways and surrounding microenvironments are diverse. We sought to clarify the heterogeneity of SMZL by resolving different subgroups and their underlying genomic abnormalities, pathway signatures and microenvironment compositions to uncover biomarkers and therapeutic vulnerabilities. We studied 303 SMZL spleen samples collected through the IELSG46 multicenter, international study (NCT02945319) by using a multiplatform approach. We carried out genetic and phenotypic analyses, defined self-organized signatures, validated the findings in independent primary tumor meta-data and in genetically modified mouse models, and determined correlations with outcome data. We identified two prominent genetic clusters in SMZL, termed NNK (58% of cases, harboring NF-kappaB, NOTCH and KLF2 modules) and DMT (32% of cases, with DNA-damage response, MAPK and TLR modules). Genetic aberrations in multiple genes as well as cytogenetic and immunogenetic features distinguished NNK- from DMT-SMZLs. These genetic clusters not only have distinct underpinning biology, as judged by differences in gene-expression signatures, but also different outcome, with inferior survival in NNK-SMZLs. Digital cytometry and in situ profiling segregated two basic types of SMZL immune microenvironments termed immune-suppressive SMZL (50% of cases, associated with inflammatory cells and immune checkpoint activation) and immune-silent SMZL (50% of cases, associated with an immune-excluded phenotype) with distinct mutational and clinical connotations.

In this exploratory proof of concept study, our objective was to determine the prevalence of humoral immunodeficiency in patients with CLL and serum IgG >/= 400 mg/dL, and to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CLL with serum IgG >/= 400 mg/dL were evaluated for serum IgG, IgM, IgA, along with pre/post vaccine IgG titers to diphtheria, tetanus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Patients with evidence of humoral dysfunction were treated with SCIG with Hizentra every 7+/-2 days for 24 weeks. RESULTS: Fifteen patients enrolled with median IgG = 782 mg/dL [IQR: 570 to 827], and 6/15 (40%) responded to vaccination with Td, while 5/15 (33%) responded to vaccination with PPV23. 14/15 (93.3%) demonstrated humoral immunodeficiency as evidenced by suboptimal vaccine responses, and were treated with SCIG. In patients treated with SCIG, serum IgG increased from 670 mg/dL [IQR: 565 to 819] to 1054 mg/dL [IQR: 1040 to 1166] after 24 weeks (95% CI: 271-540). For streptococcus pneumoniae, the median protective serotypes at baseline was 8 [IQR: 4 to 9] and increased to 17 [IQR: 17 to 19] after 24 weeks (95% CI: 6.93-13.72). Non-neutropenic infections (NNI) decreased from 14 to 5 during treatment with SCIG. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLL demonstrate humoral immunodeficiency despite IgG > 400 mg/dL. For these patients, SCIG is well tolerated and efficacious in improving serum IgG, specific IgG to streptococcus pneumoniae, and may decrease reliance on antibiotics for the treatment of NNIs.

Data sources: Published literature as indexed in Medline, relevant guideline documents, textbooks and clinical experience. Conclusion: Patients with acute leukemia have significant nursing care demands that are frequently unmet by routine oncology treatment. The initial introduction of expert nursing care into routine oncology treatment boosts patient-centered results in people with advanced solid tumors, according to research. Recent data suggest that patients with hematologic malignancies who have undergone transplantation of stem cells have similarly improved, and further trials are being conducted to assess nursing care treatments in patients with acute leukemia.

The objectives of our cohort study were to study the incidence and risk factors for hyperglycaemia in leukaemia and lymphoma patients. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 15 years of data from paediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) immediately at cancer diagnosis. We studied risk factors for hyperglycaemia in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Our study cohort included 267 patients corresponding to 179 patients with ALL, 48 with NHL and 40 with HL. Eighteen per cent of ALL patients (32/179) and 17% of NHL patients (8/48) developed hyperglycaemia, with more than 61% developing hyperglycaemia within the first month of treatment. No hyperglycaemia was observed in HL patients. Multivariate analysis showed the following hyperglycaemia risk factors for ALL patients: overweight or obesity (OR 3.793) and pubertal onset (OR 4.269) at cancer diagnosis, steroid-resistant disease (OR 3.445) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (OR 4.754). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, 18% of patients with ALL or NHL developed early-onset hyperglycaemia after chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Patients with ALL with increased hyperglycaemia risk can be readily identified by measuring BMI and puberty stage at cancer diagnosis. Also, glucose monitoring should be reinforced when patients show steroid-resistant disease and/or require HSCT.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Exposure to benzene through parental occupation and the use of household products has been associated with childhood leukemia (CL). Ambient benzene has also been associated with CL and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. We aimed to investigate whether the higher ambient levels of benzene in proximity of petrol stations are associated with a greater risk of childhood cancers, leukemia, and CNS tumors. METHODS: We identified children diagnosed with cancer at age 0-15 years during 1985-2015 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry and selected 10 age and sex-matched controls per case from national censuses. We calculated the distance from children's home to the nearest petrol station using precise geocodes. We estimated odds ratios using conditional logistic regression adjusting for ambient levels of NO2, distance to highways, level of urbanization, and presence of a cantonal cancer registry. In addition, we ran a meta-analysis pooling current results for CL with those of previous studies. RESULTS: We identified 6129 cases, of which 1880 were leukemias and 1290 CNS tumors. 24 cases lived within 50 m from a petrol station. The adjusted odds ratio of a cancer diagnosis for children thus exposed compared to unexposed children (> 500 m) was 1.29 (0.84-1.98) for all cancers combined, 1.08 (0.46-2.51) for leukemia, and 1.30 (0.51-3.35) for CNS tumors. During 2000-2015, when exposure assessment was more precise, the adjusted odds ratio for any cancer diagnosis was 1.77 (1.05-2.98). The summary relative risk estimate for CL in the meta-analysis including four studies was 2.01 (1.25-3.22).

The focus was specifically on support from parents and healthcare professionals. DESIGN: The study had a qualitative descriptive longitudinal design. METHODS: The study analysed 35 interviews with 13 children at three different times during their treatment period. Data were analysed using a matrix-based method. The Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines have been followed. RESULTS: Parents and healthcare professionals provide important support to children undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, although their roles differ. Children valued their parents' closeness and advocacy, being able to participate in their own care, and being given pain relief during procedures known to create pain. Valued support from healthcare professionals changed over time, from providing information and showing the tools that would be used in procedures, to paying attention to the child's needs and desires. It was more important for children to be able to choose between different alternatives in medical procedures than deciding on major treatment issues.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

These proteins are involved in the regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional viral expression, as well as having oncogenic potential. Our goal was to investigate the pathogenicity of the pX region of BLV genotype 1 in terms of lymphocytosis, lymphomas, and proviral DNA load. We screened 724 serological samples from mixed-age Holstein Friesian cattle from six states in Mexico. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from whole blood with anticoagulant, and genomic DNA was extracted from the PBLs using a commercial kit. Then, a set of primers that hybridize in conserved regions of the BLV pX region were used, which allowed for PCR standardization to detect proviral DNA in infected cells. Positive amplicons were sequenced using the Sanger method, resulting in 1156-nucleotide-long final sequences that included the four pX region genes. The experimental group consisted of 30 animals. Twelve of these had lymphocytosis, six had lymphoma, and 12 were apparently healthy cattle without any signs of lymphocytosis or lymphoma. The presence of lymphoma was detected in six bovine tumor tissues using histopathology, and the presence of BLV was detected by in situ hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the 30 sequences were associated with genotype 1, and the genetic distance between the sequences ranged from 0.2% to 2.09%. We identified two sequences in the G4 gene: one with a three-nucleotide deletion resulting in the loss of a leucine (AGU_7488L, in a cow with lymphocytosis), and one with a nine-nucleotide deletion resulting in the loss of leucine, proline, and leucine (AGU_18A, in a cow without lymphocytosis). Analysis of the PX region indicated that positive selection had occurred in the G4, rex, and R3 genes, and we found no difference in proviral DNA load between the studied groups. We were unable to establish an association between variations in the pX region and the development of lymphocytosis, lymphoma, asymptomatic status, or proviral DNA load in BLV-infected cattle.","['(c) 2021.

Thus, it is necessary to elevate serum TSH levels by T4 withdraw or rTSH administration to facilitate radioiodide ((131)I) therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, non-iodide-avid metastases of DTC which is dedifferentiated do not respond to stimulation by high levels of TSH, suggesting abnormal TSH-TSHR signal transduction in cancer cells. In addition, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling activation has been shown to be associated with the dedifferentiated phenotype of thyroid cancer, but the mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the role of abnormal TSH-TSHR signaling activation in regulating iodide uptake and cell mobility in thyroid cancer and its relationship with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. We found that in thyroid cancer cells, TSH binds TSHR coupled to the Galpha12/13 protein and then activates RhoA through interacting with leukemia associated RhoA guanine exchange factor (LARG). This results in a promigration tumorigenic phenotype independent of canonical TSHR-GalphaS signaling that regulates the expression of molecules involved in iodine uptake and metabolism. We observed that signaling pathways downstream of Galpha12/13 signaling were increased, while that of Galphas signaling was decreased in thyroid cancer cells undergoing dedifferentiation compared to control cells following stimulation with different levels of TSH. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling activation enhanced Galpha12/13 signaling through increasing LARG levels but also inhibited the expression of molecules downstream of Galphas signaling, including thyroid-specific molecules, and iodide uptake. In summary, our results demonstrate the noncanonical activation of TSH-TSHR signaling and its role in increasing the cell mobility and dedifferentiation of thyroid cancer through crosstalk with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Feng, Han, Wu and Wang.']","['Feng, Fang', 'Han, Huiqin', 'Wu, Shuqi', 'Wang, Hui']","['Feng F', 'Han H', 'Wu S', 'Wang H']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210928,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['dedifferentiation', 'differentiated thyroid carcinoma', 'migration', 'radioiodine', 'thyrotropin receptor']",2021/10/16 06:00,2021/10/16 06:01,['2021/10/15 06:38'],"['2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/15 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.718578 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 28;11:718578. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.718578. eCollection 2021.,11,,718578,,,PMC8506026,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, approximately 50% of patients have a response to hypomethylating agents (HMAs), and many patients have no response originally or in the process of treatment. Even though new combination regimens have been tested to overcome the resistance to 5-AZA-dC or 5-AZA, only a small proportion of patients benefited from these strategies, and the outcome was very poor. However, the mechanisms of the resistance remain unknown. Some studies only partially described management after failure and the mechanisms of resistance.

However, it is unclear if this subset of patients would benefit from EGFR signaling pharmacological inhibition. Pre-clinical studies on AML cells provided evidence on the pro-differentiation benefits of EGFR inhibitors when combined with ATRA or ATO in vitro. Despite the success of ATRA and ATO in the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), therapy-associated resistance is observed in 5-10% of the cases, pointing to a clear need for new therapeutic strategies for those patients. In this context, the functional role of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors has never been evaluated in APL. Here, we investigated the EGFR pathway in primary samples along with functional in vitro and in vivo studies using several APL models. We observed that total and phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr992) was expressed in 28% and 19% of blast cells from APL patients, respectively, but not in healthy CD34(+) samples. Interestingly, the expression of the EGF was lower in APL plasma samples than in healthy controls. The EGFR ligand AREG was detected in 29% of APL patients at diagnosis, but not in control samples. In vitro, treatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (ZD1839) reduced cell proliferation and survival of NB4 (ATRA-sensitive) and NB4-R2 (ATRA-resistant) cells. Moreover, the combination of gefitinib with ATRA and ATO promoted myeloid cell differentiation in ATRA- and ATO-resistant APL cells. In vivo, the combination of gefitinib and ATRA prolonged survival compared to gefitinib- or vehicle-treated leukemic mice in a syngeneic transplantation model, while the gain in survival did not reach statistical difference compared to treatment with ATRA alone. Our results suggest that gefitinib is a potential adjuvant agent that can mitigate ATRA and ATO resistance in APL cells. Therefore, our data indicate that repurposing FDA-approved tyrosine-kinase inhibitors could provide new perspectives into combination therapy to overcome drug resistance in APL patients.","['Copyright

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is CAR-T's clinically hazardous side effect, ranging from mild to life-threatening events. It was one of the first side effects detected with CAR-T. We conducted a literature review using PubMed (MeSH) to study CRS incidence after the administration of CAR-T to reflect its clinical importance. Nine studies are mentioned, with a total of 1357 patients enrolled for different types of refractory/relapsed cancers, and an average incidence of CRS of 64% is being noted. We have also stated numerous studies which mentioned the use and effectiveness of the commonly used drugs like tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and some new drugs. Although statistical data on CRS's conservative and supportive management is not available, the role of different supportive measures is evident. An overview of how it sets the framework of a peri-management approach has been considered. Through heightened incidence and relatively complex management of CRS, we would like to raise the question of the need for early prophylaxis against CRS when considering CAR-T. The need for more clinical trials in the future to prove the effectiveness of the latter is stated.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Dave et al.']","['Dave, Prashil', 'Pallares Vela, Elisa', 'Cancarevic, Ivan']","['Dave P', 'Pallares Vela E', 'Cancarevic I']","['General Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'General Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210904,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer-immunotherapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapy', 'cytokine release syndrome (crs)', 'incidence rate', 'leukaemia', 'management strategies', 'oncology clinical trials', 'relapsing multiple myeloma']",2021/10/16 06:00,2021/10/16 06:01,['2021/10/15 06:37'],"['2021/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/15 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.17709 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Sep 4;13(9):e17709. doi: 10.7759/cureus.17709. eCollection 2021 Sep.,13,9,e17709,,,PMC8489777,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of AML. The GSE65409 and GSE90062 were selected from the AML database of the Gene Expression Omnibus and compared using the GEO2R tool to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery was used to perform gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses of the DEGs. Protein-protein interactions were visualized using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, which identified two potential hub genes that encode CDC45 and MCM7. Relative to AML specimens, normal specimens had higher expression levels of CDC45 and MCM7 based on the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between CDC45 and MCM7. High expression of CDC45 was positively correlated with complete remission and negatively correlated with white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and bone marrow blasts. Moreover, high expression of MCM7 was negatively correlated with white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, bone marrow blasts, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Overexpression of CDC45 increased the expressions of CDC45 and MCM7, while overexpression of MCM7 increased the expression of MCM7 but not CDC45. Overexpression of CDC45 or MCM7 led to impaired AML cell proliferation and blockage at the G1/S phase transition. Overexpression of CDC45 or MCM7 also attenuated the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, while simultaneous down-regulation of MCM7 expression abolished the effects of CDC45 overexpression. These findings suggest a functional relationship between CDC45 and MCM7, which might have use in the diagnosis and treatment of AML.",['AJTR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Zhang, Rong', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Zhang, Guojun']","['Zhang R', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang G']","[""Department of Hematology, Shenjing Hospital of China Medical University Shenyang, Liaoning Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shenjing Hospital of China Medical University Shenyang, Liaoning Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shenjing Hospital of China Medical University Shenyang, Liaoning Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210915,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CDC45', 'MCM7', 'cell cycle', 'cell proliferation']",2021/10/16 06:00,2021/10/16 06:01,['2021/10/15 06:36'],"['2021/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/15 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2021 Sep 15;13(9):10218-10232. eCollection 2021.,13,9,10218-10232,,,PMC8507005,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at exploring the regulatory function of circMYC in AML progression. METHODS: Expression levels of CircMYC, miR-516a-5p, AKT3 and apoptosis-related proteins were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot. Cell viability and proliferation were examined by CCK8 assay and EdU assay. Annexin V/PI staining was used to assess cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial respiration function was confirmed by oxygen consumption rate (OCR). The relationships among circMYC, miR-516a-5p and AKT3 were detected by dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay, RNA-pull down assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, respectively. RESULTS: CircMYC was positively correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients (all P<0.05). Knockdown of circMYC decreased cell viability and OCR but increased cell apoptosis rates (all P<0.05), and miR-516a-5p overexpression displayed the similar trend. Mechanistically, the oncogenic effects of circMYC were achieved by sponging miR-516a-5p and increasing AKT3. CONCLUSION: Decreased expression of circMYC could suppress AML progression by regulating miR-516a-5p/AKT3, suggesting a new therapeutic target in AML treatment.",['AJTR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Zou, Xueqin', 'Jiang, Min']","['Zou X', 'Jiang M']","['Health Management Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shenzhen University General Hospital Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210915,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT3', 'AML', 'Cell apoptosis', 'circMYC', 'miR-516a-5p', 'mitochondrial respiration']",2021/10/16 06:00,2021/10/16 06:01,['2021/10/15 06:36'],"['2021/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/15 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2021 Sep 15;13(9):10112-10126. eCollection 2021.,13,9,10112-10126,,,PMC8507023,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the study, 11 patients who were newly diagnosed with MLL-AF6 positive AML were analyzed retrospectively, related literature was reviewed to clarify the clinical features and prognosis of MLL-AF6 positive patients. RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, there were 6 males and 5 females, with a median age of 36 years. Six patients were diagnosed with AML M5 and five with M4 according to FAB classification (French-American-British classification systems). Gingival swelling and pain occurred in 6 cases and fever occurred in 5 cases. At first diagnosis, the median white blood cells were 55.5x10(9)/L. Immunotype showed the expression of myeloid/monocyte and early stem cell series antigens. The expression level of MLL-AF6 fusion gene (real-time quantitative PCR) was 14.2%-214.5%, and 6/11 cases (54.5%) were associated with high EVI1 gene expression. Mutations of KRAS, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, DNMT3A, and FLT3-ITD were detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) in 4 patients. Chromosome G banding examination showed that 2 cases were t(6;11)(q27, q23) with complex karyotype abnormality, 4 cases with +8 abnormality and 2 cases with normal karyotype. Hematological complete remission (CR) was achieved in 8/11 patients (72.7%) after conventional induction chemotherapy, and primary drug resistance was observed in 3 patients. Two of the eight patients with CR were negative for minimal residual disease (MRD), with a median CR duration of 4.5 months. Two patients with positive MRD and three patients with refractory recurrence underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), but all died due to leukemia progression. At the end of follow-up on December 1, 2019, 2 patients were alive and 9 died, with median survival time of 9 months. CONCLUSION: The AML patients with MLL-AF6 positive were mostly young, the majority of FAB types were M4 and M5, and most of the patients often had fever as the first symptom, with increased white blood cells, accompanied by organ infiltration, and high EVI1 gene expression. The hematological remission rate of routine chemotherapy is not low, but it is difficult to achieve molecular remission, most of which have early recurrence.

We previously reported that DLEU1 (deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1) is one of the lncRNAs overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells, where it exhibits oncogenic activity. In the present study, we further clarified the molecular function of DLEU1 in the pathogenesis of OSCC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that DLEU1 knockdown induced significant changes in the levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in OSCC cells. Notably, DLEU1 knockdown suppressed levels of H3K4me3/ H3K27ac and expression of a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFIT1, IFI6 and OAS1, while ectopic DLEU1 expression activated these genes. Western blot analysis and reporter assays suggested that DLEU1 upregulates ISGs through activation of JAK-STAT signaling in OSCC cells. Moreover, IFITM1, one of the ISGs induced by DLUE1, was frequently overexpressed in primary OSCC tumors, and its knockdown inhibited OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These findings suggest that DLEU1 exerts its oncogenic effects, at least in part, through activation of a series ISGs in OSCC cells.",['(c) 2021.

Though superficial edema is a common adverse effect of imatinib, massive fluid retention is rarely reported. Here, we report the case of an adolescent who had tolerated imatinib for a long time, and then presented with massive pleural/pericardial effusion during an episode of Campylobacter jejuni bacteremia. A stepwise and comprehensive survey excluded all other plausible causes of disease. The Naranjo scale was used to assess the probability of an adverse effect of medication, and the score turned out to be 9, indicating severe fluid retention to be a definite reaction to imatinib. Drug discontinuation, antibiotic administration, and invasive procedures improved this condition. After this episode, the patient could tolerate imatinib again, illustrating the transient and reversible nature of this reaction. Since prolonged imatinib usage is crucial for chronic myeloid leukemia control, alertness to drug-related adverse effects is recommended, even if the subject has previously shown a good tolerance to the drug due to various physical conditions, especially physiological stressors, like infection or inflammation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

A better understanding of risk factors for adverse outcomes may improve clinical management in these patients. We therefore studied baseline characteristics of HM patients developing COVID-19 and analyzed predictors of mortality. METHODS: The survey was supported by the Scientific Working Group Infection in Hematology of the European Hematology Association (EHA). Eligible for the analysis were adult patients with HM and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 observed between March and December 2020. RESULTS: The study sample includes 3801 cases, represented by lymphoproliferative (mainly non-Hodgkin lymphoma n = 1084, myeloma n = 684 and chronic lymphoid leukemia n = 474) and myeloproliferative malignancies (mainly acute myeloid leukemia n = 497 and myelodysplastic syndromes n = 279). Severe/critical COVID-19 was observed in 63.8% of patients (n = 2425). Overall, 2778 (73.1%) of the patients were hospitalized, 689 (18.1%) of whom were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Overall, 1185 patients (31.2%) died. The primary cause of death was COVID-19 in 688 patients (58.1%), HM in 173 patients (14.6%), and a combination of both COVID-19 and progressing HM in 155 patients (13.1%). Highest mortality was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (199/497, 40%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (118/279, 42.3%). The mortality rate significantly decreased between the first COVID-19 wave (March-May 2020) and the second wave (October-December 2020) (581/1427, 40.7% vs. 439/1773, 24.8%, p value < 0.0001). In the multivariable analysis, age, active malignancy, chronic cardiac disease, liver disease, renal impairment, smoking history, and ICU stay correlated with mortality. Acute myeloid leukemia was a higher mortality risk than lymphoproliferative diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This survey confirms that COVID-19 patients with HM are at high risk of lethal complications. However, improved COVID-19 prevention has reduced mortality despite an increase in the number of reported cases.",['(c) 2021.

34649555,NLM,MEDLINE,20211022,1472-684X (Electronic) 1472-684X (Linking),2021 Oct 15,The effect of a single session of 30-min mindful breathing in reducing fatigue among patients with haematological cancer - a randomised controlled trial.,10.1186/s12904-021-00855-7 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Patients with haematological cancer had considerable symptom burden, in which fatigue was the most prevalent. Almost 70% of haematological cancer patients reported fatigue. METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded, randomised control trial at the haemato-oncology unit of University Malaya Medical Centre, from 1st October 2019 to 31st May 2020. Patients included were >/= 18 years, had histopathological diagnosis of haematological cancer, and fatigue score of >/=4 based on the fatigue subscale of Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). Patients allocated to the intervention group received standard care plus a guided 30-min mindful breathing session, while those in control group received standard care. The study outcomes include fatigue severity according to the fatigue subscale of ESAS, visual analogue scale of 0 - 10, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale Version 4, at minute 0 and minute 30. RESULTS: Of 197 patients screened, 80 were eligible and they were equally randomised into 30-min mindful breathing versus standard care. Lymphoma (58.9%) was the commonest haematological malignancy, followed by multiple myeloma (13.8%), acute leukaemia (11.3%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (6.3%), chronic leukaemia (5.0%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (5.0%). There was no difference in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the 2 groups. At minute 0, both arms of patients had similar ESAS-fatigue score (median, 5) and FACIT-fatigue score (mean +/- SD, 24.7 +/- 10.6 for intervention group versus 24.7 +/- 9.7 for control group). At minute 30, intervention group had lower ESAS-fatigue score (median, 3 versus 5) and FACIT-fatigue score (mean +/- SD, 17.1 +/- 10.5 versus 24.8 +/- 11.3) compared to control group. Both the ESAS-fatigue score reduction (median, - 2 versus 0, p = 0.002) and FACIT-fatigue score reduction (mean +/- SD, - 6.7 versus + 0.8; p < 0.001) for the intervention group were statistically significant. The calculated effect size Cohen's d was 1.4 for between-group comparison of differences in total FACIT-fatigue score. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that a single session of 30-min mindful breathing was effective in reducing fatigue in haematological cancer patients.

It is caused by abnormal cell division of the lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. In the past decade, metformin has gained increased attention for its anti-leukemic potential. Moreover, other chemotherapeutic agents were investigated for the possible superior efficacy over the existing treatments in treating ALL. Several studies examined the effect of cisplatin as a potential candidate for therapy. Here, we investigate the anti-leukemic effect of metformin and cisplatin on 697 cells. Both compounds revealed significant cytotoxic effects. Specifically designed lipid-based cubosomal nanoformulations were used as drug carriers to facilitate compound entry in low doses. Our results indicate that the use of the carrier did not affect cytotoxicity significantly. In addition, combining the drugs in different carriers demonstrated an antagonistic effect through damping the efficacy of both drugs. This was evident from experiments investigating cellular viability, annexin V/PI staining, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activity. Taken together, it appears that metformin does not represent a suitable option for sensitizing leukemia cells to cisplatin.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

This prospective study evaluated serological and T-cell responses after complete mRNA vaccination in 263 patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B- and T-cell lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Results were compared with those of 167 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Overall, patient seroconversion rate was 64.6%: serological response was lower in those receiving anti-cancer treatments in the 12 months before vaccination: 55% vs 81.9% (P < 0.001). Anti-CD20 antibody plus chemotherapy treatment was associated with the lowest seroconversion rate: 17.6% vs. 71.2% (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis conducted in the subgroup of patients on active treatment, independent predictors for seroconversion were: anti-CD20 treatment (P < 0.001), aggressive B-cell lymphoma diagnosis (P = 0.002), and immunoglobulin M levels <40 mg/dl (P = 0.030). The T-cell response was evaluated in 99 patients and detected in 85 of them (86%). Of note, 74% of seronegative patients had a T-cell response, but both cellular and humoral responses were absent in 13.1% of cases. Our findings raise some concerns about the protection that patients with LM, particularly those receiving anti-CD20 antibodies, may gain from vaccination. These patients should strictly maintain all the protective measures.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, prognosis for old or unfit patients remains poor. In the INCB84344-201 (formerly GIMEMA LAL 1811) prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial, we tested the efficacy and safety of ponatinib plus prednisone in newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL aged >/=60 years, or unfit for intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Forty-four patients received oral ponatinib 45 mg/day for 48 weeks (core phase), with prednisone tapered to 60 mg/m2/day from days -14 to 29. Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was administered monthly. Median age was 66.5 years (range, 26-85). The primary endpoint (complete hematologic response [CHR] at 24 weeks) was reached in 38/44 patients (86.4%); complete molecular response (CMR) was reached in 18/44 patients (40.9%) at 24 weeks. 61.4% of patients completed the core phase. As of April 24, 2020, median event-free survival was 14.31 months (95% CI 9.30, 22.31). Median overall survival and duration of CHR were not reached; median duration of CMR was 11.6 months. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were rash (36.4%), asthenia (22.7%), alanine transaminase increased (15.9%), erythema (15.9%), and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (15.9%). Cardiac and vascular TEAEs occurred in 29.5% (grade >/=3, 18.2%) and 27.3% (grade >/=3, 15.9%) of patients, respectively. Dose reductions/interruptions/discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred in 43.2%/43.2%/27.3% of patients; 5 patients had fatal TEAEs. Ponatinib and prednisone had efficacy in unfit patients with Ph+ ALL; however, a lower ponatinib dose may be more appropriate in this population.

Radioimmunotherapy using 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan can induce disease control across lymphoma subtypes in a dose-dependent fashion. We hypothesized that megadoses of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan with reduced-intensity conditioning could safely produce deeper remissions in aggressive BCL further maintained with the immunologic effect of allo-HCT. In this phase 2 study, CD20+ BCL patients received outpatient 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (1.5 mCi/kg; maximum, 120 mCi), fludarabine, and then 2 Gy total body irradiation before HLA-matched allo-HCT. Twenty patients were enrolled after a median of 4.5 prior lines of therapy, including 14 with prior autologous transplant and 4 with prior anti-CD19 chimeric T-cellular therapy. A median 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan activity of 113.6 mCi (range, 71.2-129.2 mCi) was administered, delivering a median of 552 cGy to the liver (range, 499-2411 cGy). The estimated 1- and 5-year progression-free survival was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31-73) and 50% (95% CI, 27-69) with a median progression-free survival of 1.57 years. The estimated 1- and 5-year overall survival was 80% (95% CI, 54-92) and 63% (95% CI, 38-81) with a median overall survival of 6.45 years. Sixteen patients (80%) experienced grade 3 or higher toxicities, although nonrelapse mortality was 10% at 1 year. No patients developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. Megadose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, fludarabine, and low-dose total body irradiation followed by an HLA-matched allo-HCT was feasible, safe, and effective in treating aggressive BCL, exceeding the prespecified end point while producing nonhematologic toxicities comparable to those of standard reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

OBJECTIVE: to report the outcome of childhood ALL at Ain Shams University Children's Hospitals with the use of risk-based protocols before the implementation of minimal residual disease technology and to evaluate the use of double delayed intensification (DDI) in standard risk patients. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty patients with ALL diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2014 were included in the study. Patients were treated according to a modified CCG 1991 and 1961 for standard and high risk respectively. Patients were stratified into three risk groups: standard risk (SR), high-risk standard arm (HR-SA), and high-risk augmented arm (HR-AA). RESULTS: Among the whole cohort, the 10-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 78.1% and 84.3% respectively. Patients with Pre-B immunophenotype (IPT) had significantly better outcome than T-cell IPT (EFS 82.0% versus 58.6%, p < 0.001; OS 86.9% versus 69%, p = 0.003 for Pre-B and T-cell respectively). Among the SR group, patients treated with single delayed intensification (SDI) had comparable EFS and OS rates when compared to patients treated with DDI with EFS 82.4% versus 87.5%, p = 0.825 and OS 88.2% versus 93.5%, p = 0.638 for SDI and DDI groups, respectively.

Whether these patients are more susceptible to poor outcomes and recurrence of COVID-19 is unknown. We report a retrospective analysis of outcomes of 15 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who experienced COVID-19 and subsequently underwent autologous (n = 8) or allogeneic (n = 7) HCT between June 17, 2020, and February 17, 2021. The cohort included patients with asymptomatic past infections or symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Data were obtained from chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. Among eight patients who underwent autologous HCT, four had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and four had a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four of these eight patients did not test positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody at any point during the course of treatment. The other four patients had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies before undergoing autologous HCT, but only two of these patients remained anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody-positive at their last follow-up. One patient died from progression of disease. Seven patients with prior COVID-19 underwent allogeneic HCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 1), chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis (n = 1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), or myelofibrosis (n = 1). Three of the seven patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies following the initial COVID-19 diagnosis; however, only one of these patients retained anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody following allogeneic HCT. One patient died of infection (fungal and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) occurring in the context of ongoing treatment for graft-versus-host disease. None of the 15 patients had recurrent COVID-19 infection. Based on our experience, autologous and allogeneic HCT can be safely performed in selected patients with previous COVID-19 infection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the clinical setting, evaluation of measurable residual disease during treatment and follow-up is highly dependent on knowledge of the diversity of blast subsets. Here, we set out to evaluate whether variation in expression of the blast marker, TdT, in T-ALL blasts could correspond to differences in morphometric features. METHODS: We investigated diagnostic bone marrow samples from six individual T-ALL patients run in parallel on imaging flow cytometry (IFC) and conventional flow cytometry (CFC). RESULTS: Guided by the imagery available in IFC, we identified distinct TdT(neg) and TdT(pos) subpopulations with apparent differences in internal complexity. As TdT(neg) blasts predominantly displayed very low forward scatter (FSC) on CFC, these subsets were initially excluded from routine analysis as debris, elements of small diameter, apoptotic, and/or dead cells. However, IFC-based morphometric analyses demonstrated that cell size and shape of TdT(neg) blasts were comparable to the TdT(pos) cells and without morphometric apoptotic hallmarks, supporting that the TdT(neg) subpopulation corresponded to T-ALL blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses substantiated the clinical relevance of TdT(neg) FSC(very-low) cells by retrieving known diagnostic cytogenetic abnormalities at comparable frequencies in purified TdT(neg) FSC(very-low) and TdT(pos) FSC(int) subsets. CONCLUSION: We highlight this finding as knowledge of phenotypic heterogeneity is of crucial importance in the clinical setting for delineation and quantification of blast subpopulations of potential biological relevance. We argue that the IFC imagery may allow for visual verification and improvement of applied gating strategies.",['(c) 2021 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Rosenberg, Carina A', 'Bill, Marie', 'Maguire, Orla', 'Petersen, Marianne A', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Ludvigsen, Maja']","['Rosenberg CA', 'Bill M', 'Maguire O', 'Petersen MA', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Hokland P', 'Ludvigsen M']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Flow and Image Cytometry Shared Resource, Roswell Park Cancer Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211014,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

PROCEDURE: This article analyses the outcomes of children treated with HR blocks between 2004 and 2017 according to DCOG ALL10/11 protocols. 1297 patients with newly diagnosed ALL were consecutively enrolled, of which 107 met the HR criteria (no complete remission; minimal residual disease (MRD) > 10(-3) after consolidation; ""MLL-AF4"" translocation and in ALL-10 also poor prednisone response). Patients were treated with one induction and consolidation course followed by three HR chemotherapy blocks, after which they received either SCT or further chemotherapy. MRD levels were measured at end of induction, consolidation, and after each HR block. RESULTS: At five years, the event-free survival was 72.8% (95% CI, 64.6-82.0), and the cumulative incidence of relapse was 13.0% (95% CI, 6.3-19.8). Patients with only negative or low-positive MRD levels during HR blocks had a significantly lower five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of 2.2% (95% CI, 0-6.6) compared with patients with one or more high-positive MRD levels (CIR 15.4%; 95% CI, 3.9-26.9). During the entire treatment protocol, 11.2% of patients died due to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The high survival with HR blocks seems favorable compared with other studies. However, the limit of treatment intensification might have been reached as the number of patients dying from leukemia relapse is about equal as the number of patients dying from toxicity. Patients with negative or low MRD levels during HR blocks have lower relapse rates.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['van Binsbergen, Annelien L', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester A', 'Fiocco, Marta F', 'Pieters, Rob']","['van Binsbergen AL', 'de Haas V', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'de Groot-Kruseman HA', 'Fiocco MF', 'Pieters R']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Leiden University, Mathematical Institute, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211014,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'pediatric', 'toxicity']",2021/10/15 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2021/10/14 12:32'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/14 12:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29387 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2022 Feb;69(2):e29387. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29387.

The discussion of each novel treatment or drug combination will include a brief overview of scientific rational and pre-clinical data, followed by recently published or ongoing clinical trial efforts. The review will be divided into three focus areas in CML treatment: new frontline approaches and approaches to deepen remission, second treatment-free remission studies, and the treatment of refractory disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The section on new frontline approaches will highlight several strategies of combination therapy. These can be grouped into immunomodulatory approaches with interferons and immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeting of leukemia stem cells with compounds such as venetoclax and pioglitazone, and BCR-ABL1-intrinsic combination therapy with asciminib. The chance at a second treatment-free remission is an important emerging clinical trial concept, and again combination approaches are under investigation. Lastly, in advanced disease, the development of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors remains a major focus. This review will provide an overview and perspective of treatment strategies on the horizon for chronic phase CML. Despite the already excellent clinical outcomes for most patients, challenges remain with regard to deepening initial responses, prolonging treatment-free remission, and providing efficacious and tolerable options for patients with refractory disease and resistance mutations.","['(c) 2021.

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures can provide valuable information to inform treatment decision-making. Here, we review pivotal studies that used PRO measures to evaluate HRQOL of patients with CML in the first-line and treatment-free remission (TFR), and identify areas for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: PRO measures commonly studied in patients with CML include the SF-36, FACT-Leu, EORTC QLQ-CML24, and MDASI CML. Cohort or cross-sectional studies provide the most data on PRO measures in patients with CML, with less information available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Patients with CML taking TKIs have worse HRQOL compared to matched controls, with a few studies seeing a larger effect in younger patients (< 60 years old). No single TKI consistently has better HRQOL compared to other agents. Fatigue is a predominant symptom associated with impaired HRQOL across many studies. Studies evaluating TFR show stable or improved HRQOL after TKI discontinuation. There are areas of HRQOL detrimental to patients with other types of cancer (e.g., cognition, sexuality) that warrant further evaluation in patients with CML. Understanding the HRQOL of patients with CML is increasingly important as patients live near-normal life expectancies. PRO measures have the potential to inform treatment decisions in this patient population. Future research opportunities include using PRO measures in RCTs and expanding the HRQOL topics studied in patients with CML.","['(c) 2021.

The dynamic interconversion of sphingolipids is tightly controlled at the level of enzymes and cellular compartments in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli, such as anticancer drugs, including retinoids. Over the past two decades, evidence emerged that retinoids owe part of their potency in cancer therapy to modulation of sphingolipid metabolism and ceramide generation. Ceramide has been proposed as a 'tumor-suppressor lipid' that orchestrates cell growth, cell cycle arrest, cell death, senescence, autophagy, and metastasis. There is accumulating evidence that cancer development is promoted by the dysregulation of tumor-promoting sphingolipids whereas cancer treatments can kill tumor cells by inducing the accumulation of endogenous ceramide levels. Resistance to cancer therapy may develop due to a disrupted equilibrium between the opposing roles of tumor-suppressor and tumor-promoter sphingolipids. Despite the undulating effect and complexity of sphingolipid pathways, there are emerging opportunities for a plethora of enzyme-targeted therapeutic interventions that overcome resistance resulting from perturbed sphingolipid pathways. Here, we have revisited the interconnectivity of sphingolipid metabolism and the instrumental role of ceramide-biosynthetic and degradative enzymes, including bioactive sphingolipid products, how they closely relate to cancer treatment and pathogenesis, and the interplay with retinoid signaling in cancer. We focused on retinoid targeting, alone or in combination, of sphingolipid metabolism nodes in cancer to enhance ceramide-based therapeutics. Retinoid and ceramide-based cancer therapy using novel strategies such as combination treatments, synthetic retinoids, ceramide modulators, and delivery formulations hold promise in the battle against cancer.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Little is known about the experiences of parent caregivers of children with a blood cancer during the diagnosis period and how families' needs may differ in light of the patient's developmental phase in the life span. Methods: We conducted semistructured in-depth interviews with 20 parent caregivers (aged 30-65) of children diagnosed with a blood cancer, recruited through The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's (LLS) constituency. Interview transcripts were thematically analyzed using the constant comparative method. To elucidate similarities and differences in caregiving experiences, findings were compared across parents with children diagnosed in three developmental periods: infancy-early childhood, age 0-6 (n = 9); pre-early adolescence, aged 9-14 (n = 5); and late adolescence-emerging adulthood, aged 16-27 (n = 6). Results: Across all developmental periods, parents described three similar caregiving experiences during the diagnosis period: being persistent to obtain a diagnosis, attending to the child's quality of life challenges, and attending to their other children's well-being. Among caregivers of younger children, persistence was motivated by parental intuition and challenges included coping with traumatic physical and psychological impacts of treatment procedures. For caregivers of late adolescents-early adults, persistence was motivated by the child's self-assessment and fertility-related concerns emerged. Conclusion: Results illustrate core issues for parent blood cancer caregivers and highlight ways to tailor supportive resources that facilitate good communication practices and shared decision-making to children's distinct developmental needs.",,"['Kastrinos, Amanda L', 'Bylund, Carma L', 'Mullis, Michaela D', 'Wollney, Easton', 'Sae-Hau, Maria', 'Weiss, Elisa', 'Fisher, Carla L']","['Kastrinos AL', 'Bylund CL', 'Mullis MD', 'Wollney E', 'Sae-Hau M', 'Weiss E', 'Fisher CL']","['Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, New York, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, New York, USA.', 'College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211012,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['caregiving', 'developmental differences', 'hematological malignancy', 'leukemia', 'life span', 'lymphoma', 'parent-child relationship']",2021/10/15 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2021/10/14 12:14'],"['2021/10/14 12:14 [entrez]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2021.0070 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Oct 12. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2021.0070.,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8571-355X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prospective studies of diagnostic accuracy and comparisons with conventional MRI are lacking. The aim of the current study was to evaluate, prospectively, the diagnostic accuracy of a previously established classifier for diagnosing the three major childhood cerebellar tumours, and to determine added value compared with standard reporting of conventional imaging. Single-voxel MRS (1.5 T, PRESS, TE 30 ms, TR 1500 ms, spectral resolution 1 Hz/point) was acquired prospectively on 39 consecutive cerebellar tumours with histopathological diagnoses of pilocytic astrocytoma, ependymoma or medulloblastoma. Spectra were analysed with LCModel and predefined quality control criteria were applied, leaving 33 cases in the analysis. The MRS diagnostic classifier was applied to this dataset. A retrospective analysis was subsequently undertaken by three radiologists, blind to histopathological diagnosis, to determine the change in diagnostic certainty when sequentially viewing conventional imaging, MRS and a decision support tool, based on the classifier. The overall classifier accuracy, evaluated prospectively, was 91%. Incorrectly classified cases, two anaplastic ependymomas, and a rare histological variant of medulloblastoma, were not well represented in the original training set. On retrospective review of conventional MRI, MRS and the classifier result, all radiologists showed a significant increase (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001) in their certainty of the correct diagnosis, between viewing the conventional imaging and MRS with the decision support system. It was concluded that MRS can aid the noninvasive diagnosis of posterior fossa tumours in children, and that a decision support classifier helps in MRS interpretation.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Several microRNAs and proteins can contribute to EMT modulation in cSCCs. MicroRNA21 and microRNA31 are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of protein expression and could play a relevant role in EMT and cSCC progression. Throughout the EMT process upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) enhances invasiveness and MMP-1 and MMP-3 contribute to local invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis in cSCCs. Additionally, cSCC development is associated with PTEN loss and NF-kappaB, NOTCH-1 and p63 activation. The aim of this work is to identify differences in the expression of those molecules between both pathways of cSCCs development. Eight tissue microarrays from 80 consecutive cSCCs were analyzed using LNA-based miRNA in situ hybridization for miRNA21 and miRNA31 evaluation, and immunohistochemistry for MMP-1, MMP-3, PTEN, NOTCH-1, NF-kappaB, p63 and CD31. Significantly higher expression of miRNA31 (p < 0.0001) and MMP-1 (p = 0.0072) and angiogenesis (p = 0.0199) were found in the differentiated pathway, whereas PTEN loss (p = 0.0430) was more marked in the classical pathway. No significant differences were found for the other markers. Our findings support a contribution of miRNA31 and MMP-1 in the differentiated pathway, associated to EMT and increased microvascularization. The greater PTEN loss in the classical pathway indicate that its relevance in cSCC is not EMT-related.","['(c) 2021.

Several factors can influence the yield of this process, and new mathematical models are needed to describe this complex phenomenon. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed immune reconstitution in the early post-HSCT period in a multicenter cohort of 206 pediatric patients affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome who received their first allo-HSCT. All patients were in complete morphological remission at transplantation and were followed-up at least 26 mo post-HSCT. Blood samples for analysis of lymphocyte subset numbers were collected at day 100 (+/-20 d). Results: The 2-y cumulative incidence of relapse was 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3-27). Using principal component analysis, we identified based on 16 input variables a new multivariate model that enables patients' description in a low-dimensional model, consisting of the first 2 principal components. We found that the numbers of CD3(+)/CD4(+)/CD8(+) lymphocyte subsets at day 100 post-HSCT and acute graft-versus-host disease had the greatest impact in preventing relapse. We ultimately derived a risk score defining high- or medium-low-risk groups with 2-y cumulative incidence of relapse: 35.3% (95% CI, 25.6-45) and 15.6% (95% CI, 10.1-20.7), respectively (P = 0.001*). Conclusions: Our model describes immune reconstitution and its main influencing factors in the early posttransplantation period, presenting as a reliable model for relapse risk prediction. If validated, this model could definitely serve as a predictive tool and could be used for clinical trials or for individualized patient counseling.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

The roles of RFWD2 in cancer are related to the targeting of its substrates for ubiquitination and degradation. This study aimed to investigate the role of TRIB2 in relation to the regulation of protein degradation through RFWD2. inBio Discover results demonstrated that TRIB2 can perform its functions by interacting with RFWD2 or other factors. TRIB2 can interact with and regulate RFWD2, which further attends the proteasome-mediated degradation of the RFWD2 substrate p-IkappaB-alpha. TRIB2 colocalizes with RFWD2-related IkappaB-alpha to form a ternary complex and further affects the IkappaB-alpha degradation by regulating its phosphorylation. Specific domain analysis showed that TRIB2 may bind to RFWD2 via its C-terminus, whereas it binds to IkappaB via its pseudokinase domain. TRIB2 acts as an oncogene and promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, whereas RFWD2 knockdown reversed the role of TRIB2 in promoting cancer cell growth and colony formation in vitro and in vivo. In summary, this study reveals that TRIB2 promotes the progression of cancer by affecting the proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins through the interaction with RFWD2.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hao, Hu, Liu, Liang, Li, Wang, Zhang, Wang, Li and Xie.']","['Hao, Ruimin', 'Hu, Jinxia', 'Liu, Yuemei', 'Liang, Dongmin', 'Li, Yan-Mei', 'Wang, Ranran', 'Zhang, Shucui', 'Wang, Pingyu', 'Li, You-Jie', 'Xie, Shuyang']","['Hao R', 'Hu J', 'Liu Y', 'Liang D', 'Li YM', 'Wang R', 'Zhang S', 'Wang P', 'Li YJ', 'Xie S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Immune Rheumatism, Yantaishan Hospital, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210927,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['RFWD2', 'TRIB2', 'cancer therapy', 'proteasome-mediated degradation', 'target gene']",2021/10/15 06:00,2021/10/15 06:01,['2021/10/14 06:38'],"['2021/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/14 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.733175 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 27;11:733175. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.733175. eCollection 2021.,11,,733175,,,PMC8503262,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 299 patients (299/332, 90.1%) had at least one oncogenic point mutation. In multivariable analyses, pretransplant disease status, minimal residual disease (MRD) before transplantation (pre-MRD), cytogenetic risk classification, and TP53 and FLT3-ITD (high ratio) mutations were independent risk factors for AML recurrence after allotransplantation (p < 0.05). A nomogram for the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) that integrated all the predictors in the multivariable model was then constructed, and the concordance index (C-index) values at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for CIR prediction were 0.754, 0.730, 0.715, and 0.690, respectively. Moreover, calibration plots showed good agreements between the actual observation and the nomogram prediction for the 6, 12, 18, and 24 months posttransplantation CIR in the internal validation. The integrated calibration index (ICI) values were 0.008, 0.055, 0.094, and 0.136 at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months posttransplantation, respectively. With a median cutoff score of 9.73 from the nomogram, all patients could be divided into two groups, and the differences in 2-year CIR, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) between these two groups were significant (p < 0.05). Taken together, the results of our study indicate that gene mutations could help to predict the outcomes of patients with AML receiving allotransplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Bao, Qiu, Tang, Han, Fu, Sun, Ruan, Wu, Chen and Xu.']","['Zhang, Tongtong', 'Bao, Xiebing', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Han, Yue', 'Fu, Chengcheng', 'Sun, Aining', 'Ruan, Changgeng', 'Wu, Depei', 'Chen, Suning', 'Xu, Yang']","['Zhang T', 'Bao X', 'Qiu H', 'Tang X', 'Han Y', 'Fu C', 'Sun A', 'Ruan C', 'Wu D', 'Chen S', 'Xu Y']","['Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Haematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Haematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Centre for Haematological Diseases, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Haematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210927,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant', 'cumulative incidence of relapse', 'gene mutation topography', 'predictive mutations']",2021/10/15 06:00,2021/10/15 06:01,['2021/10/14 06:38'],"['2021/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/14 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.732088 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 27;11:732088. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.732088. eCollection 2021.,11,,732088,,,PMC8503644,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, new prognostic markers are needed in order to allow treatment to be more accurate, providing better results and an improved quality of life. In the present study, we have characterized the profile of bone marrow soluble mediators as possible biomarkers for risk group stratification and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection during induction therapy. The study featured 47 newly-diagnosed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients that were categorized into subgroups during induction therapy according to risk stratification at day 15 [Low Risk (LR), Low Risk increasing to High Risk (LR-->HR) and High Risk (HR)] and the MRD detection on day 35 (MRD((-)) and MRD((+))). Soluble immunological mediators (CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL9, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-2) were quantified by cytometric bead array and ELISA. Our findings demonstrated that increased levels of CCL5, IFN-gamma and IL-2 at baseline appeared as putative candidates of good prognosis in LR and MRD((-)) subgroups, while CCL2 was identified as a consistent late biomarker associated with poor prognosis, which was observed on D35 in HR and MRD((+)) subgroups. Furthermore, apparently controversial data regarding IL-17A and TNF did not allow the definition of these molecules as either positive or negative biomarkers. These results contribute to the search for novel prognostic indicators, and indicate the potential of bone marrow soluble mediators in prognosis and follow-up of B-ALL patients during induction therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kerr, Magalhaes-Gama, Ibiapina, Hanna, Xabregas, Alves,', 'Pimentel, Carvalho, Tarrago, Teixeira-Carvalho, Martins-Filho, da Costa and', 'Malheiro.']","['Kerr, Marlon Wendell Athaydes', 'Magalhaes-Gama, Fabio', 'Ibiapina, Hiochelson Najibe Santos', 'Hanna, Fabiola Silva Alves', 'Xabregas, Lilyane Amorim', 'Alves, Eliana Brasil', 'Pimentel, Joao Paulo Diniz', 'Carvalho, Maria Perpetuo Socorro Sampaio', 'Tarrago, Andrea Monteiro', 'Teixeira-Carvalho, Andrea', 'Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis', 'da Costa, Allyson Guimaraes', 'Malheiro, Adriana']","['Kerr MWA', 'Magalhaes-Gama F', 'Ibiapina HNS', 'Hanna FSA', 'Xabregas LA', 'Alves EB', 'Pimentel JPD', 'Carvalho MPSS', 'Tarrago AM', 'Teixeira-Carvalho A', 'Martins-Filho OA', 'da Costa AG', 'Malheiro A']","['Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Aplicadas a Hematologia, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Instituto Rene Rachou -

Currently no multi-omics data set for primary MLL r patient cells exists that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics and glycomics to gain an inclusive picture of theranostic targets. Methods: We have integrated transcriptomics, proteomics and glycomics to i) obtain the first inclusive picture of primary patient BCP-ALL cells and identify molecular signatures that distinguish leukemic from normal precursor B-cells and ii) better understand the benefits and limitations of the applied technologies to deliver deep molecular sequence data across major cellular biopolymers. Results: MLL-r cells feature an extensive remodeling of their glycocalyx, with increased levels of Core 2-type O-glycans and complex N-glycans as well as significant changes in sialylation and fucosylation. Notably, glycosaminoglycan remodeling from chondroitin sulfate to heparan sulfate was observed. A survival screen, to determine if glycan remodeling enzymes are redundant, identified MGAT1 and NGLY1, essential components of the N-glycosylation/degradation pathway, as highly relevant within this in vitro screening. OGT and OGA, unique enzymes that regulate intracellular O-GlcNAcylation, were also indispensable. Transcriptomics and proteomics further identified Fes and GALNT7-mediated glycosylation as possible therapeutic targets. While there is overall good correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics data, we demonstrate that a systematic combined multi-omics approach delivers important diagnostic information that is missed when applying a single omics technology. Conclusions: Apart from confirming well-known MLL-r BCP-ALL glycoprotein markers, our integrated multi-omics workflow discovered previously unidentified diagnostic/therapeutic protein targets.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Oliveira, Tiago', 'Zhang, Mingfeng', 'Joo, Eun Ji', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Yang, Lu', 'Chou, Chih-Hsing', 'Qin, Xi', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Alagesan, Kathirvel', 'Almeida, Andreia', 'Jacob, Francis', 'Packer, Nicolle H', 'von Itzstein, Mark', 'Heisterkamp, Nora', 'Kolarich, Daniel']","['Oliveira T', 'Zhang M', 'Joo EJ', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Chen CW', 'Yang L', 'Chou CH', 'Qin X', 'Chen J', 'Alagesan K', 'Almeida A', 'Jacob F', 'Packer NH', 'von Itzstein M', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Kolarich D']","['Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, QLD, Australia.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, QLD, Australia.', 'Glyco-Oncology, Ovarian Cancer Research, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Griffith University, QLD and Macquarie University, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, QLD, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Griffith University, QLD and Macquarie University, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210921,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Glycomics', '*Leukemia', '*Proteomics', '*Transcriptomics', '*multi-omics']",2021/10/15 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2021/10/14 06:35'],"['2021/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/14 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.65398 [doi]', 'thnov11p9519 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2021 Sep 21;11(19):9519-9537. doi: 10.7150/thno.65398. eCollection 2021.,11,19,9519-9537,,,PMC8490503,"['R01 CA236399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK124116/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA243386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although p53 functions as a tumor suppressor, the associations between p53 status, autophagy, and MDR are complicated and conditional. Method: In this report, p53-null human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 and its MDR phenotype SKVCR and human leukemia cell line CEM and its MDR phenotype CEM-VLB) (p53 mutant cell line) were used. Results: Compared to parental SKOV3, the mRNA and protein levels of MAPLC3-II and Beclin1 were higher in SKVCR cells. The inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA significantly sensitized SKVCR to VCR. Conversely, in drug-resistant leukemic cells CEM-VLB, the expressions of Beclin1 and MAPLC3-II were lower than CEM. CEM and CEM-VLB cells were treated with VLB .01 or 0.5 mug/mL, respectively, and the expression of p53 and autophagy up-regulated after VLB (.01 mug/mL) treatment in CEM cells. The percentage of S-phase and G2/M phase cells up-regulated significantly by .01 mug/mL VLB in CEM, which may relate to the status of p53 of CEM cells. A combination of radiation with 3-MA significantly increased apoptosis in CEM-VLB cells.

However, it remains unclear whether this procedure is equally effective for certain groups of patients. To address this question, we analyzed 296 patients with APL who had undergone autologous HCT during second or subsequent complete remission (CR2+) between 2006 and 2019. Among them, 24 patients were >/=65 years old, and 17 underwent autologous HCT during third or subsequent CR. Of the 286 patients whose measurable residual disease (MRD) data were available, 21 showed detectable MRD. The 5-year probabilities of relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality for the entire cohort were 85%, 88%, 9%, and 6%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that the duration of first CR ( < or >/=2 years) was the sole factor associated with RFS (P = 0.002), but even those with CR1 duration <2 years showed a 5-year RFS of 76%. The other factors such as age, disease status, and MRD status were not predictive for the survival outcomes.

Combination chemotherapy is a successful approach to overcome these limitations. Here, we investigated the effects of pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARgamma agonist, and/or DOX on the viability, cell cycle, apoptosis on THP-1 cells and normal human monocytes (NHMs). METHODS: MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of DOX and/or PGZ. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction were examined by PI or Annexin V-PI double staining, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the changes in the mRNA expression of cell cycle progression or apoptosis-associated genes including P27, P21, CDK2, P53, BCL2 and FasR. RESULTS: DOX, PGZ and DOX + PGZ exerted their cytotoxic effects in a dose- and time-dependent manner with low toxicity on NHMs. The cell growth inhibitory effects of DOX were in association with G2/M arrest, while PGZ executed S phase arrest. PGZ treatment enhanced G2/M among DOX-treated combinations with moderate elevation in the S phase. DOX, PGZ and combined treatments induced apoptosis (mostly late phase) in a dose-dependent manner. All treatments resulted in the significant overexpression of p21, p27, p53 and FasR genes and downregulation of CDK2. DOX + PGZ combined treatments exhibited the most significant changes in mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the antiproliferative, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis-inducing capacity of DOX was enhanced by PGZ in THP-1 leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the combination of DOX + PGZ could be used as a novel combination to target AML.",,"['Ghasemi, Hassan', 'Jamshidi, Ali', 'Ghatee, Mohammad Amin', 'Mazhab-Jafari, Komeil', 'Khorasani, Milad', 'Rahmati, Mina', 'Mohammadi, Saeed']","['Ghasemi H', 'Jamshidi A', 'Ghatee MA', 'Mazhab-Jafari K', 'Khorasani M', 'Rahmati M', 'Mohammadi S']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Abadan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran.', 'Behbahan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Behbahan, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Abadan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran.', 'Metabolic Disorders Research Center, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211013,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'combination chemotherapy', 'doxorubicin', 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma)', 'pioglitazone']",2021/10/15 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2021/10/14 05:25'],"['2021/10/14 05:25 [entrez]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10799893.2021.1988972 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2021 Oct 13:1-10. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2021.1988972.,,,1-10,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7809-2732', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8615-0004', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6325-038X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4032-8452', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8204-5872', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1151-2437', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9895-8468']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis is based on a detailed and thorough history including progression of the disease, its response to previous therapy, involvement of other animals or people, and the cats' environment. Physical examination of both the skin and the body, as a whole, is essential because feline pododermatoses are often associated with systemic disease such as feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodefiency virus (FIV) and diabetes mellitus. Laboratory tests include skin scrapings, Wood's light examination, fungal culture, lesion smears, and skin biopsy. The latter is often the key to the diagnosis of feline pododermatoses. Other tests may include the intradermal skin test, patch testing and evaluation of endocrine function. Successful therapy of feline pododermatoses is dependent upon obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Resume- Les pododermatites sont peu frequentes chez le chat. Le diagnostic repose sur une anamnese soignee comprenant l'evolution de la maldie, sa reponse aux traitements anterieurs l'atteinte d'autres animaux on de personnes et l'environnement du chat. L'examen clinique, de la peau et de l'enseble du corps comme un tout, est essentiel, les pododermatites felines etant souvent associees a des maladies generales telles que le FeLV, le FIV ou le diabete sucre. Les examens complementaires comportent des raclages cutanes, un examen a la lampe de Wood, une culture fongique, des caiques des lesions et des biopsies. Cette derriere est souvent la clef du diagnostic d'une pododermatite feline. Les autres examens complementaires peuvent etre des intradermopreactions, des tests epicutanes et des tests hormonaux. Le succes du traitement d'une pododermatite feline depend de la possibilite d'etablir un diagnostic definitif. Zusammenfassung- Pododermatitis bei Katzen ist selten. DieDiagnose beruht auf einer detaillierten und sorgfaltig erhobenen Anamnese einschliesslich des Verlaufs der Erkrankung, ihrem Ansprechen auf bereits durchgefuhrte Therapien, die Erkrankung weiterer Tiere oder Menschen sowie Angaben uber die Lebensumstande der Katze. Die klinische Untersuchungen von Haut und dem Korper als Ganzes ist ein wesentlicher Punkt, da feline Pododermatosen oft mit systemischen Erkrankungen wie FeLV, FIV und Diabetes mellitus vergesellschaftet sind. Laboruntersuchungen schliessben Hautgeschabsel, Untersuchungen mit der Wood-Lampe, Pilzkultur, Abklatschpraparate, der Hautveranderungen und Hautbiopsien mit ein. Letztere sind oft der Schlussel zur Diagnose der felinen Pododermatitis. Andere diagnostische Methoden konnen intradermale Hauttests, Patchtests und uberprufung endokriner Organfunktionene beinhalten. Die erfolgreiche Behandlung der felinen Pododermatitis hangt davon ab, ob eine definitive Diagnose erstellt werden kann. Resumen Pododermatosis es un hallazgo infrequente en el gato. El diagnostico se basa en una historia detallada y completa incluyendo el curso de la enfermedad, respuesta a la terapia instaurada, si ha afectado a otros animales o personas, y el medio ambiente que rodea al gato.

However, there is controversy regarding the role of HCT following remission attainment. We evaluated the effect of consolidative HCT on leukemia-free survival (LFS) in pediatric and young adult subjects following CD19 CAR T cell induced remission. We evaluated the effect of consolidative HCT on LFS in pediatric and young adult subjects treated with a 41BB-CD19 CAR T cell product on a phase 1/2 trial, Pediatric and Young Adult Leukemia Adoptive Therapy (PLAT)-02 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02028455), using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards statistical model. Fifty of 64 subjects enrolled in PLAT-02 phase 1 and early phase 2 were evaluated, excluding 14 subjects who did not achieve remission, relapsed, or died before day 63 post-CAR T cell therapy. An improved LFS (P = .01) was observed in subjects who underwent consolidative HCT after CAR T cell therapy versus watchful waiting. Consolidative HCT improved LFS specifically in subjects who had no prior history of HCT, with a trend toward significance (P = .09). This benefit was not evident when restricted to the cohort of 34 subjects with a history of prior HCT (P = .45). However, for subjects who had CAR T cell functional persistence of 63 days or less, inclusive of those with a history of prior HCT, HCT significantly improved LFS outcomes (P = .01). These data support the use of consolidative HCT following CD19 CAR T cell-induced remission for patients with no prior history of HCT and those with short functional CAR T cell persistence.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, information on the frequency and time of onset of secondary hematological malignancies and the risk of hematological malignancy with different drugs is scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with solid tumors, including breast, colon, gastric, pancreatic, small cell lung, non-small cell lung, esophageal, ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. METHODS: Using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, we analyzed the reporting rates, reporting odds ratios, and the reporting onset times of secondary leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome for each drug used. RESULTS: The leukemia reporting rates were higher in breast, small cell lung, ovarian, and endometrial cancers than in other cancers, and the myelodysplastic syndrome reporting rates were higher in ovarian and endometrial cancers than in other cancers. For each cancer type, the reporting odds ratios of cytocidal anticancer agents, such as taxanes, anthracyclines, alkylating agents, platinum, and topoisomerase inhibitors, were higher than those of other drugs. Alternatively, the reporting odds ratios of molecular targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors were not higher than those of other drugs. Approximately half of the cases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were reported within 1 to 4 years after chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study clarified the risks of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome for several anticancer drugs in patients with solid tumors.

METHODS: P9404 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma [ALL]), P9425 and P9426 (Hodgkin lymphoma), P9754 (osteosarcoma), and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 95-01 (ALL) enrolled 1308 patients between 1996 and 2001: 1066 were randomized (1:1) to doxorubicin with or without dexrazoxane, and 242 (from P9754) were nonrandomly assigned to receive dexrazoxane. Trial data were linked with the National Death Index, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), and Medicaid. Osteosarcoma survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS; n = 495; no dexrazoxane) served as comparators in subanalyses. Follow-up events were assessed with cumulative incidence, Cox regression, and Fine-Gray methods. RESULTS: In randomized trials (cumulative prescribed doxorubicin dose, 100-360 mg/m(2) ; median follow-up, 18.6 years), dexrazoxane was not associated with relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-1.13), second cancers (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.62-2.30), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.78-1.47), or cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.41-5.16). Among P9754 patients (all exposed to dexrazoxane; cumulative doxorubicin, 450-600 mg/m(2) ; median follow-up, 16.6-18.4 years), no cardiovascular deaths or heart transplantation occurred. The 20-year heart transplantation rate among CCSS osteosarcoma survivors (mean doxorubicin, 377 +/- 145 mg/m(2) ) was 1.6% (vs 0% in P9754; P = .13). Among randomized patients, serious cardiovascular outcomes (cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, and stroke) ascertained by PHIS/Medicaid occurred less commonly with dexrazoxane (5.6%) than without it (17.6%; P = .02), although cardiomyopathy rates alone did not differ (4.4% vs 8.1%; P = .35).

Myeloid neoplasms (MN) with germline predisposition was identified as a distinct category in the 2016 WHO classification revision, including MN with germline DDX41 mutation. We retrospectively analyzed the molecular findings and clinical characteristics of thirty-three DDX41-mutated (mDDX41) patients at our institution. We identified 14 distinct pathogenic DDX41 variants in 32 patients and 8 DDX41 variants of unknown significance (VUS) in 9 patients. Five (16%) patients had a second DDX41 somatic mutation p.R525H and 13 (40%) had at least one additional oncogenic co-mutation in other genes. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 66 years, with male predominance (72%) and the majority of patients had normal cytogenetics (91%). Two-year overall survival (OS) was 86% and 6 (21%) MDS/AML patients with relatively preserved hematopoietic function were observed without further intervention. In comparison to AML patients with prognostically more favorable subtypes [t(8;21), n=27 and inv(16), n=40], mDDX41 patients in our cohort showed similarly favorable OS.

These observations suggest that targeting alternative dysregulated signaling pathways may provide therapeutic benefit. Previous studies identified NFvarkappaB pathway hyperactivation in myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) that was insensitive to JAK2 inhibition. Here, we provide evidence that NFvarkappaB pathway inhibition via pevonedistat targets malignant cells in MPN patient samples as well as in MPN and patient-derived xenograft mouse models that is non-redundant with ruxolitinib. Colony forming assays revealed preferential inhibition of MF colony growth compared to normal colony formation. In mass cytometry studies, pevonedistat blunted canonical TNFalpha responses in MF and sAML patient CD34+ cells. Pevonedistat also inhibited hyperproduction of inflammatory cytokines more effectively than ruxolitinib. Upon pevonedistat treatment alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, MPN mouse models exhibited reduced disease burden and improved survival. These studies demonstrating efficacy of pevonedistat in MPN cells in vitro as well as in vivo provide a rationale for therapeutic inhibition of NFvarkappaB signaling for MF treatment.

Via integrating in-house tissue microarrays, gene chips, and RNA-sequencing data, we explored the expression and clinical value of BNC1 in OV. Immunohistochemical staining was utilized to confirm the protein expression status of BNC1. A combined SMD of -2.339 (95% CI: -3.649 to -1.028, P < 0.001) identified that BNC1 was downregulated based on 1346 samples, and the sROC (AUC = 0.93) showed a favorable discriminatory ability of BNC1 in OV patients. We used univariate and multivariate Cox regulation to evaluate the prognostic role of BNC1 for OV patients, and a combined hazard ratio of 0.717 (95% CI: 0.445-0.989, P < 0.001) revealed that BNC1 was a protective factor for OV. Furthermore, the fraction of infiltrating naive B cells, memory B cells, and other immune cells showed statistical differences between the high- and low-BNC1 expression groups through cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. Enrichment analysis showed that BNC1 may have a relationship with immune-related items in OV. By predicting the potential regulatory transcription factors (TFs) of BNC1, friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) may be a potential upstream TF of BNC1. Corporately, a decreasing trend of BNC1 may serve as a tumor suppressor and prognostic biomarker in OV patients.

Because H3.3G34R/V mutations reprogram epigenetic modifications, we undertook a comprehensive epigenetic approach using ChIP sequencing and ChromHMM computational analysis to define therapeutic dependencies in H3.3G34R/V gliomas. Our analyses revealed a convergence of epigenetic alterations, including (i) activating epigenetic modifications on histone H3 lysine (K) residues such as H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), and H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3); (ii) DNA promoter hypomethylation; and (iii) redistribution of repressive histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to intergenic regions at the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) locus to drive increased LIF abundance and secretion by H3.3G34R/V cells. LIF activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in an autocrine/paracrine manner to promote survival of H3.3G34R/V glioma cells. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing from H3.3G34R/V patient tumors revealed high STAT3 protein and RNA expression, respectively, in tumor cells with both inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. We targeted STAT3 using a blood-brain barrier-penetrable small-molecule inhibitor, WP1066, currently in clinical trials for adult gliomas. WP1066 treatment resulted in H3.3G34R/V tumor cell toxicity in vitro and tumor suppression in preclinical mouse models established with KNS42 cells, SJ-HGGx42-c cells, or in utero electroporation techniques. Our studies identify the LIF/STAT3 pathway as a key epigenetically driven and druggable vulnerability in H3.3G34R/V gliomas.

The superfamily of tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein family is among the biggest recognized single protein RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases that are considered vital carcinogenesis regulators, which is not shocking since TRIM proteins are engaged in various biological processes, including cell growth, development, and differentiation; hence, TRIM proteins' alterations may influence apoptosis, cell proliferation, and transcriptional regulation. In this review article, the various mechanisms through which TRIM proteins exert their role in the most prevalent malignancies including lung, prostate, colorectal, liver, breast, brain cancer, and leukemia are summarized.","['(c) 2021.

We reviewed the medical records of 58 children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at our hospital to evaluate initial features. Forty six of these patients had hematological symptoms, anemia, or hemorrhage (Group H), while 12 patients had prominent musculoskeletal pain without hematological symptoms (Group P). Diagnosis of leukemia took significantly more time for those 12 patients (Group H, 17.1 days; Group P, 48.5 days). In three of the 12 patients in Group P, localized abnormal imaging findings and unremarkable blood test results led to initial diagnoses of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, bone fracture, and septic osteomyelitis. However, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) revealed multiple intense bone foci or systemic bone marrow uptake, leading to the diagnosis of ALL. A review of 18F-FDG-PET results from 23 patients with ALL who underwent a PET scan (Group H, n = 15; Group P, n = 8) showed multiple bone foci or systemic bone marrow uptake in all cases.

This study used three population-based data in Taiwan, the National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan Cancer Registry, and National Death Registry, between 2001 and 2015, to investigate the effect of conventional chemotherapy (CCT) versus non-conventional chemotherapy (NCCT) on the overall survival (OS) of patients with AML (n = 7,763). Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of different treatments on the risk of mortality. To reduce the potential selection bias, we used the inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the propensity score to balance the baseline characteristics between patients receiving CCT and NCCT. The median survival time for CCT and NCCT arms was 10.2 months (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 9.7-10.9) and 4.1 months (95% CI: 3.8-4.5), respectively. Compared to the patients received NCCT, those receiving CCT had a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.59-0.67, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that CCT did benefit patients in different gender, age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status (SES) groups. In conclusion, the real-world population-based data exhibited CCT were more likely to be prescribed for patients with AML of younger age, fewer comorbidities, diagnosed recently (2011-2015), and higher SES. In fact, CCT had better treatment outcomes than NCCT in terms of OS for adult patients diagnosed with AML.","['(c) 2021.

However, these findings may be related to the underlying maternal infection. This multinational study aimed to investigate the association between prenatal nitrofurantoin exposure and childhood leukaemia while accounting for maternal infection. METHODS: In a population-based cohort study of children born in Denmark, Finland, Norway or Sweden from 1997 to 2013, prenatal exposure to nitrofurantoin or pivmecillinam (active comparator) was ascertained from national Prescription Registries. Childhood leukaemia was identified by linkage to national Cancer Registries. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with inverse probability of treatment weights applied to account for confounding. RESULTS: We included 44 091 children prenatally exposed to nitrofurantoin and 247 306 children prenatally exposed to pivmecillinam. The children were followed for 9.3 years on average (standard deviation 4.1). There were 161 cases of childhood leukaemia. The weighted IRR for prenatal nitrofurantoin exposure when compared with pivmecillinam was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.88, 2.06), corresponding to an IRD of 15 per million person-years. Higher point estimates were seen for first- and third-trimester exposure. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to nitrofurantoin was not substantially associated with childhood leukaemia, although a slightly elevated IRR with confidence intervals including the null was observed, corresponding to a small absolute risk. The lack of a dose-response relationship and a clear biological mechanism to explain the findings suggests against a causal association.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Elderly patients with comorbidities and poor performance status (PS) receive treatment with hypomethylating agents or supportive care. Several models are available to predict treatment-related mortality and they all primarily focus on PS. Little is known about the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on survival in elderly patients with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 81 patients (51.9% male) aged over 65 years when the diagnosis of AML was established. The median observation period lasted 108 days (IQR 292, maximum 1,169). Patients' documentation was examined for previous illnesses, PS was calculated, basic laboratory blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy were done. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2). RESULTS: The median age of patients was 75 years (IQR 14, maximum 93). The mean eGFR was 59.5 +/- 24.0 mL/min/1.73m(2). CKD was present in almost half of patients (49.4%). Altogether, 69 (85.2%) patients died during the observation period. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed statistically lower survival for CKD patients (log-rank chi2 = 6.736; p = 0.009). Cox regression model, adjusted for age, comorbidities, and treatment, revealed the main predictors for patient survival to be PS, AML type, and blast percentage.

Machine learning (ML) methods rapidly classify multidimensional data and should dramatically improve the efficiency of FC data analysis. We aimed to build a model to classify acute leukemias, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and distinguish them from nonneoplastic cytopenias. We also sought to illustrate a method to identify key FC parameters that contribute to the model's performance. METHODS: Using data from 531 patients who underwent evaluation for cytopenias and/or acute leukemia, we developed an ML model to rapidly distinguish among APL, acute myeloid leukemia/not APL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and nonneoplastic cytopenias. Unsupervised learning using gaussian mixture model and Fisher kernel methods were applied to FC listmode data, followed by supervised support vector machine classification. RESULTS: High accuracy (ACC, 94.2%; area under the curve [AUC], 99.5%) was achieved based on the 37-parameter FC panel. Using only 3 parameters, however, yielded similar performance (ACC, 91.7%; AUC, 98.3%) and highlighted the significant contribution of light scatter properties. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the potential for ML to automatically identify and prioritize FC specimens that have critical results, including APL and other acute leukemias.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

While a rapid automated quantification of the regular blood cells is available, recognition and counting of immature white blood cells (WBC) still relies mostly on the microscopic examination of blood smears by an experienced observer. Recently, there are efforts to improve the prediction by various machine learning approaches. An open dataset collection including the recently digitalized single-cell images for 200 patients, from peripheral blood smears at 100 x magnification, was used. We studied different morphological, fractal, and textural descriptors for WBC classification, with an aim to indicate the most reliable parameters for the recognition of certain cell types. Structural properties of both the mature and non-mature leukocytes obtained from (i) acute myeloid leukemia patients, or (ii) non-malignant controls, were studied in depth, with a sample size of about 25 WBC per group. We quantified structural and textural differences and, based on the statistical ranges of parameters for different WBC types, selected eight features for classification: Cell area, Nucleus-to-cell ratio, Nucleus solidity, Fractal dimension, Correlation, Contrast, Homogeneity, and Energy. Classification Precision of up to 100% (80% on average) was achieved.","[""(c) 2021.

Several authors have reported increased risk of leukemia and brain tumors associated with radiation exposure from CT scans. However, reverse causation is a concern, particularly for brain cancer; in other words, the CT scan may have been taken because of preexisting cancer and therefore not have been a cause. We assessed the possibility of reverse causation via a simulation study focused on brain tumors, using a simplified version of the data structure for recent CT studies. Five-year-lagged and unlagged analyses implied an observed excess risk per scan up to 70% lower than the true excess risk per scan, particularly when more than 10% of persons with latent cancer had increased numbers of scans or the extra scanning rate after development of latent cancer was greater than 2 scans/year; less extreme values of these parameters imply little risk attenuation. Without a lag and when more than 20% of persons with latent cancer had increased scans-an arguably implausible scenario-the excess risk per scan was increased over the true excess risk per scan by up to 35%-40%. This study suggests that with a realistic lag, reverse causation results in downwardly biased risk, a result of induced classical measurement error, and is therefore unlikely to produce a spurious positive association between cancer and radiation dose from CT scans.","['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg', 'School of Public Health 2021.

High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles (PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158 approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay.

HSPCs in the leukemic bone marrow have limited genetic relatedness and share few somatic mutations with the cell-of-origin of the malignant blasts, suggesting polyclonal hematopoiesis in pAML patients.

The major cause of treatment failure is antigen downregulation or loss. Dual antigen targeting could potentially prevent this, but the clinical safety and efficacy of CAR T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 remain unclear. We conducted a phase 1 trial in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL (n = 15) to test AUTO3, autologous transduced T cells expressing both anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CARs (AMELIA trial, EUDRA CT 2016-004680-39). The primary endpoints were the incidence of grade 3-5 toxicity in the dose-limiting toxicity period and the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints included the rate of morphological remission (complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) with minimal residual disease-negative response, as well as the frequency and severity of adverse events, expansion and persistence of AUTO3, duration of B cell aplasia, and overall and event-free survival. The study endpoints were met. AUTO3 showed a favorable safety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities or cases of AUTO3-related severe cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity reported. At 1 month after treatment the remission rate (that is, complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) was 86% (13 of 15 patients). The 1 year overall and event-free survival rates were 60% and 32%, respectively. Relapses were probably due to limited long-term AUTO3 persistence. Strategies to improve CAR T cell persistence are needed to fully realize the potential of dual targeting CAR T cell therapy in B-ALL.",['(c) 2021.

In the present study, an imipridone, ONC201, was combined with RG7112, an antagonist of MDM2, a p53 negative regulator, to activate downstream events of the p53 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/death receptor (DR) pathways. As compared to treatment with the individual drugs, the combination of ONC201 and RG7112 promoted greater degrees of apoptosis of MF CD34(+) cells through activation of both p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Importantly, treatment with ONC201-RG7112 not only decreased the number of JAK2V617F(+) and calreticulin mutated colonies assayed from MF CD34(+) cells, but allowed for the persistence or appearance of JAK2 wild type colonies.

They can cause the development of AML at an earlier age, confer a higher risk of relapse or predispose to secondary leukemias, including therapy-related leukemias. The analysis of germline mutations in a patient and his/her family is also critical for the selection of suitable family donors if the patient is a candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: 103 unrelated consecutive patients with de novo AML were enrolled in the study. Control group consisted of 103 persons from the general population. We performed NGS sequencing of bone marrow cells and buccal swabs DNA of six genes: CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6, TERT, GATA2, and IDH2 to detect germline pathogenic mutations. RESULTS: In the investigated group, 49 variants were detected in six genes. 26 of them were somatic and 23 germline. Germline variants were detected in all six tested genes. Eight pathogenic germline mutations were detected in 7 AML patients, in three genes: CEBPA, ETV6, and IDH2. One patient had two pathogenic germinal mutations, one in ETV6 and one in CEBPA gene. We identified one novel pathogenic germline mutation in CEBPA gene. The difference in frequency of all pathogenic germline mutations between the tested (7.77 %) and control groups (0.97 %) was statistically significant (p = 0.046). In the tested group, the median age at AML diagnosis was 11 years lower in patients with pathogenic germline mutations than in patients without them (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: We showed higher frequency of CEBPA, ETV6, and IDH2 germline mutations in AML patients than in control group, which confirms the role of these mutations in the development of AML. We also showed that the median age at the onset of AML in patients with pathogenic germline mutations is significantly lower than in patients without them.",['(c) 2021.

Hence, SAMHD1 inhibitors are promising candidates for the sensitisation of leukaemia cells to nucleoside analogue-based therapy. Here, we investigated the effects of the cytosine analogue CNDAC, which has been proposed to be a SAMHD1 inhibitor, in the context of SAMHD1. METHODS: CNDAC was tested in 13 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines, in 26 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cell lines, ten AML sublines adapted to various antileukaemic drugs, 24 single cell-derived clonal AML sublines, and primary leukaemic blasts from 24 AML patients. Moreover, 24 CNDAC-resistant sublines of the AML cell lines HL-60 and PL-21 were established. The SAMHD1 gene was disrupted using CRISPR/Cas9 and SAMHD1 depleted using RNAi, and the viral Vpx protein. Forced DCK expression was achieved by lentiviral transduction. SAMHD1 promoter methylation was determined by PCR after treatment of genomic DNA with the methylation-sensitive HpaII endonuclease. Nucleoside (analogue) triphosphate levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. CNDAC interaction with SAMHD1 was analysed by an enzymatic assay and by crystallisation. RESULTS: Although the cytosine analogue CNDAC was anticipated to inhibit SAMHD1, SAMHD1 mediated intrinsic CNDAC resistance in leukaemia cells. Accordingly, SAMHD1 depletion increased CNDAC triphosphate (CNDAC-TP) levels and CNDAC toxicity. Enzymatic assays and crystallisation studies confirmed CNDAC-TP to be a SAMHD1 substrate. In 24 CNDAC-adapted acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) sublines, resistance was driven by DCK (catalyses initial nucleoside phosphorylation) loss. CNDAC-adapted sublines displayed cross-resistance only to other DCK substrates (e.g. cytarabine, decitabine). Cell lines adapted to drugs not affected by DCK or SAMHD1 remained CNDAC sensitive. In cytarabine-adapted AML cells, increased SAMHD1 and reduced DCK levels contributed to cytarabine and CNDAC resistance. CONCLUSION: Intrinsic and acquired resistance to CNDAC and related nucleoside analogues are driven by different mechanisms. The lack of cross-resistance between SAMHD1/ DCK substrates and non-substrates provides scope for next-line therapies after treatment failure.",['(c) 2021.

The causes of acute leukaemias are still poorly understood. The established risk factors are age, ionizing radiation or Downs syndrome. Moreover, a number of potential risk factors have been described to play a role in development of acute leukaemias and to multiply the risk, such as physical factors, chemicals, genetic and familial predispositions or other diseases.

STL1, was able to reduce Ser473 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that the flavonoid quercetin downregulated the phosphorylated and active form of AKT. However, in this case, quercetin inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway by directly binding the kinases CK2 and PI3K. In the present work, we investigated the antiproliferative effects of the co-treatment quercetin plus STL1 in HG-3 cells, derived from a patient affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Quercetin and STL1 in the mono-treatment maintained the capacity to inhibit AKT phosphorylation on Ser473, but did not significantly reduce cell viability. On the contrary, they activated a protective form of autophagy. When the HG-3 cells were co-treated with quercetin and STL1, their association synergistically (combination index < 1) inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis. The combined treatment caused the switch from protective to non-protective autophagy. This work demonstrated that cytotoxicity could be enhanced in a drug-resistant cell line by combining the effects of different inhibitors acting in concert on PI3K and AKT kinases.",,"['Cervellera, Carmen', 'Russo, Maria', 'Dotolo, Serena', 'Facchiano, Angelo', 'Russo, Gian Luigi']","['Cervellera C', 'Russo M', 'Dotolo S', 'Facchiano A', 'Russo GL']","['National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100 Avellino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210925,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT inhibitor', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'quercetin']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/10/13 01:14'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules26195810 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules26195810 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2021 Sep 25;26(19). pii: molecules26195810. doi: 10.3390/molecules26195810.,26,19,,20211112,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC8510450,"['FOE-2019, DSB.AD004.271/Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7077-4912', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9321-1613']","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity of co-treatments of doxorubicin (Dox) or idarubicin (Ida) at concentrations of the IC10-IC80 values and each concentration of Cur at the IC20, IC30, IC40, and IC50 values (conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4) was determined by MTT assays. Dox-Cur increased cytotoxicity in leukemic cells. Dox-Cur co-treatment showed additive and synergistic effects in several conditions. The effect of this co-treatment on FLT3 expression in KG-1a, KG-1, and EoL-1 cells was examined by Western blotting.

The objectives of this retrospective study were to elucidate the toxicity profile associated with asparaginase in children and adolescents with ALL, to analyze the impact of each type of toxicity on long-term outcomes, and to identify risk factors. We analyzed the medical charts of 165 patients diagnosed with ALL at Sf. Maria Iasi Children's Hospital from 2010 to 2019 and treated according to a chemotherapeutic protocol containing asparaginase. The median duration of follow-up was 5 years (0.1-11.5 years). Groups of patients with specific types of toxicity were compared to groups of patients without toxicity. We found the following incidence of asparaginase-associated toxicity: 24.1% clinical hypersensitivity, 19.4% hepatotoxicity, 6.7% hypertriglyceridemia, 4.2% hyperglycemia, 3.7% osteonecrosis, 3% pancreatitis, 2.4% thrombosis, and 1.2% cerebral thrombosis. Overall, 82 patients (49.7%) had at least one type of toxicity related to asparaginase. No type of toxicity had a significant impact on overall survival or event-free survival. Being older than 14 years was associated with a higher risk of osteonecrosis (p = 0.015) and hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.043) and a lower risk of clinical hypersensitivity (p = 0.04).

The epidemiologic literature has been systematically reviewed focusing on workers, general population, and pediatric population. A weak increase in leukemia risk due to Rn exposure was found, but bias and confounding factors cannot be ruled out. The results of studies conducted on stomach cancer are mixed, although with some prevalence for a positive association with Rn exposure. In the case of brain and CNS cancer and skin cancer, results are inconclusive, while no association was found for breast and kidney cancers. Overall, the available evidence does not support a conclusion that a causal association has been established between Rn exposure and the risk of other non-pulmonary neoplasms mainly due to the limited number and heterogeneity of existing studies.

ZNF521, a transcription co-factor implicated in the control of hematopoiesis, has been proposed to sustain leukemic transformation in collaboration with other oncogenes. Here, we demonstrate that ZNF521 mRNA levels correlate with specific genetic aberrations: in particular, the highest expression is observed in AMLs bearing MLL rearrangements, while the lowest is detected in AMLs with FLT3-ITD, NPM1, or CEBPalpha double mutations. In cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells, enforced expression of ZNF521 provides a significant proliferative advantage and enhances MLL-AF9 effects on the induction of proliferation and the expansion of leukemic progenitor cells. Transcriptome analysis of primary CD34(+) cultures displayed subsets of genes up-regulated by MLL-AF9 or ZNF521 single transgene overexpression as well as in MLL-AF9/ZNF521 combinations, at either the early or late time points of an in vitro leukemogenesis model. The silencing of ZNF521 in the MLL-AF9 + THP-1 cell line coherently results in an impairment of growth and clonogenicity, recapitulating the effects observed in primary cells. Taken together, these results underscore a role for ZNF521 in sustaining the self-renewal of the immature AML compartment, most likely through the perturbation of the gene expression landscape, which ultimately favors the expansion of MLL-AF9-transformed leukemic clones.",,"['Chiarella, Emanuela', 'Aloisio, Annamaria', 'Scicchitano, Stefania', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Cosentino, Emanuela G', 'Lico, Daniela', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Amodio, Nicola', 'Bond, Heather Mandy', 'Mesuraca, Maria']","['Chiarella E', 'Aloisio A', 'Scicchitano S', 'Todoerti K', 'Cosentino EG', 'Lico D', 'Neri A', 'Amodio N', 'Bond HM', 'Mesuraca M']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', ""Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Exiris S.r.l., 00128 Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, 9712 CP Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', ""Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211006,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'chromosomal translocations', 'cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells (CB-CD34+)', 'fusion gene MLL-AF9', 'gene expression', 'human zinc finger protein 521 (hZNF521)', 'mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) AF9 (MLLT3 or LTG9)']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/10/13 01:05'],"['2021/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms221910814 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms221910814 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Oct 6;22(19). pii: ijms221910814. doi: 10.3390/ijms221910814.,22,19,,20211025,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC8509509,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8314-715X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3566-7214', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3611-5649', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4033-2985', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5455-168X']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (zinc finger protein 521, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer, its occurrence is observed in only 5-10% of de novo AML, and in 30% of therapy related AML (t-AML). TP53 mutation serves as a prognostic marker of poor response to standard-of-care chemotherapy, particularly in t-AML and AML with complex cytogenetics. In light of a poor response to traditional chemotherapy and only a modest improvement in outcome with hypomethylation-based interventions, allogenic stem cell transplant is routinely recommended in these cases, albeit with a response that is often short lived. Despite being frequently mutated across the cancer spectrum, progress and enthusiasm for the development of p53 targeted therapeutic interventions is lacking and to date there is no approved drug that mitigates the effects of TP53 mutation. There is a mounting body of evidence indicating that p53 mutants differ in functionality and form from typical AML cases and subsequently display inconsistent responses to therapy at the cellular level. Understanding this pathobiological activity is imperative to the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of TP53 on the hematopoietic system, to describe its varying degree of functionality in tumor suppression, and to illustrate the need for the adoption of personalized therapeutic strategies to target distinct classes of the p53 mutation in AML management.",,"['George, Binsah', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Krocker, Joseph Douglas', 'Rios, Adan']","['George B', 'Kantarjian H', 'Baran N', 'Krocker JD', 'Rios A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Health Science-Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center-Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center-Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Health Science-Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Health Science-Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211005,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['TP53 mutations', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clonal hematopoiesis', 'variable allele frequency']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/10/13 01:05'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms221910782 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms221910782 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Oct 5;22(19). pii: ijms221910782. doi: 10.3390/ijms221910782.,22,19,,20211025,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",PMC8509740,['T32 GM008792/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0618-4798'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hedgehog (HH) pathway is important for leukemic transformation because of aberrant activation of GLI transcription factors. MBZ is a well-tolerated anthelmintic that exhibits strong antitumor effects. Herein, we show that MBZ induced strong, dose-dependent anti-leukemic effects on AML cells, including the sensitization of AML cells to chemotherapy with cytarabine. MBZ strongly reduced intracellular protein levels of GLI1/GLI2 transcription factors. Consequently, MBZ reduced the GLI promoter activity as observed in luciferase-based reporter assays in AML cell lines. Further analysis revealed that MBZ mediates its anti-leukemic effects by promoting the proteasomal degradation of GLI transcription factors via inhibition of HSP70/90 chaperone activity.

Mouse models of high risk (HR)-MDS and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) post-MDS using mutant NRAS and overexpression of human BCL-2, known to be poor prognostic indicators of the human diseases, were created. We have reported the efficacy of the BCL-2 inhibitor, ABT-737, on the AML post-MDS model; here, we report that this BCL-2 inhibitor also significantly extended survival of the HR-MDS mouse model, with reductions of BM blasts and lineage negative/Sca1+/KIT+ (LSK) cells. Secondary transplants showed increased survival in treated compared to untreated mice. Unlike the AML model, BCL-2 expression and RAS activity decreased following treatment and the RAS:BCL-2 complex remained in the plasma membrane. Exon-specific gene expression profiling (GEP) of HR-MDS mice showed 1952 differentially regulated genes upon treatment, including genes important for the regulation of stem cells, differentiation, proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis; relevant in human disease. Spliceosome genes, found to be abnormal in MDS patients and downregulated in our HR-MDS model, such as Rsrc1 and Wbp4, were upregulated by the treatment, as were genes involved in epigenetic regulation, such as DNMT3A and B, upregulated upon disease progression and downregulated upon treatment.",,"['Gorombei, Petra', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Ganesan, Saravanan', 'Chiquet, Mathieu', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Goursaud, Laure', 'Tekin, Nilgun', 'Beurlet, Stephanie', 'Patel, Satyananda', 'Guerenne, Laura', 'Le Pogam, Carole', 'Setterblad, Niclas', 'de la Grange, Pierre', 'LeBoeuf, Christophe', 'Janin, Anne', 'Noguera, Maria-Elena', 'Sarda-Mantel, Laure', 'Merlet, Pascale', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'West, Robert', 'Pla, Marika', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Krief, Patricia', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Omidvar, Nader', 'Padua, Rose Ann']","['Gorombei P', 'Guidez F', 'Ganesan S', 'Chiquet M', 'Pellagatti A', 'Goursaud L', 'Tekin N', 'Beurlet S', 'Patel S', 'Guerenne L', 'Le Pogam C', 'Setterblad N', 'de la Grange P', 'LeBoeuf C', 'Janin A', 'Noguera ME', 'Sarda-Mantel L', 'Merlet P', 'Boultwood J', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'West R', 'Pla M', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P', 'Krief P', 'Chomienne C', 'Omidvar N', 'Padua RA']","['INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Blood Cancer UK Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and BRC Haematology Theme, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1131, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis Hopital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Imagerie Departement, Universite de Paris, Institut de la Recherche Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'GenoSplice Technology, Paris Biotech Sante, 29 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S942, Universite de Paris, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S942, Universite de Paris, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Department of Cytology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Radiopharmacie AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Service Medicine Nuclear, AP-HP Lariboisiere, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Nuclear Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Blood Cancer UK Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and BRC Haematology Theme, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', 'M.

Despite recent advances in the treatment of this disease, the prognosis and overall long-term survival for patients remain poor, which drives the search for new chemotherapeutics and treatment strategies. Piceatannol, a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and wine, appears to be a promising chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia. The aim of the present study was to examine whether piceatannol induces autophagy and/or apoptosis in HL-60 human acute myeloid leukemia cells and whether HL-60 cells are able to acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity. We found that piceatannol at the IC90 concentration of 14 microM did not induce autophagy in HL-60 cells. However, it induced caspase-dependent apoptosis characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. Our findings also imply that HL-60 cells are able to acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity via mechanisms related to MRP1 activity. Our results suggest that the use of piceatannol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent may be associated with the risk of multidrug resistance, warranting its use in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.",,"['Siedlecka-Kroplewska, Kamila', 'Wronska, Agata', 'Kmiec, Zbigniew']","['Siedlecka-Kroplewska K', 'Wronska A', 'Kmiec Z']","['Department of Histology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210930,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BCRP', 'HL-60 cells', 'MRP1', 'P-glycoprotein', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'multidrug resistance', 'piceatannol']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/10/13 01:04'],"['2021/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms221910597 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms221910597 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 30;22(19). pii: ijms221910597. doi: 10.3390/ijms221910597.,22,19,,20211108,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC8509003,"['MN grant no. 01-0173/08/280/Medical University of Gdansk (Gdansk, Poland) and', 'Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6313-0799', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1792-8975', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9801-8166']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To dissect the role of fibroblasts in HTLV-1-mediated lymphomagenesis, transcriptome studies, cytofluorimetric and qRT-PCR analyses of surface and intracellular markers linked to plasticity and stemness in coculture, and in vivo experiments were performed. A transcriptomic comparison between a more lymphomagenic (C91/III) and the parental (C91/PL) cell line evidenced hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, confirmed by phospho-ELISA and 2-DE and WB analyses. C91/III cells also showed higher expression of mesenchymal and stemness genes. Short-term coculture with human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) induced these features in C91/PL cells, and significantly increased not only the cancer stem cells (CSCs)-supporting CD10(+)GPR77(+) HFF subpopulation, but also the percentage of ALDH1(bright) C91/PL cells. A non-cytotoxic acetylsalicylic acid treatment decreased HFF-induced ALDH1(bright) C91/PL cells, downregulated mesenchymal and stemness genes in cocultured cells, and delayed lymphoma growth in immunosuppressed mice, thus hindering the supportive activity of HFF on CSCs. These data suggest that crosstalk with HFF significantly intensifies the aggressiveness and plasticity of C91/PL cells, leading to the enrichment in lymphoma-initiating cells.

The Inhibition of Apoptosis (IAP) family member, survivin, also known by its gene and protein name, Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5 (BIRC5), remains one of the most frequently expressed antigens across AML subtypes. To better understand its potential to act as a target for immunotherapy and a biomarker for AML survival, we examined the protein and pathways that BIRC5 interacts with using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), search tool for recurring instances of neighbouring genes (STRING), WEB-based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit, Bloodspot and performed a comprehensive literature review. We then analysed data from gene expression studies. These included 312 AML samples in the Microarray Innovations In Leukemia (MILE) dataset. We found a trend between above median levels of BIRC5 being associated with improved overall survival (OS) but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.077, Log-Rank). There was some evidence of a beneficial effect in adjusted analyses where above median levels of BIRC5 were shown to be associated with improved OS (p = 0.001) including in Core Binding Factor (CBF) patients (p = 0.03). Above median levels of BIRC5 transcript were associated with improved relapse free survival (p < 0.0001). Utilisation of a second large cDNA microarray dataset including 306 AML cases, again showed no correlation between BIRC5 levels and OS, but high expression levels of BIRC5 correlated with worse survival in inv(16) patients (p = 0.077) which was highly significant when datasets A and B were combined (p = 0.001). In addition, decreased BIRC5 expression was associated with better clinical outcome (p = 0.004) in AML patients exhibiting CBF mainly due to patients with inv(16) (p = 0.007). This study has shown that BIRC5 expression plays a role in the survival of AML patients, this association is not apparent when we examine CBF patients as a cohort, but when those with inv(16) independently indicating that those patients with inv(16) would provide interesting candidates for immunotherapies that target BIRC5.",,"['Greiner, Jochen', 'Brown, Elliott', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Morris, Vanessa', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Guinn, Barbara-Ann']","['Greiner J', 'Brown E', 'Bullinger L', 'Hills RK', 'Morris V', 'Dohner H', 'Mills KI', 'Guinn BA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Diakonie Hospital Stuttgart, 70176 Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, Richard Doll Building, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', ""Patrick G.

However, their interaction with the immune system offers an intriguing challenge. Due to the unique physico-chemical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as nanocarriers of considerable interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy. CNTs, as a promising nanomaterial, are capable of both detecting as well as delivering drugs or small therapeutic molecules to tumour cells. In this study, we coupled a recombinant fragment of human surfactant protein D (rfhSP-D) with carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) CNTs (CMC-CNT, 10-20 nm diameter) for augmenting their apoptotic and immunotherapeutic properties using two leukemic cell lines. The cell viability of AML14.3D10 or K562 cancer cell lines was reduced when cultured with CMC-mwCNT-coupled-rfhSP-D (CNT + rfhSP-D) at 24 h. Increased levels of caspase 3, 7 and cleaved caspase 9 in CNT + rfhSP-D treated AML14.3D10 and K562 cells suggested an involvement of an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. CNT + rfhSP-D treated leukemic cells also showed higher mRNA expression of p53 and cell cycle inhibitors (p21 and p27). This suggested a likely reduction in cdc2-cyclin B1, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest and p53-dependent apoptosis in AML14.3D10 cells, while p53-independent mechanisms appeared to be in operation in K562 cells. We suggest that CNT + rfhSP-D has therapeutic potential in targeting leukemic cells, irrespective of their p53 status, and thus, it is worth setting up pre-clinical trials in animal models.",,"['Khan, Haseeb A', 'Kishore, Uday', 'Alsulami, Hamed M', 'Alrokayan, Salman H']","['Khan HA', 'Kishore U', 'Alsulami HM', 'Alrokayan SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biosciences, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210928,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cancer cells', 'carbon nanotubes', 'human SP-D', 'immunotherapy']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/10/13 01:03'],"['2021/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms221910445 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms221910445 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Sep 28;22(19). pii: ijms221910445. doi: 10.3390/ijms221910445.,22,19,,20211027,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Nanotubes, Carbon/*chemistry', '*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology']",PMC8508673,['15-NAN-3664-02/King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6084-8589', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6033-6759', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7511-8885']","['0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, CML treatment is based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT-allo) is currently the only effective treatment of CML. The difficulty of finding a compatible donor and high rates of morbidity and mortality limit transplantation treatment. Despite the safety and efficacy of TKIs, patients can develop resistance. Thus, microRNAs (miRNAs) play a prominent role as biomarkers and post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. The aim of this study was to analyze the miRNA profile in CML patients who achieved cytogenetic remission after treatment with both HSCT-allo and TKI. Expression analyses of the 758 miRNAs were performed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatics tools were used for data analysis. We detected miRNA profiles using their possible target genes and target pathways. MiR-125a-3p stood out among the downregulated miRNAs, showing an interaction network with 52 target genes. MiR-320b was the only upregulated miRNA, with an interaction network of 26 genes.

In recent years, the use of drug-conjugates, usually obtained by covalent coupling of a drug with biocompatible lipid moieties to form nanoparticles, has gained considerable attention. Natural products isolated from plants have been a successful source of potential drug leads with unique structural diversity. In the present work three molecules derived from natural products were employed as lead molecules for the synthesis of self-assembled nanoparticles. The first molecule is the cytotoxic royleanone 7alpha-acetoxy-6beta-hydroxyroyleanone (Roy, 1) that has been isolated from hairy coleus (Plectranthus hadiensis (Forssk.) Schweinf). ex Sprenger leaves in a large amount. This royleanone, its hemisynthetic derivative 7alpha-acetoxy-6beta-hydroxy-12-benzoyloxyroyleanone (12BzRoy, 2) and 6,7-dehydroroyleanone (DHR, 3), isolated from the essential oil of thicket coleus (P. madagascariensis (Pers.) Benth.) were employed in this study. The royleanones were conjugated with squalene (sq), oleic acid (OA), and/or 1-bromododecane (BD) self-assembly inducers. Roy-OA, DHR-sq, and 12BzRoy-sq conjugates were successfully synthesized and characterized. The cytotoxic effect of DHR-sq was previously assessed on three human cell lines: NCI-H460 (IC50 74.0 +/- 2.2 microM), NCI-H460/R (IC50 147.3 +/- 3.7 microM), and MRC-5 (IC50 127.3 +/- 7.3 microM), and in this work Roy-OA NPs was assayed against Vero-E6 cells at different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/mL). The cytotoxicity of DHR-sq NPs was lower when compared with DHR alone in these cell lines: NCI-H460 (IC50 10.3 +/- 0.5 microM), NCI-H460/R (IC50 10.6 +/- 0.4 microM), and MRC-5 (IC5016.9 +/- 0.5 microM). The same results were observed with Roy-OA NPs against Vero-E6 cells as was found to be less cytotoxic than Roy alone in all the concentrations tested. From the obtained DLS results, 12BzRoy-sq assemblies were not in the nano range, although Roy-OA NP assemblies show a promising size (509.33 nm), Pdl (0.249), zeta potential (-46.2 mV), and spherical morphology from SEM. In addition, these NPs had a low release of Roy at physiological pH 7.4 after 24 h. These results suggest the nano assemblies can act as prodrugs for the release of cytotoxic lead molecules.",,"['Ntungwe, Epole', 'Dominguez-Martin, Eva Maria', 'Bangay, Gabrielle', 'Garcia, Catarina', 'Guerreiro, Iris', 'Colombo, Eleonora', 'Saraiva, Lucilia', 'Diaz-Lanza, Ana Maria', 'Rosatella, Andreia', 'Alves, Marta M', 'Reis, Catarina Pinto', 'Passarella, Daniele', 'Rijo, Patricia']","['Ntungwe E', 'Dominguez-Martin EM', 'Bangay G', 'Garcia C', 'Guerreiro I', 'Colombo E', 'Saraiva L', 'Diaz-Lanza AM', 'Rosatella A', 'Alves MM', 'Reis CP', 'Passarella D', 'Rijo P']","[""CBIOS-Universidade Lusofona's Research Center for Biosciences & Health Technologies, Campo Grande 376, 1749-024 Lisbon, Portugal."", 'Pharmacology Area (Pharmacognosy Laboratory), New Antitumor Compounds: Toxic Action on Leukemia Cells Research Group, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Alcala de Henares, Ctra.

The transcription factor RBPJ forms a coactivator complex in the presence of a Notch signal, whereas it represses Notch target genes in the absence of a Notch stimulus. In the pancreas, a specific paralog of RBPJ, called RBPJL, is expressed and found as part of the heterotrimeric PTF1-complex. However, the function of RBPJL in Notch signaling remains elusive. Using molecular modeling, biochemical and functional assays, as well as single-molecule time-lapse imaging, we show that RBPJL and RBPJ, despite limited sequence homology, possess a high degree of structural similarity. RBPJL is specifically expressed in the exocrine pancreas, whereas it is mostly undetectable in pancreatic tumour cell lines. Importantly, RBPJL is not able to interact with Notch-1 to -4 and it does not support Notch-mediated transactivation. However, RBPJL can bind to canonical RBPJ DNA elements and shows migration dynamics comparable to that of RBPJ in the nuclei of living cells. Importantly, RBPJL is able to interact with SHARP/SPEN, the central corepressor of the Notch pathway. In line with this, RBPJL is able to fully reconstitute transcriptional repression at Notch target genes in cells lacking RBPJ. Together, RBPJL can act as an antagonist of RBPJ, which renders cells unresponsive to the activation of Notch.",,"['Pan, Leiling', 'Hoffmeister, Philipp', 'Turkiewicz, Aleksandra', 'Huynh, N N Duyen', 'Grosse-Berkenbusch, Andreas', 'Knippschild, Uwe', 'Gebhardt, J Christof M', 'Baumann, Bernd', 'Borggrefe, Tilman', 'Oswald, Franz']","['Pan L', 'Hoffmeister P', 'Turkiewicz A', 'Huynh NND', 'Grosse-Berkenbusch A', 'Knippschild U', 'Gebhardt JCM', 'Baumann B', 'Borggrefe T', 'Oswald F']","['Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Friedrichstrasse 24, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Surgery Center, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Friedrichstrasse 24, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211008,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Notch signaling', 'PDAC', 'Ptf1a', 'RBPJ', 'RBPJL', 'SHARP', 'transcriptional repression']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/10/14 06:01,['2021/10/13 01:02'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13195027 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13195027 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 8;13(19). pii: cancers13195027. doi: 10.3390/cancers13195027.,13,19,,,,PMC8508133,"['OS 287/4-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'SFB 1074/A03/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'BO 1639/9-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'GRK 2254/C4/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'GE 2631/3-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '#70114289/Deutsche Krebshilfe', 'ERC-StG 637987/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'SFB 1279 No. 316249678/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '109546710 - TRR81/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9140-346X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1900-600X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4325-5452', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2923-5765']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances in treating these diseases, patients with higher-risk MDS and AML continue to have a poor prognosis with limited survival. It has long been recognized that there is an immune component to the pathogenesis of MDS and AML, but until recently, immune therapies have played a limited role in treating these diseases. Immune suppressive therapy exhibits durable clinical responses in selected patients with MDS, but the question of which patients are most suitable for this treatment remains unclear. Over the past decade, there has been remarkable progress in identifying genomic features of MDS and AML, which has led to an improved discernment of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases. An improved understanding of immune and inflammatory molecular mechanisms of MDS and AML have also recently revealed novel therapeutic targets. Emerging treatments for MDS and AML include monoclonal antibodies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, vaccine therapies, and cellular therapeutics including chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and NK cells.

Although multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has proven of great utility in the diagnosis and classification of hematologic malignancies, its application to non-hematopoietic pediatric tumors remains limited. Here we designed and prospectively validated a new single eight-color antibody combination-solid tumor orientation tube, STOT-for diagnostic screening of pediatric cancer by MFC. A total of 476 samples (139 tumor mass, 138 bone marrow, 86 lymph node, 58 peripheral blood, and 55 other body fluid samples) from 296 patients with diagnostic suspicion of pediatric cancer were analyzed by MFC vs. conventional diagnostic procedures. STOT was designed after several design-test-evaluate-redesign cycles based on a large panel of monoclonal antibody combinations tested on 301 samples. In its final version, STOT consists of a single 8-color/12-marker antibody combination (CD99-CD8/numyogenin/CD4-EpCAM/CD56/GD2/smCD3-CD19/cyCD3-CD271/CD45). Prospective validation of STOT in 149 samples showed concordant results with the patient WHO/ICCC-3 diagnosis in 138/149 cases (92.6%). These included: 63/63 (100%) reactive/disease-free samples, 43/44 (98%) malignant and 4/4 (100%) benign non-hematopoietic tumors together with 28/38 (74%) leukemia/lymphoma cases; the only exception was Hodgkin lymphoma that required additional markers to be stained. In addition, STOT allowed accurate discrimination among the four most common subtypes of malignant CD45(-) CD56(++) non-hematopoietic solid tumors: 13/13 (GD2(++)&nbsp;numyogenin(-) CD271(-/+)&nbsp;nuMyoD1(-) CD99(-) EpCAM(-)) neuroblastoma samples, 5/5 (GD2(-)&nbsp;numyogenin(++) CD271(++)&nbsp;nuMyoD1(++) CD99(-/+) EpCAM(-)) rhabdomyosarcomas, 2/2 (GD2(-/+)&nbsp;numyogenin(-) CD271(+)&nbsp;nuMyoD1(-) CD99(+) EpCAM(-)) Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, and 7/7 (GD2(-)&nbsp;numyogenin(-) CD271(+)&nbsp;nuMyoD1(-) CD99(-) EpCAM(+)) Wilms tumors.

The concept highlights the complex interactions between the host and the other species, which, if disturbed may lead to disease and premature aging. Specifically, the impact of microbiome alterations on the etiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children is not fully understood, but has been the focus of much research in recent years. In ALL patients, significant reductions in microbiome diversity are already observable at disease onset. It remains unclear whether such alterations at diagnosis are etiologically linked with leukemogenesis or simply due to immunological alteration preceding ALL onset. Regardless, all chemotherapeutic treatment regimens severely affect the microbiome, accompanied by severe side effects, including mucositis, systemic inflammation, and infection. In particular, dominance of Enterococcaceae is predictive of infections during chemotherapy. Long-term dysbiosis, like depletion of Faecalibacterium, has been observed in ALL survivors. Modulation of the microbiome (e.g., by fecal microbiota transplant, probiotics, or prebiotics) is currently being researched for potential protective effects.

The present study aimed to characterise the phenotypic and functional properties of two subpopulations of typical CLL cells that differ in cell size: small (s-CLL) and large (l-CLL) CLL cells delineated by forward scatter cytometry. The s-CLL cells were characterised by the CD5(low)CXCR4(hi) phenotype, while the l-CLL cells were characterised by the CD5(hi)CXCR4(dim) phenotype and indicated a higher expression of CXCR3, CD20, CD38 and HLA-DR. The l-CLL cells displayed higher migration activity towards CXCL12, a tendency towards a higher proliferation rate and an increased capacity to produce IgM in the presence of CpG compared with s-CLL cells. When stimulated with CpG and CXCL12, l-CLL cells were characterised by a higher polarisation phenotype and motility than s-CLL cells.

Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs) are crucial for various actin cytoskeletal changes, which have established malignant consequences in various cancers, yet are still not being successfully utilized clinically towards cancer treatment. This work establishes the therapeutic activity of ROCK inhibitor (5Z)-2-5-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-3-ylmethylene)-1,3-thiazol-4(5H)-one (DJ4) in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of AML to highlight the potential of this class of inhibitors. Herein, DJ4 induced cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects in a dose-dependent manner in human AML cell lines (IC50: 0.05-1.68 muM) and primary patient cells (IC50: 0.264-13.43 muM); however, normal hematopoietic cells were largely spared. ROCK inhibition by DJ4 disrupts the phosphorylation of downstream targets, myosin light chain (MLC2) and myosin-binding subunit of MLC phosphatase (MYPT), yielding a potent yet selective treatment response at micromolar concentrations, from 0.02 to 1 muM. Murine models injected with luciferase-expressing leukemia cell lines subcutaneously or intravenously and treated with DJ4 exhibited an increase in overall survival and reduction in disease progression relative to the vehicle-treated control mice.

Herein, we investigated a proprietary cohort of MM and pPCL patients, focusing on the transcriptional signature of samples carrying t(11;14), whose incidence increases in pPCL in association with an unfavorable outcome. In addition, we evaluated the expression levels of the BCL2-gene family members and of a panel of B-cell genes recently reported to be associated with sensitivity to venetoclax in MM. Moreover, transcriptional analysis of lncRNAs in the two clinical settings led to the identification of several differentially expressed transcripts, among which the SNGH6 deregulated lncRNA might be relevant in the pathogenesis and prognosis of pPCL with t(11;14).

The resistance of MF clones against the suppressive action of ruxolitinib may be due to intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms leading to activity of additional pro-survival genes or signalling pathways that function independently of JAK2/STAT5. To identify alternative therapeutic targets, we applied a pooled-shRNA library targeting ~5000 genes to a JAK2(V617F)-positive cell line under a variety of conditions, including absence or presence of ruxolitinib and in the presence of a bone marrow microenvironment-like culture medium. We identified several proteasomal gene family members as essential to HEL cell survival. The importance of these genes was validated in MF cells using the proteasomal inhibitor carfilzomib, which also enhanced lethality in combination with ruxolitinib. We also showed that proteasome gene expression is reduced by ruxolitinib in MF CD34(+) cells and that additional targeting of proteasomal activity by carfilzomib enhances the inhibitory action of ruxolitinib in vitro. Hence, this study suggests a potential role for proteasome inhibitors in combination with ruxolitinib for management of MF patients.",,"['Claudiani, Simone', 'Mason, Clinton C', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Bianchi, Andrea', 'Pellegrini, Cristina', 'Di Marco, Antinisca', 'Fiol, Carme R', 'Robinson, Mark', 'Ponnusamy, Kanagaraju', 'Mokretar, Katya', 'Chowdhury, Avirup', 'Albert, Michael', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Naresh, Kikkeri', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S']","['Claudiani S', 'Mason CC', 'Milojkovic D', 'Bianchi A', 'Pellegrini C', 'Di Marco A', 'Fiol CR', 'Robinson M', 'Ponnusamy K', 'Mokretar K', 'Chowdhury A', 'Albert M', 'Reid AG', 'Deininger MW', 'Naresh K', 'Apperley JF', 'Khorashad JS']","['Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', ""Department of Information Engineering, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Science, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", ""Department of Information Engineering, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Liverpool University, Liverpool L7 8XP, UK.', 'Versiti Blood Research Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210928,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['carfilzomib', 'myelofibrosis', 'ruxolitinib', 'shRNA library screen']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/10/14 06:01,['2021/10/13 01:01'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13194863 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13194863 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 28;13(19). pii: cancers13194863. doi: 10.3390/cancers13194863.,13,19,,,,PMC8507927,['KKL1072/Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9566-4568', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6046-4355', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9817-0603']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was the first malignancy recognized to be associated with a genetic alteration, the t(9;22)(q34;q11). This translocation originates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, encoding the cytoplasmic chimeric BCR-ABL1 protein that displays an abnormally high tyrosine kinase activity. Although the vast majority of patients with CML respond to Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), resistance might occur either de novo or during treatment. In CML, the TKI resistance mechanisms are usually subdivided into BCR-ABL1-dependent and independent mechanisms. Furthermore, patients' compliance/adherence to therapy is critical to CML management. Techniques with enhanced sensitivity like NGS and dPCR, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, and the development of mathematical modeling and computational prediction methods could reveal the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance and facilitate the design of more effective treatment strategies for improving drug efficacy in CML patients. Here we review the molecular mechanisms and other factors involved in resistance to TKIs in CML and the new methodologies to access these mechanisms, and the therapeutic approaches to circumvent TKI resistance.",,"['Alves, Raquel', 'Goncalves, Ana Cristina', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'Almeida, Antonio M', 'De Las Rivas, Javier', 'Trougakos, Ioannis P', 'Sarmento Ribeiro, Ana Bela']","['Alves R', 'Goncalves AC', 'Rutella S', 'Almeida AM', 'De Las Rivas J', 'Trougakos IP', 'Sarmento Ribeiro AB']","['Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology, University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine (FMUC), University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology (CIBB), 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra (CACC), 3000-061 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology, University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine (FMUC), University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology (CIBB), 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra (CACC), 3000-061 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease (CHAUD), School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham NG11 8NS, UK.', 'Hospital da Luz Lisboa, 1500-650 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa, 2635-631 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Cancer Research Center (CiC-IBMCC, CSIC/USAL/IBSAL, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), University of Salamanca (USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL)), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Life Sciences, European University Cyprus, 2404 Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology, University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine (FMUC), University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology (CIBB), 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra (CACC), 3000-061 Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Hematology Service, Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra (CHUC), 3000-061 Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210926,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'TKI resistance', 'bioinformatics and artificial intelligence', 'epigenetics', 'immune system', 'new targeted therapies', 'patient adherence']",2021/10/14 06:00,2021/10/14 06:01,['2021/10/13 01:01'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/13 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13194820 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13194820 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 26;13(19). pii: cancers13194820. doi: 10.3390/cancers13194820.,13,19,,,,PMC8508378,"['UIDB/04539/2020/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'UIDP/04539/2020/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'PI18/00591/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2599-6433', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1470-4802', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1970-7375', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0984-9946', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6179-2772', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4142-4841']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the outcome of 967 pediatric AML patients with a known KMT2A-r status. The large cohort was characterized by morphology, multicolor flow cytometry, classical cytogenetics and mutation analysis via panel sequencing. In total, the blasts of 241 patients (24.9%) showed KMT2A-r. KMT2A-r is associated with FAB M5, a high white blood cell count and younger age at diagnosis. When subgroups were combined, KMT2A-r had no impact on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS); however, various subgroups showed a different prognosis, ranging from a <50% OS for KMT2A/AFDN (n = 11) to a 100% chance of survival for patients harboring the rare translocation KMT2A/SEPTIN9 (n = 3, follow up of 3.7 to 9.6 years). A positive correlation of KMT2A-r with KRAS mutations (p < 0.001) existed, albeit without any prognostic impact. In addition, FLT3-ITDs were detected less frequently in AML with KMT2A-r (p < 0.001). Furthermore, KMT2A-r were mutually exclusive, with mutations in NPM1 (p = 0.002), KIT (p = 0.036), WT1 (p < 0.001) and CEBPA (p = 0.006), and translocations NUP98/NSD1 (p = 0.009), RUNX1/RUNX1T1 (p = 0.003) and CBFB/MYH11 (p = 0.006). In the 346 patients tested for CSPG4 expression, a correlation between CSPG4 expression and KMT2A-r was confirmed.

Immunotherapy, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T), share the characteristic to exploit the capabilities of the immune system to kill cancerous cells. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against HER2 that prevents HER2-mediated signaling; it is administered mainly in HER2-positive cancers, such as breast, colorectal, biliary tract, and non-small-cell lung cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) inhibit the binding of CTLA-4 or PD-1 to PDL-1, allowing T cells to kill cancerous cells. ICI can be used in melanomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, urothelial, and head and neck cancer. There are two main types of T-cell transfer therapy: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (or TIL) therapy and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell therapy, mainly applied for B-cell lymphoma and leukemia and mantle-cell lymphoma. HER2-targeted therapies, mainly trastuzumab, are associated with left ventricular dysfunction, usually reversible and rarely life-threatening. PD/PDL-1 inhibitors can cause myocarditis, rare but potentially fulminant and associated with a high fatality rate.

The unique plasma cell biology maintained in multiple myeloma, coupled with its hematological nature and unique bone marrow microenvironment, provide an opportunity to design specifically targeted immunotherapies that selectively kill transformed cells with limited on-target off-tumor effects. Broadly defined, immune therapy is the utilization of the immune system and immune agents to treat a disease. In the context of multiple myeloma, immune therapy can be subdivided into four main categories: immune modulatory imide drugs, targeted antibodies, adoptive cell transfer therapies, and vaccines. In recent years, advances in all four of these categories have led to improved therapies with enhanced antitumor activity and specificity. In IMiDs, modified chemical structures have been developed that improve drug potency while reducing dose limiting side effects. Targeted antibody therapies have resulted from the development of new selectively expressed targets as well as the development of antibody drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies. Adoptive cell therapies, particularly CAR-T therapies, have been enhanced through improvements in the manufacturing process, as well as through the development of CAR constructs that enhance CAR-T activation and provide protection from a suppressive immune microenvironment.

Major challenges include immune escape and disease relapse demanding for further improvements in CAR design. To overcome such hurdles, we have invented the switchable, flexible and programmable adaptor Reverse (Rev) CAR platform. This consists of T-cells engineered with RevCARs that are primarily inactive as they express an extracellular short peptide epitope incapable of recognizing surface antigens. RevCAR T-cells can be redirected to tumor antigens and controlled by bispecific antibodies cross-linking RevCAR T- and tumor cells resulting in tumor lysis. Remarkably, the RevCAR platform enables combinatorial tumor targeting following Boolean logic gates. We herein show for the first time the applicability of the RevCAR platform to target myeloid malignancies like AML. Applying in vitro and in vivo models, we have proven that AML cell lines as well as patient-derived AML blasts were efficiently killed by redirected RevCAR T-cells targeting CD33 and CD123 in a flexible manner. Furthermore, by targeting both antigens, a Boolean AND gate logic targeting could be achieved using the RevCAR platform.

In the last years, circulating lncRNAs have been proposed as a new class of non-invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and to predict treatment response. The present study is aimed to investigate the potential of circulating lncRNAs as non-invasive prognostic biomarkers in myelofibrosis (MF), the most severe among Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. We detected increased levels of seven circulating lncRNAs in plasma samples of MF patients (n = 143), compared to healthy controls (n = 65). Among these, high levels of LINC01268, MALAT1 or GAS5 correlate with detrimental clinical variables, such as high count of leukocytes and CD34+ cells, severe grade of bone marrow fibrosis and presence of splenomegaly. Strikingly, high plasma levels of LINC01268 (p = 0.0018), GAS5 (p = 0.0008) or MALAT1 (p = 0.0348) are also associated with a poor overall-survival while high levels of LINC01268 correlate with a shorter leukemia-free-survival. Finally, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the plasma level of LINC01268 is an independent prognostic variable, suggesting that, if confirmed in future in an independent patients' cohort, it could be used for further studies to design an updated classification model for MF patients.",,"['Fantini, Sebastian', 'Rontauroli, Sebastiano', 'Sartini, Stefano', 'Mirabile, Margherita', 'Bianchi,

The deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11, del(11q), is a rare but recurrent clonal event in MDS. Here, we detail the largest series of 113 cases of MDS and myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) harboring a del(11q) analyzed at clinical, cytological, cytogenetic, and molecular levels. Female predominance, a survival prognosis similar to other MDS, a low monocyte count, and dysmegakaryopoiesis were the specific clinical and cytological features of del(11q) MDS. In most cases, del(11q) was isolated, primary and interstitial encompassing the 11q22-23 region containing ATM, KMT2A, and CBL genes. The common deleted region at 11q23.2 is centered on an intergenic region between CADM1 (also known as Tumor Suppressor in Lung Cancer 1) and NXPE2. CADM1 was expressed in all myeloid cells analyzed in contrast to NXPE2. At the functional level, the deletion of Cadm1 in murine Lineage-Sca1+Kit+ cells modifies the lymphoid-to-myeloid ratio in bone marrow, although not altering their multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution potential after syngenic transplantation. Together with the frequent simultaneous deletions of KMT2A, ATM, and CBL and mutations of ASXL1, SF3B1, and CBL, we show that CADM1 may be important in the physiopathology of the del(11q) MDS, extending its role as tumor-suppressor gene from solid tumors to hematopoietic malignancies.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

In this Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) analysis, we tested our hypothesis that the risk of NRM was higher with the development of cGVHD, particularly among older adults (age >/=60 years). We included 4429 adults age >/=40 years who underwent a first HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell alloHCT for acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2008 and 2017. We compared outcomes of 4 groups-older adults (>/=60 years) and younger adults (40 to 59 years) with cGVHD and older and younger adults without cGVHD-to determine the effect of older age and cGVHD on various outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazard models to determine the risk of NRM, relapse, and overall survival (OS). We treated cGVHD as a time-dependent covariate. The severity of cGVHD was based on the CIBMTR clinical definitions. cGVHD was significantly associated with a higher risk of NRM and lower risk of relapse regardless of age. The risk of NRM was higher for older adults versus younger adults. Adults who developed cGVHD as a group had longer OS compared with age-matched cohorts without cGVHD. Older adults had worse OS regardless of cGVHD. Among adults with cGVHD, clinically moderate or severe cGVHD was associated with a significantly higher risk of NRM and lower risk of relapse; severe cGVHD was associated with shorter OS, whereas mild to moderate cGVHD was associated with longer OS. Among both younger and older adults, the development of cGVHD was associated with a higher risk of NRM, lower risk of relapse, and longer OS. Older adults had a higher risk of NRM, but the increased risk of NRM associated with cGVHD did not differ based on age. The development of mild to moderate cGVHD offered the most favorable balance between minimizing NRM and decreasing the risk of relapse. The relapse risk was lowest for adults with severe cGVHD, but high NRM resulted in shorter OS. Developing strategies to avoid clinically severe cGVHD is critically important.

Cognitive interference processing and its correlated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in the brain have not yet been studied in this patient group. MATERIAL: Twenty-six adult childhood ALL survivors (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 40.0 [37.0-42.3] years) were investigated at median age (IQR), 35.0 (32.0-37.0) years after treatment with intrathecal and intravenous chemotherapy as well as cranial radiotherapy (24 Gy) and compared with 26 matched controls (median [IQR] age, 37.5 [33.0-41.5] years). METHODS: Cognitive interference processing was investigated in terms of behavioral performance (response times [ms] and accuracy performance [%]) and fMRI activity in the cingulo-fronto-parietal (CFP) attention network as well as other parts of the brain using the multisource interference task (MSIT). RESULTS: ALL survivors had longer response times and reduced accuracy performance during cognitive interference processing (median [IQR] interference effect, 371.9 [314.7-453.3] ms and 6.7 [4.2-14.7]%, respectively) comparedwith controls (303.7 [275.0-376.7] ms and 2.3 [1.6-4.3]%, respectively), but did not exhibit altered fMRI activity in the CFP attention network or elsewhere in the brain. CONCLUSION: Adult childhood ALL survivors demonstrated impaired behavioral performance but no altered fMRI activity when performing cognitive interference processing when compared with controls.

Indeed, although HMGA proteins lack transcriptional activity per se, they bind the minor groove of DNA at AT-rich sequences, and, interacting with the transcription machinery, are able to modify chromatin modeling, thus regulating the expression of several genes. HMGA proteins have been deeply involved in embryogenesis process, and a large volume of studies has pointed out their key role in human cancer. Here, we review the studies on the role of the HMGA proteins in human hematological malignancies: they are overexpressed in most of the cases and their expression correlates with a reduced survival. In some cases, such as in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, HMGA2 gene rearrangements have been also described. Finally, recent studies evidence a synergism between HMGA and EZH2 in diffuse B-cell lymphomas, suggesting an innovative therapy for this disease based on the inhibition of the function of both these proteins.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Haplo-identical SCT (haplo-SCT) may allow enhanced graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects by virtue of HLA class I/II donor-host disparities, but it typically requires intensive immunosuppression with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) to prevent lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we demonstrate in preclinical models that glucocorticoid administration from days -1 to +5 inhibits alloantigen presentation by professional recipient antigen presenting cells in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents donor T cell priming and subsequent expansion therein. In contrast, direct glucocorticoid signaling of donor T cells promotes chemokine and integrin signatures permissive of preferential circulation and migration into the BM, promoting donor T cell residency. This results in significant reductions in GVHD while promoting potent GVL effects; relapse in recipients receiving glucocorticoids, vehicle, or PT-Cy was 12%, 56%, and 100%, respectively. Intriguingly, patients with acute myeloid leukemia not in remission who received unmanipulated haplo-SCT and peritransplant glucocorticoids also had an unexpectedly low relapse rate at 1 year (32%; 95% CI, 18%-47%) with high overall survival at 3 years (58%; 95% CI, 38%-74%).

The exact mechanism of transport across the cell membrane and the disposition of active methotrexate metabolites-methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs)-are not well described in the literature. The aim of this study was to gain more insight into the plasma distribution of methotrexate and MTXPGs in pediatric patients with ALL and to clarify the obscure pathways of MTXPGs. METHODS: We prospectively measured the concentrations of MTXPG1-7 in plasma samples from three male pediatric patients treated with HD-MTX and leucovorin rescue according to the IC-BFM 2009 protocol using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Blood samples were obtained at 24, 36, 42, and 48 h after the start of HD-MTX treatment. RESULTS: Noticeable plasma concentrations of MTXPGs with a 2.2-fold interpatient variability were detected. The highest interindividual variability in total plasma MTXPG concentration was observed at 36 h, and ranged from 13.78 to 30.82 mumol/L. Among all patients, the predominant polyglutamate types in relation to the total plasma MTXPG concentration at each time point were MTXPG3 (16.71-30.02%) and MTXPG5 (26.23-38.60%), while MTXPG7 was the least abundant MTXPG (3.22-5.02%). CONCLUSION: The presence of MTXPGs in plasma of patients with ALL could be related to the action of ABC efflux transporters on blood cells and hepatocytes resulting from the administration of high doses of methotrexate. This study may not draw definitive conclusions, but it does reduce uncertainty about the dynamics of methotrexate and its active metabolites, which may be of vital importance for achieving a clinical response.","['(c) 2021.

It is unknown if there are survival differences between young and older patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: We studied the association of age with survival in 2326 mCRC patients enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial, a multi-center, randomized trial of first-line chemotherapy plus biologics. The primary and secondary outcomes of this study were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively, which were assessed by Kaplan Meier method and compared among younger versus older patients with the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on Cox proportional hazards modeling, adjusting for known prognostic variables. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Of 2326 eligible subjects, 514 (22.1%) were younger than age 50 years at study entry (yoCRC cohort). The median age of yoCRC patients was 44.3 vs. 62.5 years in patients age 50 and over. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between yoCRC vs. older-onset patients (median = 27.07 vs. 26.12 months; adjusted HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.88-1.10, P = .78). The median PFS was also similar in yoCRC vs. older patients (10.87 vs. 10.55 months) with an adjusted HR of 1.02 (95% CI = 0.92-1.13, P = .67). Patients younger than age 35 years had the shortest OS with median OS of 21.95 vs. 26.12 months in older-onset patients with an adjusted HR of 1.08 (95% CI = 0.81-1.44, Ptrend =0.93). CONCLUSION: In this large study of mCRC patients, there were no statistically significant differences in survival between patients with yoCRC and CRC patients age 50 and older.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Although arthralgia is common side effect associated with hypomethylating agents, arthritis has not been reported previously. CASE REPORT: We present the first recorded patient with arthritis after azacitidine treatment. The patient we presented here had severe cytopenias requiring transfusion with erythrocyte and platelet suspensions, and a complete hematological response was obtained for myelodysplastic syndrome after three cycles of azacitidine (AZA) treatment. However, interestingly, after each AZA treatment cycle, the patient had recurrent attacks of arthritis. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: The episodes of arthritis were possibly acute flares of pre-existing crystal-induced arthritis, as exhibited with azacitidine treatments and were managed effectively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. DISCUSSION: Because it is a rare condition, clinicians should not overlook AZA as a possible cause of arthritis exacerbations when arthritis of unknown etiology develops in patients treated with AZA.",,"['Iltar, Utku', 'Alhan, Fadime Nurcan', 'Vural, Ece', 'Atas, Unal', 'Sozel, Hasan', 'Dogan, Omer', 'Boduroglu, Ahmet', 'Yucel, Orhan Kemal', 'Salim, Ozan', 'Undar, Levent']","['Iltar U', 'Alhan FN', 'Vural E', 'Atas U', 'Sozel H', 'Dogan O', 'Boduroglu A', 'Yucel OK', 'Salim O', 'Undar L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, 37502Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211012,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['arthritis', 'azacitidine', 'crystal-induced arthritis', 'demethylating agent', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2021/10/13 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/12 12:21'],"['2021/10/12 12:21 [entrez]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211049728 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Oct 12:10781552211049728. doi: 10.1177/10781552211049728.,,,10781552211049728,,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7129-418X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9439-1588']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibiting the activity of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has become one of the effective methods for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Initially, imatinib was the first small molecule BCR-ABL Tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) for the effective treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Later, due to the emergence of various BCR-ABL mutations, especially T315I mutation, imatinib developed strong resistance. The second-generation kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib were able to overcome most of the mutation resistance but not T315I mutations. Therefore, in order to further overcome the problem of drug resistance, new types of KTIs such as flumatinib and radotinib have been developed, providing more options for clinical treatment, and some new drugs have entered clinical trials. In this review, two new BCR-ABL inhibitors (flumatinib, radotinib) and five new BCR-ABL inhibitors have been introduced into the clinical market in recent years, and we reviewed their research status, synthesis methods and clinical applications.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Xu, Xiao-Liang', 'Cao, Yu-Jing', 'Zhang, Wen', 'Rao, Guo-Wu']","['Xu XL', 'Cao YJ', 'Zhang W', 'Rao GW']","['College of Pharmaceutical Science, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Institute of Drug Development & Chemical Biology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014.

However, the cumulative doses of DOX above 550mg/m2 cause irreversible cardiotoxicity and other severe adverse effects. In this context, concerning DOX, several patents have been published in the last two decades. This activity highlights various aspects of DOX, such as registered patent analysis, pharmacological action, toxicityminimization, formulation development such as those approved by FDA, under clinical trials, and newly developed nano-delivery systems. AREAS COVERED: This review analyzes the different aspects of DOX-based chemotherapeutics and the development of drug delivery systems in theliterature published from 2000 to early 2020. EXPERT OPINION: DOX-based chemotherapy is still few steps away from being ""perfect and safe"" therapy. Certain severe systemic side effects are associated with DOX therapy. It is expected that, in the near future, DOX therapy can be much effective by selecting an ideal nanocarrier system, DOX conjugates, proper structural modifications, DOX-immunotherapy, and combination therapy.

NUDT15 variant genotype is reportedly highly associated with severe myelosuppression during maintenance therapy, particularly in Asian and Hispanic populations. It has also been demonstrated that acquired somatic mutations of the NT5C2 and PRPS1 genes, which are involved in thiopurine metabolism, are detectable in a portion of relapsed childhood ALL. To directly confirm the significance of the NUDT15 variant genotype and NT5C2 and PRPS1 mutations in thiopurine sensitivity of leukaemia cells in the intrinsic genes, we investigated 84 B-cell precursor-ALL (BCP-ALL) cell lines. Three and 14 cell lines had homozygous and heterozygous variant diplotypes of the NUDT15 gene, respectively, while 4 and 2 cell lines that were exclusively established from the samples at relapse had the NT5C2 and PRPS1 mutations, respectively. Both NUDT15 variant genotype and NT5C2 and PRPS1 mutations were significantly associated with DNA-incorporated thioguanine levels after exposure to thioguanine at therapeutic concentration. Considering the continuous exposure during the maintenance therapy, we evaluated in vitro mercaptopurine sensitivity after 7-day exposure. Mercaptopurine concentrations lethal to 50% of the leukaemia cells were comparable to therapeutic serum concentration of mercaptopurine. Both NUDT15 variant genotype and NT5C2 and PRPS1 mutations were significantly associated with mercaptopurine sensitivity in 83 BCP-ALL and 23 T-ALL cell lines. The present study provides direct evidence to support the general principle showing that both inherited genotype and somatically acquired mutation are crucially implicated in the drug sensitivity of leukaemia cells.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

A Campus CML report.,10.1111/bjh.17890 [doi],"Limited information is available on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The Campus CML network collected retrospective information on 8 665 CML patients followed at 46 centres throughout Italy during the pandemic between February 2020 and January 2021. Within this cohort, we recorded 217 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (2.5%). Most patients (57%) were diagnosed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second peak of the pandemic (September 2020 to January 2021). The majority (35%) was aged between 50 and 65 years with a male prevalence (73%). Fifty-six percent of patients presented concomitant comorbidities. The median time from CML diagnosis to SARS-CoV-2 infection was six years (three months to 18 years). Twenty-one patients (9.6%) required hospitalization without the need of respiratory assistance, 18 (8.2%) were hospitalized for respiratory assistance, 8 (3.6%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, while 170 (78%) were only quarantined. Twenty-three percent of patients discontinued tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy during the infection. Twelve patients died due to COVID-19 with a mortality rate of 5.5% in the positive cohort and of 0.13% in the whole cohort. We could also document sequelae caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and an impact of the pandemic on the overall management of CML patients.",['(c) 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Breccia, Massimo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Accurso, Vincenzo', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Barulli, Sara', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Crisa, Elena', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Stella De Candia, Maria', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'La Barba, Gaetano', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Leonetti Crescenzi, Sabrina', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Loglisci, Giuseppina', 'Lucchesi, Alessandro', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Luzi, Debora', 'Malato, Alessandra', 'Cristina Miggiano, Maria', 'Pizzuti, Michele', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Rapezzi, Davide', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Sancetta, Rosaria', 'Rita Scortechini, Anna', 'Sora, Federica', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Foa, Robin', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Breccia M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Accurso V', 'Attolico I', 'Barulli S', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Binotto G', 'Bocchia M', 'Bonifacio M', 'Caocci G', 'Capodanno I', 'Castagnetti F', 'Cavazzini F', 'Crisa E', 'Crugnola M', 'Stella De Candia M', 'Elena C', 'Fava C', 'Galimberti S', 'Gozzini A', 'Gugliotta G', 'Intermesoli T', 'Iurlo A', 'La Barba G', 'Latagliata R', 'Leonetti Crescenzi S', 'Levato L', 'Loglisci G', 'Lucchesi A', 'Luciano L', 'Lunghi F', 'Luzi D', 'Malato A', 'Cristina Miggiano M', 'Pizzuti M', 'Pregno P', 'Rapezzi D', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Rosti G', 'Russo S', 'Sancetta R', 'Rita Scortechini A', 'Sora F', 'Sportoletti P', 'Stagno F', 'Tafuri A', 'Tiribelli M', 'Foa R', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Roma, Italy.', 'Sant Eugenio Hospital, Hematology, Roma, Italy.', 'UO di Ematologia con Trapianto, AU Policlinico Paolo Giaccone, Palermo, Italy.', 'UO Ematologia con Trapianto, Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.', 'Divisione di Ematologia di Muraglia, CTMO Ospedale San Salvatore, Pesaro, Italy.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale Santa Corona, Pietra Ligure, Italy.', 'Ematologia ed Immunologia Clinica, Universita degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""U.O.C.

Using immunodeficient mice grafted with laboratory-generated human B-ALL, our previous study suggested that leukemia cells within the BM are resistant to graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects and that mobilization with CXCR4 antagonists may dislodge leukemia cells from the BM, enabling them to be destroyed by GVL effects. In this study, we extended this approach to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and murine T-ALL and AML models to determine its clinical relevance and effects on GVHD and donor hematopoietic engraftment. We found that posttransplant treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 significantly improved the eradication of leukemia cells in the BM in PDX mice grafted with B-ALL cells from multiple patients. AMD3100 also significantly improved GVL effects in murine T-ALL and AML models and promoted donor hematopoietic engraftment in mice following nonmyeloablative allo-HCT. Furthermore, posttransplant treatment with AMD3100 had no detectable deleterious effect related to acute or chronic GVHD. These findings provide important preclinical data supporting the initiation of clinical trials exploring combination therapy with CXCR4 antagonists and allo-HCT.","['(c) 2021.

In the Eurocord/ALWP EBMT and JSTCT/JDCHCT collaborative study, we evaluated the impact of GVHD on UCBT outcomes in Japanese and European registries. A total of 3,690 adult patients with acute leukemia who received their first single UCBT were included. A multivariate analysis of overall survival (OS) revealed a positive impact of grade II acute GVHD compared with grade 0-I GVHD, in the Japanese cohort (hazard ratio (HR), 0.81; P = 0.001), and an adverse impact in the European cohort (HR, 1.37; P = 0.007). A negative impact of grade III-IV acute GVHD on OS was observed regardless of registries. In the analysis of relapse, a positive impact of grade II acutes GVHD compared with grade 0-I GVHD was observed only in the Japanese cohort, regardless of disease risk. The positive impact of limited chronic GVHD on OS was observed only in the Japanese cohort. In conclusion, a positive impact of mild GVHD after a single UCBT was observed only in the Japanese cohort. This could explain the ethnic difference in UCBT outcomes and might contribute to the preference usage of UCBT in Japan.","['(c) 2021.

Haploinsufficiency of Fzr1 shows impaired quiescence and self-renewal ability of HSC in two Fzr1 heterozygous knockout mouse models. Mechanistically, FZR1 insufficiency inhibits the ubiquitination of RUNX1 protein at lysine 125, leading to the accumulation of RUNX1 protein, which disturbs the quiescence of HSCs in SAA patients. Moreover, downregulation of Runx1 reversed the loss of quiescence and impaired long-term self-renew ability in Fzr1(+/-) HSCs in vivo and impaired repopulation capacity in BM from SAA patients in vitro. Our findings, therefore, raise the possibility of a decisive role of the FZR1-RUNX1 pathway in the pathogenesis of SAA via deregulation of HSC quiescence.","['(c) 2021.

The presence of FLT3-ITD in AML carries a particularly poor prognosis and renders therapeutic resistance. New druggable targets are thus needed in this disease. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of de novo creatine biosynthesis upregulation by FLT3-ITD on AML sustainability. Our data show that FLT3-ITD constitutively activates the STAT5 signaling pathway, which upregulates the expression of glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), the first rate-limiting enzyme of de novo creatine biosynthesis. Pharmacologic FLT3-ITD inhibition reduces intracellular creatinine levels through transcriptional downregulation of genes in the de novo creatine biosynthesis pathway. The same reduction can be achieved by cyclocreatine or genetic GATM knockdown with shRNA and is reflected in significant decrease of cell proliferation and moderate increase of cell apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-mutant cell lines. Those effects are at least partially mediated through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. This study uncovers a previously uncharacterized role of creatine metabolic pathway in the maintenance of FLT3-ITD-mutant AML and suggests that targeting this pathway may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for FLT3-ITD-positive AML.

Multiple enzymes are involved as writers, erasers and readers of these modifications. Many RNA modifications or the respective enzymes are associated with human disease and especially cancer. Currently, the mechanisms how RNA modifications impact on a large number of intracellular processes are emerging and knowledge about the pathogenetic role of RNA modifications increases. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), the N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification has emerged as an important modulator of leukemogenesis. The writer proteins METTL3 and METTL14 are both involved in AML pathogenesis and might be suitable therapeutic targets. Recently, close links between 2'-O-methylation (2'-O-me) of ribosomal RNA and leukemogenesis were discovered. The AML1-ETO oncofusion protein which specifically occurs in a subset of AML was found to depend on induction of snoRNAs and 2'-O-me for leukemogenesis. Also, NPM1, an important tumor suppressor in AML, was associated with altered snoRNAs and 2'-O-me. These findings point toward novel pathogenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. The current knowledge and the implications are the topic of this review.","['(c) 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']","['Pauli, Cornelius', 'Kienhofer, Michael', 'Gollner, Stefanie', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Pauli C', 'Kienhofer M', 'Gollner S', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)-Heidelberg University Hospital, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20211011,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""*2'-O-methylation"", '*RNA modifications', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*epitranscriptome', '*m6A', '*snoRNAs']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/10/11 20:35'],"['2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/11 20:35 [entrez]']","['hsz-2021-0286 [pii]', '10.1515/hsz-2021-0286 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Chem. 2021 Oct 11;402(12):1531-1546. doi: 10.1515/hsz-2021-0286.

Their anticancer activity in vitro was screened towards MCF-7 (breast cancer), HCT116 (colon cancer), HepG2 (hepatoma), HeLa (cervical cancer), A549 (lung cancer), WM793 (melanoma) and THP-1 (leukemia) cell lines, and a highly active 5-fluoro-3-(4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-5-ylidenemethyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (3a) was identified and subjected to in-depth investigation of cytotoxicity mechanisms. This compound was found to possess the highest cytotoxic action towards tumor cells comparing with the action of other derivatives (1, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e). Compound 3a exhibited toxicity toward MCF-7, HCT116, and A549, HepG2 cancer cells, while the non-malignant cells (human keratinocytes of HaCaT line and murine embryonic fibroblasts of Balb/c 3T3 line) possessed moderate sensitivity to it. The compound 3a induced apoptosis in studied tumor cells via caspase 3-, PARP1-, and Bax-dependent mechanisms; however, it did not affect the G1/S transition in HepG2 cells. The compound 3a impaired nuclear DNA in HepG2, HCT116, and MCF-7 cells without intercalating this biomolecule, but much less DNA damage events were induced by 3a in normal Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts compared with HepG2 carcinoma cells.

It is aimed to contribute new cases to the literature by reviewing the cases in our archive and shed light into the understanding of the role of chromosome 7 in CML. This study was carried out in 237 newly diagnosed CML patients with variant Ph translocations. Among the patients, those with variant Ph translocation involving chromosome 7 were evaluated in terms of clinical and genetic characteristics. Chromosome analysis was performed on 24 and 48 h of bone marrow cultures. FISH analysis was performed with BCR-ABL1 dual color dual fusion translocation probes. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels were analysed by QRT-PCR and results were reported as BCR-ABL1/ABL1 (BCR-ABL1 (IS) %) according to international scale. Four of the patients had variant Ph translocations including chromosome 7. The karyotypes were 46,XX,t(7;9;22)(p13;q34;q11); 46,XX,t(7;9;22)(p21;q34;q11); 46,XX,t(7;9;22)(q22;q34;q11) and 46,XY,t(7;9;22)(q22;q34;q11). The breakpoints demonstrated by cytogenetic analysis were confirmed by FISH analysis. Monitoring by QRT-PCR showed that patients with variant Ph translocation including 7p13 and 7p21 had a dramatic decrease in BCR-ABL1 levels resulting in complete hematological, complete cytogenetic and deep molecular responses. Despite achieving complete hematological, complete cytogenetic response in two patients with variant Philadelphia translocation, including 7q22, no major molecular response was achieved and both patients are still in the warning category. Response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy may be associated with both the variant translocation mechanism and new gene interactions that occur due to the breakpoints of additional chromosomes involved in translocation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the high cost of targeted antibodies excludes a large cohort of patients from their benefits. In this context, copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were evaluated as alternative drug candidates against two common leukaemias, represented by HL-60 and K562 cells. A previous study identified JD88(21), JD47(29) and JD49(28) to be active against these cell lines with IC50 values between 1.9 and 6 muM and low leukocyte toxicity. To better understand their mechanism of action, their mode of cell death, effects on expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins and their respective genes were investigated. In both cell lines, the copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, at IC75 concentrations, caused membrane blebbing, raised phosphatidyl-serine levels on cell membranes and increased caspase-3 activity. A loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9, combined with poor caspase-8 activity indicated activation of intrinsic apoptosis. Apoptotic proteome analysis showed that the copper-imidazo[1,2-a] pyridines elevated protein levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and Smac/DIABLO in both cell lines, confirming their importance in apoptotic cell death. Conversely, though survivin was increased, this was counteracted by high levels of HTRA2/Omi expression. Effects on apoptotic regulatory proteins Bad, Bcl-2, XIAP and cIAP-1 was inconsistent between the copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and between the two cell lines, suggesting that the effect of the complexes was modulated by the molecular signature of each cell line. Analysis of mRNA transcripts showed a poor correlation between mRNA levels and associated proteins, implying that copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines compromised protein synthesis and degradation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed at clarifying the mechanisms towards the leukaemia-suppressive role of odoroside A (compound #1) and its derivative, oleandrigenin-3-O-beta-D-diginoside (compound #2) isolated from Nerium oleander. Viability and nuclear morphology change were assessed by CCK-8 assay and fluorescence microscope, respectively. Then, the cell apoptosis and autophagy induced by the compounds were detected by flow cytometry and Western blot. Xenograft model of nude mice was also applied to measure the leukaemia-suppressive effects of compound #2 in vivo. The result displayed that compound #1 and compound #2 inhibited the proliferation of HL60 and K562 cells and stronger effects were found in HL60 than K562 cells. Both of the compounds induced a dose-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in HL60 cells, where compound #2 was more potent than compound #1. Compound #2 also demonstrated a time-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in HL60 cells. Furthermore, ROS generation and JNK phosphorylation occurred in a dose-dependent manner in the cells treated with compound #2. Mitochondria also played critical role, proved by the decrease of Bcl-2, the release of cyto c to cytosol and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Moreover, the antitumour effects of compound #2 were validated in the nude mouse xenograft model in vivo. Odoroside A and its derivative inhibited the growth of leukaemia by inducing apoptosis and autophagy through the activation of ROS/JNK pathway. These results suggest that the compounds can serve as potential antitumour agents against leukaemia, especially acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).","['(c) 2021 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic', 'Pharmacological Society).

We unexpectedly find that PML promotes necroptosis in addition to apoptosis, with Pml(-/-) macrophages being more resistant to TNF-mediated necroptosis than wild-type counterparts and PML-deficient mice displaying resistance to TNF-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Reduced necroptosis in PML-deficient cells is associated with attenuated receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation, as revealed by reduced RIPK1[S166] phosphorylation, and attenuated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosome complex formation. We show that PML deficiency leads to enhanced TNF-induced MAPK-activated kinase 2 (MK2) activation and elevated RIPK1[S321] phosphorylation, which suppresses necrosome formation. MK2 inhibitor treatment or MK2 knockout abrogates resistance to cell death induction in PML-null cells and mice. PML binds MK2 and p38 MAPK, thereby inhibiting p38-MK2 interaction and MK2 activation. Moreover, PML participates in autocrine production of TNF induced by cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1)/cIAP2 degradation, since PML-knockout attenuates autocrine TNF. Thus, by targeting MK2 activation and autocrine TNF, PML promotes necroptosis and apoptosis, representing a novel tumor-suppressive activity for PML.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Extramedullary disease (EMD) relapse or relapse with CD19- disease has been observed after blinatumomab therapy in patients with r/r or MRD+ ALL. However, the pathophysiology and risk factors of treatment failure are not fully understood. METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of adult patients with B-cell ALL treated with blinatumomab (n = 132) for either r/r (n = 103) or MRD+ disease (n = 29) at the authors' center (2013-2021) and analyzed factors associated with treatment response and EMD failure. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 64%. A lower marrow blast burden before blinatumomab (P = .049) and no history of previous EMD (P = .019) were significantly associated with a higher response. Among the patients who responded to blinatumomab, 56% underwent consolidation with allogeneic transplantation. Blinatumomab failure was observed in 89 patients; 43% of these patients (n = 38) either progressed or relapsed at extramedullary sites. A history of extramedullary involvement (53% vs 24%; P = .005) and retention of CD19 expression at the time of relapse/progression (97% vs 74%; P = .012) were associated with a higher risk for extramedullary failure. Central nervous system (CNS) failure after blinatumomab was encountered in 39% of the patients with EMD. CONCLUSIONS: A history of EMD predicted an inferior response to blinatumomab therapy with a higher risk for relapse/progression at extramedullary sites (particularly CNS). Consolidation with allogenic transplantation in patients who primarily responded to blinatumomab did not abrogate the risk of extramedullary relapse. The incorporation of extramedullary assessment and the intensification of CNS prophylaxis may help in addressing extramedullary failure. LAY SUMMARY: Extramedullary failure is common during blinatumomab therapy for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A history of extramedullary disease predicts an inferior response to blinatumomab therapy and a higher risk for relapse/progression at extramedullary sites. Most extramedullary failure cases retain CD19 expression.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Otoukesh, Salman', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Mokhtari, Sally', 'Ngo, Dat', 'Mojtahedzadeh, Mona', 'Al Malki, Monzr M', 'Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Ali, Haris', 'Aribi, Ahmed', 'Sandhu, Karamjeet S', 'Arslan, Shukaib', 'Koller, Paul', 'Ball, Brian', 'Stewart, Forrest', 'Curtin, Peter', 'Artz, Andrew', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Otoukesh S', 'Zhang J', 'Mokhtari S', 'Ngo D', 'Mojtahedzadeh M', 'Al Malki MM', 'Salhotra A', 'Ali H', 'Aribi A', 'Sandhu KS', 'Arslan S', 'Koller P', 'Ball B', 'Stewart F', 'Curtin P', 'Artz A', 'Nakamura R', 'Marcucci G', 'Forman SJ', 'Stein AS', 'Pullarkat V']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Clinical and Translational Project Development, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Pharmacy, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Clinical Supportive Care, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211011,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'blinatumomab', 'extramedullary', 'refractory', 'relapse']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2021/10/11 12:35'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 12:35 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.33967 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Cancer. 2021 Oct 11. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33967.,,,,,,,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA033572/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9564-4498'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 are two essential proteins in the Bcl-2 family. In the present work, the differences in binding modes as between the two proteins and two ligands ABT-263/43b were investigated and compared. And the computational alanine scanning combined with the recently developed interaction entropy (AS-IE) method was employed for predicting their binding free energies and finding those amino acids that were more critical during the binding process. The result showed that the binding free energy calculated by the AS-IE method was more in line with experimental values than the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method. Besides, no significant difference was found between Bcl-xL and ABT-263/43b in the binding free energy, which Bcl-xL showed slightly weaker binding free energy to 43b because of the fewer number of key residues with interactions. Nonetheless, compared with the Bcl-2 and 43b complex, the Bcl-2 and ABT-263 system had greater number of key residues interacting with ABT-263, in particular, contribute favorably, resulting in a stronger binding ability for the Bcl-2 and ABT-263 systems. The van der Waals and hydrogen bond contributions were significant in the four protein-ligand complexes. Overall, Tyr108 was found to be the common key residues in the Bcl-xL-ligand complex, while Tyr105, Glu100, and Glu143 were established as the common key residue in the Bcl-2-ligand systems. We hope that the predicted hot spot residues and their energy distributions can guide the design of peptide and small-molecule drugs targeting Bcl-xL and Bcl-2.","['(c) 2021.

Due to the low frequency of Gamma-Delta (gammadelta) T cells in the peripheral blood, we developed an effective protocol to greatly expand a highly pure gammadelta T cells drug product for first-in-human use of allogeneic gammadelta T cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using healthy donor apheresis as an allogenic cell source, the lymphocytes are isolated using a validated device for a counterflow centrifugation method of separating cells by size and density. The lymphocyte-rich fraction is utilized, and the gammadelta T cells are preferentially activated with zoledronic acid (FDA-approved) and interleukin (IL)-2 for 7 days. Following the preferential expansion of gammadelta T cells, a clinical-grade magnetic cell-separation device and TCRalphabeta beads are used to deplete contaminating T-cell receptor (TCR)alphabeta T cells. The highly enriched gammadelta T cells then undergo a second expansion using engineered artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) derived from K562 cells-genetically engineered to express single-chain variable fragment (scFv) for CD3 and CD28, 41BBL (CD137L) and IL15-RA-together with zoledronic acid and IL-2.

Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of therapy discontinuation and interruptions, which have been correlated with shorter progression-free survival in chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL) patients. Recently, Xiao et al. identified that ibrutinib-mediated atrial fibrillation is likely due to off-target CSK inhibition. Given promising in vitro and in vivo evidence of maintained biological activity in CLL at lower-than-labeled ibrutinib doses, this elucidated mechanism substantiates the case to investigate alternative dosing schedules.

There are two major factors contributing to successful implantation: embryo quality and endometrial receptivity (ER). Although embryo quality might be assessed through morphological and genetic testing, no clinically approved techniques are available to evaluate ER. Mucus in different parts of the female reproductive tract contains many cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and nucleic acids, which influence and reflect various implantation-related processes. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to summarize available data regarding noninvasively obtained mucosal biomarkers for ER and to investigate their ability to predict the outcome of ART procedures. A broad literature search was performed to define studies related to noninvasive ER assessments. More than 50 biomarkers detectable in endometrial fluid, embryo transfer cannula leftover cells and mucus, menstrual blood, cervicovaginal washings are discussed herein. The remarkable methodological heterogeneity of the reviewed studies complicates the comparison of their results. Nevertheless, certain promising analytical targets may already be identified, such as urocortin, activin A, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IP-10, MCP-1, and several oxidative stress biomarkers. The present review contains a collection of currently available mucosal biomarker-related data, which may provide insights for future studies.Abbreviations: ART: assisted reproductive technology; ER: endometrial receptivity; IVF: in vitro fertilization; ICSI: intracytoplasmic sperm injection; IUI: intrauterine insemination; MeSH: Medical Subject Headings; hDP 200: human decidua-associated protein 200; ET: embryo transfer; IL-18: Interleukin-18; LRG: leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein; ROC: receiver operating characteristic; AUC: area under the ROC-curve; LH: luteinizing hormone; LIF: leukemia inhibitory factor; TNF-alpha: tumor necrosis factor alpha; IFN-gamma: interferon gamma; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; SOD: superoxide dismutase; CAT: catalase; LPO: lipid peroxidation; TTG: total thiol groups; TAP: total antioxidant power; CE: chronic endometritis.",,"['Jain, Mark', 'Samokhodskaya, Larisa', 'Mladova, Elena', 'Panina, Olga']","['Jain M', 'Samokhodskaya L', 'Mladova E', 'Panina O']","['Medical Research and Education Center, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Fundamental Medicine, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Medical Research and Education Center, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Fundamental Medicine, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Moscow, Russia.', 'Medical Research and Education Center, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Fundamental Medicine, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211010,England,Syst Biol Reprod Med,Systems biology in reproductive medicine,101464963,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarkers', 'assisted reproductive technologies', 'cervicovaginal washings', 'endometrial fluid', 'endometrial receptivity', 'menstrual blood']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2021/10/11 08:46'],"['2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/11 08:46 [entrez]']",['10.1080/19396368.2021.1985186 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Syst Biol Reprod Med. 2021 Oct 10:1-12. doi: 10.1080/19396368.2021.1985186.,,,1-12,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6594-8113', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6734-3989', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1397-6208']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about why some patients experience serious bleeding, including ICH, while others do not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults between 18 and 80 years old with acute leukemia and ICH between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2016 were included. Matched controls were identified using the propensity score matching method. Clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcome data were collected to identify variables associated with ICH. RESULTS: Of 2578 patients diagnosed with acute leukemia during the study period, 55 cases and 161 matched controls were included. Patients who experienced ICH were older (62 vs. 55 years, p = .004) and more likely to have diabetes mellitus (p = .04). Patients with ICH had a higher baseline white blood cell count (mean 84.5 +/- 115.8 vs. 28.7 +/- 58.5 x 10(9) /L, p = .001), peripheral blast count (61.3 +/- 96.5 vs. 21.2 +/- 50.8 x 10(9) /L, p = .004), and a longer PT (16.5 +/- 2.06 vs. 15.3 +/- 3.2 s, p = .002). Neither the platelet count at diagnosis, the platelet nadir, the number of days with a platelet count of less than 10 x 10(9) /L, or a diagnosis of platelet refractoriness were associated with ICH. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and more proliferative disease appear to be associated with ICH, whereas thrombocytopenia alone does not.

In the MIMOGA study, we found that a lower percentage of CD2(-) CD19(+) B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was a significant unfavourable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). Accordingly, we then analysed the immunoglobulin G (IgG) heavy-chain repertoire in PBMC by high-throughput sequencing. Of the 101 patients enrolled in the MIMOGA study, for 81 a sufficient amount of PBMC RNA was available for repertoire sequencing analysis. Peripheral IgG B cells in patients with ATL had a restricted repertoire relative to those in healthy individuals. There was a significant positive correlation between the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (SWDI) for the IgG repertoire and proportions of B cells in the PBMC of the patients. Multivariate analysis identified two variables significantly affecting OS: a higher serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor level, and a lower SWDI for the IgG repertoire [hazard ratio, 2.124; 95% confidence interval, 1.114-4.049; n = 44]. The present study documents the importance of humoral immune responses in patients receiving mogamulizumab-containing treatment. Further investigation of strategies to enhance humoral immune responses in patients with ATL is warranted.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Some patients with MDS have autoimmune diseases (AI). Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells help B cells produce antibodies. The role of Tfh in MDS with AI has not been studied. Methods: We enrolled 21 patients with MDS with AI and 21 patients with MDS without AI. The proportion of peripheral blood CD4(+)CXCR5(+) cells and the PD1 expression on CD4(+)CXCR5(+) cells were detected by flow cytometry. Serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 were measured. The survival and progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in MDS patients with or without AI were compared. Results: MDS with AI accounted for 19.6% of all MDS cases in our study. The overall response rate was 81% (17/21) in MDS patients with AI for the first-line treatment. The proportion of circulating CD4(+)CXCR5(+) cells was increased, but the expression of PD1 was decreased in MDS patients with AI. Serum IgG4 levels were also increased in MDS patients with AI. The proportion of peripheral blood CD4(+)CXCR5(+) cells and the level of serum IgG4 decreased after therapy, but the expression of PD1 increased. There were no differences in overall survival and progress to acute myeloid leukemia between MDS with AI and without AI groups.

BLV infection hinders the function of the immune system and induces other diseases, which negatively affects the performance and health of the infected cows. As the first line of defense against invading foreign pathogenic microorganisms, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) plays a vital role in the immune system of dairy cows. However, research on the effect of BLV infection on the immune function of PMN in dairy cows is scarce. Therefore, this experiment aimed to elucidate the effects and effect mechanisms of BLV infection on the immune function of PMN in dairy cows with different BLV provirus loads by detecting the chemotaxis, migration, adhesion, phagocytosis, respiratory burst function, and the formation of NETs. The experimental results showed that BLV infection had no significant effect on the phagocytosis of PMN but inhibited their migration and respiratory burst function, and the effects were closely related to the BLV provirus load. Under high BLV provirus load, PMN produced large amounts of NETs, chemokine CXCL7, adhesion molecule CD18, and pro-inflammatory factors IL-8 and TNF-alpha, triggering inflammatory responses, and tissue damage. The results of this study will help reveal the reason why BLV infection causes the high incidence of mammary gland inflammation in dairy cows.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lv, Wang, Wang, Lian and Wu.']","['Lv, Guanxin', 'Wang, Hai', 'Wang, Jianfa', 'Lian, Shuai', 'Wu, Rui']","['Lv G', 'Wang H', 'Wang J', 'Lian S', 'Wu R']","['College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, China.', 'Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Bovine Diseases, Daqing, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, China.', 'Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Bovine Diseases, Daqing, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, China.', 'Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Bovine Diseases, Daqing, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, China.', 'Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Bovine Diseases, Daqing, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, China.', 'Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Bovine Diseases, Daqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210923,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,['NOTNLM'],"['bactericidal function', 'bovine', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'immunosuppression', 'neutrophils']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:01,['2021/10/11 06:10'],"['2021/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2021.737608 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2021 Sep 23;8:737608. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2021.737608. eCollection 2021.,8,,737608,,,PMC8495415,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SERBP1 (SERPINE1 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is an RBP that comprises two RG/RGG repeat regions yet lacks other recognizable RNA-binding motifs. It is involved in mRNA maturation, and translational regulation. It was initially identified as a hyaluronic acid binding protein, but recent studies have identified central roles for SERBP1 in brain function and development, especially neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. SERBP1 regulates One-carbon metabolism and epigenetic modification of histones, and increased SERBP1 expression in cancers such as leukemia, ovarian, prostate, liver and glioblastoma is correlated with poor patient outcomes. Despite these important regulatory roles for SERBP1, little is known about its structural and dynamic properties, nor about the molecular mechanisms governing its interaction with mRNA. Here, we define SERBP1 as an intrinsically disordered protein, containing highly conserved elements that were shown to be functionally important. The RNA binding activity of SERBP1 was explored using solution NMR and other biophysical techniques. The outcome of these experiments revealed that SERBP1 preferentially samples compact conformations including a central, stable alpha-helix and show that SERBP1 recognizes G-rich RNA sequences at the C-terminus involving the RGG box and neighboring residues. Despite the role in RNA recognition, the RGG boxes do not seem to stabilize the central helix and the central helix does not participate in RNA binding. Further, SERBP1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, mediated by salt and RNA, and both RGG boxes are necessary for the efficient formation of condensed phases. Together, these results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SERBP1 functions in physiological and pathological processes.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Baudin, Moreno-Romero, Xu, Selig, Penalva and Libich.']","['Baudin, Antoine', 'Moreno-Romero, Alma K', 'Xu, Xiaoping', 'Selig, Emily E', 'Penalva, Luiz O F', 'Libich, David S']","['Baudin A', 'Moreno-Romero AK', 'Xu X', 'Selig EE', 'Penalva LOF', 'Libich DS']","[""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210924,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,['NOTNLM'],"['NMR', 'RNA binding protein', 'SERBP1', 'intrinsically disordered protein', 'mRNA binding']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:01,['2021/10/11 06:09'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fmolb.2021.744707 [doi]', '744707 [pii]']",epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Sep 24;8:744707. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.744707. eCollection 2021.,8,,744707,,,PMC8497785,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, little is known about the effect of birth weight on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and whether there is a dose-dependent relationship of birth weight with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and AML. To address these questions, the present work aimed to systematically investigate the relationship between birth weight and the risk of subsequent leukemia based on the current epidemiological studies Methods: Relevant studies were systematically retrieved from electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to May 15th, 2021. Finally, 28 studies (including 21 case-control studies and 7 cohort studies) were included for the final meta-analysis. Results in cohort studies were performed by risk ratios (RRs), while those in case-control studies by odds ratios (ORs), and all results were assessed by adopting the random-effect model. Besides, a dose-dependent analysis was conducted based on the cohort studies. Results: Compared with the population with normal birth weight (NBW), the population with high birth weight (HBW) might have an increased risk of leukemia (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.20-1.49; I (2) 0%). Meanwhile, low birth weight (LBW) was associated with a decreased risk of ALL, as evidenced from the pooled analysis of case-control studies (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92; I (2) 23.3%). However, relative to NBW population, the HBW population might have an increased risk of ALL (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.20-1.35; I (2) 7%). There was no obvious evidence supporting the relationship between LBW and the risk of AML from the pooled analysis of case-control studies (OR, 1.11 95% CI 0.87-1.42; I (2) 31.7%). Conclusions: Overall, in children and young adults, HBW population may be associated with the risks of subsequent leukemia and AML relative to NBW population, but the supporting dose-dependent evidence is lacking. In addition, compared with NBW population, there is stronger evidence supporting a significantly increased risk of subsequent ALL in HBW population, and a decreased risk in LBW population in a dose-dependent manner. More prospective studies with large samples are warranted in the future to validate and complement these findings.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Che, Long, Sun, Wang and Li.']","['Che, Hailuo', 'Long, Dunmei', 'Sun, Qian', 'Wang, Lina', 'Li, Yunbin']","['Che H', 'Long D', 'Sun Q', 'Wang L', 'Li Y']","['Department of Obstetrics, Zaozhuang Municipal Hospital, Zaozhuang, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maternal and Child Health Care of Zaozhuang, Zaozhuang, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Maternal and Child Health Care of Zaozhuang, Zaozhuang, China.', ""Department of Obstetricsl, Shanting District People's Hospital, Zaozhuang, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Zaozhuang Municipal Hospital, Zaozhuang, China.']",['eng'],['Systematic Review'],20210923,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'high birth weight', 'leukemia', 'low birth weight', 'meta-analysis']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:01,['2021/10/11 06:08'],"['2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.722471 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Sep 23;9:722471. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.722471. eCollection 2021.,9,,722471,,,PMC8495325,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the recent years, Mast cells have earned a greater importance for their presence and role in cancers. It is known that mast cells are attracted towards tumor microenvironment by secreted soluble chemotactic factors. Mast cells seem to exert a pro-tumorigenic role in hematological malignancies with a few exceptions where they showed anti-cancerous role. This dual role of mast cells in tumor growth and survival may be dependent on the intrinsic characteristics of the particular tumor, differences in tumor microenvironment according to tumor type, and the interactions and heterogeneity of mediators released by mast cells in the tumor microenvironment. In many studies, Mast cells and their mediators have been shown to affect tumor survival and growth, prognosis, inflammation, tumor vascularization and angiogenesis. Modulating mast cell accumulation, viability, activity and mediator release patterns may thus be important in controlling these malignancies. In this review, we emphasize on the role of mast cells in lymphoid malignancies and discuss strategies for targeting and steering mast cells or their mediators as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of these malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Mehtani and Puri.'],"['Mehtani, Deeksha', 'Puri, Niti']","['Mehtani D', 'Puri N']","['Cellular and Molecular Immunology Lab, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.', 'Cellular and Molecular Immunology Lab, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210924,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['blood cancer', 'cancer therapeutics', 'hematological malignancy', 'leukemia', 'lymphoid neoplasms', 'lymphoma', 'mast cells', 'myeloma']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:01,['2021/10/11 06:08'],"['2021/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.731323 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 24;11:731323. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.731323. eCollection 2021.,11,,731323,,,PMC8497976,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All that information has enabled the development of new therapeutic approaches that have improved life expectancy of the patients but are still not curative. We must increase our knowledge of the molecular alterations responsible for the characteristics common to all CLL patients. One of such characteristics is the poor correlation between mRNA and protein expression, that suggests a role of post-translational mechanisms in CLL physiopathology. Drugs targeting these processes have indeed demonstrated an effect either alone or in combination with other aimed at specific pathways. A recent article unveiled an increment in ubiquitin-like modifications in CLL, with many protein members of relevant pathways affected. Interestingly, the inhibition of the NEDD8-activating protein NAE reverted a substantial number of those modifications. The present review gets the scarce data published about the role of NEDDylation in CLL together and establishes connections to what is known from other neoplasias, thus providing a new perspective to the underlying mechanisms in CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Arenas, Castano, Dominguez-Garcia, Yanez and Pipaon.']","['Arenas, Victor', 'Castano, Jose Luis', 'Dominguez-Garcia, Juan Jose', 'Yanez, Lucrecia', 'Pipaon, Carlos']","['Arenas V', 'Castano JL', 'Dominguez-Garcia JJ', 'Yanez L', 'Pipaon C']","['Laboratorio de Hematologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla-Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla-Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla-Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla-Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla-Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210923,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLN4924-pevonedistat', 'NEDD8', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'post-translational modifications', 'ubiquitin']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:01,['2021/10/11 06:08'],"['2021/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.729550 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Sep 23;11:729550. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.729550. eCollection 2021.,11,,729550,,,PMC8495217,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most data available in the literature of such protocols is derived from well-controlled clinical trials. This report aims to provide a real-world experience from using a pediatric-inspired protocol in ALL-AYA population in larger number of patients treated at a national tertiary care referral center. Methods: Newly diagnosed Philadelphia negative ALL-AYA patients ages between 14 and 55 years of age were treated on an institutional protocol (AYA-15 protocol) adopted from a modified version of Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1900 protocol. At the time of this publication, a total of 79 patients were treated using the AYA-15 protocol between 2015 and 2020). Event-free survival (FFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 18 years (14-51 years) with 63% male patients. Complete remission (CR) at day 28 of induction was achieved in 88.6% of which 73.4% were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative. At a median follow up of 5 years, EFS, DFS and OS were 57.5%, 69.2% and 75.8% respectively. Toxicities were within the expected range with infections and transaminitis being the most common adverse events.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of circ-ATAD1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bone marrow mononuclear cells were collected from 60 patients with AML and 60 healthy controls, followed by RNA isolation and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR to assess the expression of circ-ATAD1 and microRNA (miR)-34b. A subcellular fractionation assay was used to determine the subcellular location of circ-ATAD1 in AML cells. Furthermore, circ-ATAD1 and miR-34b were overexpressed in AML cells to study crosstalk between the two molecules. The effect of circ-ATAD1 overexpression on miR-34b gene methylation was also analyzed by methylation-specific PCR, and the roles of circ-ATAD1 and miR-34b in the regulation of AML cell proliferation were analyzed by BrdU assay. circ-ATAD1 expression was found to be elevated, and inversely correlated with that of miR-34b, in patients with AML. Subcellular fractionation assays showed that circ-ATAD1 was specifically expressed in the nucleus. In addition, circ-ATAD1 overexpression in AML cells decreased miR-34b expression and increased miR-34b gene methylation. Moreover, AML cell proliferation was increased by circ-ATAD1 overexpression, but decreased by miR-34b overexpression, and the effect of circ-ATAD1 overexpression on AML cell proliferation was reduced by miR-34b overexpression. Together, these results indicate circ-ATAD1 as a nucleus-specific circRNA in AML, which promotes AML cell proliferation by downregulating miR-34b via methylation.",['Copyright: (c) Wu et al.'],"['Wu, Yarong', 'Gao, Bingjun', 'Qi, Xiaolei', 'Bai, Liyun', 'Li, Bixin', 'Bao, Hongjing', 'Wu, Xi', 'Wu, Xiaoyun', 'Zhao, Yuxia']","['Wu Y', 'Gao B', 'Qi X', 'Bai L', 'Li B', 'Bao H', 'Wu X', 'Wu X', 'Zhao Y']","[""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Danyang, Affiliated Danyang Hospital of Nantong University, Danyang, Jiangsu 212300, P.R.

However, the role of RBPs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear. Methods: We downloaded harmonized RNA-seq count data and clinical data for AML from UCSC Xena, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) cohorts. R package edgeR was used for differential expression analysis of 337 whole-blood data and 173 AML data. The prognostic value of these RBPs was systematically investigated by using univariate Cox regression analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis. C-index and calibration diagram were used to judge the accuracy of the model, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to judge the net benefit. The biological pathways involved were revealed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network performed lateral verification on the selected gene set and LASSO results. Results: A prognostic model of 12-RBP signature was established. In addition, the net benefit and prediction accuracy of the prognostic model and the mixed model based on it were significantly higher than that of cytogenetics. It is verified in the TARGET cohort and shows good prediction effect. Both the selection of our gene set and the LASSO results have high credibility. Most of these pathways are involved in the development of the disease, and they also accumulate in leukemia and RNA-related pathways. Conclusion: The prognosis model of the 12-RBP signature found in this study is an optimized biomarker that can effectively stratify the risk of AML patients.

To date, numerous studies have demonstrated that immune cells are one of the key targets for the treatment of RA. N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most common internal modification to eukaryotic mRNA, which is involved in the splicing, stability, export, and degradation of RNA metabolism. m(6)A methylated-related genes are divided into writers, erasers, and readers, and they are critical for the regulation of cell life. They play a significant role in various biological processes, such as virus replication and cell differentiation by controlling gene expression. Furthermore, a growing number of studies have indicated that m(6)A is associated with the occurrence of numerous diseases, such as lung cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we summarize the history of m6A research and recent progress on RA research concerning m(6)A enzymes. The relationship between m(6)A enzymes, immune cells, and RA suggests that m(6)A modification offers evidence for the pathogenesis of RA, which will help in the development of new therapies for RA.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wu, Li, Wu, Yin, Huang and Li.']","['Wu, Sha', 'Li, Xiao-Feng', 'Wu, Yuan-Yuan', 'Yin, Su-Qin', 'Huang, Cheng', 'Li, Jun']","['Wu S', 'Li XF', 'Wu YY', 'Yin SQ', 'Huang C', 'Li J']","['Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Postdoctoral Station of Clinical Medicine of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210924,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*N6-methyladenosine', '*autoimmune disease', '*cancers', '*immune cells', '*rheumatoid arthritis']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2021/10/11 05:55'],"['2021/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.731842 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Sep 24;12:731842. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.731842. eCollection 2021.,12,,731842,20211224,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Humans', 'Immune System/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Joints/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors/metabolism', 'RNA Stability']",PMC8498590,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has allowed the development of new therapeutic strategies against leukemia. Advances in biotechnology and the current understanding of T cell-engineering have led to new approaches in this fight, thus improving cell-mediated immune response against cancer. However, most of the investigations focus only on conventional cytotoxic cells, while ignoring the potential of unconventional T cells that until now have been little studied. gammadelta T cells are a unique lymphocyte subpopulation that has an extensive repertoire of tumor sensing and may have new immunotherapeutic applications in a wide range of tumors. The ability to respond regardless of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, the secretion of antitumor mediators and high functional plasticity are hallmarks of gammadelta T cells, and are ones that make them a promising alternative in the field of cell therapy. Despite this situation, in particular cases, the leukemic microenvironment can adopt strategies to circumvent the antitumor response of these lymphocytes, causing their exhaustion or polarization to a tumor-promoting phenotype. Intervening in this crosstalk can improve their capabilities and clinical applications and can make them key components in new therapeutic antileukemic approaches. In this review, we highlight several characteristics of gammadelta T cells and their interactions in leukemia. Furthermore, we explore strategies for maximizing their antitumor functions, aiming to illustrate the findings destined for a better mobilization of gammadelta T cells against the tumor. Finally, we outline our perspectives on their therapeutic applicability and indicate outstanding issues for future basic and clinical leukemia research, in the hope of contributing to the advancement of studies on gammadelta T cells in cancer immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Barros, de Araujo, Magalhaes-Gama, Pereira Ribeiro, Alves', 'Hanna, Tarrago, Malheiro and Costa.']","['Barros, Mateus de Souza', 'de Araujo, Nilberto Dias', 'Magalhaes-Gama, Fabio', 'Pereira Ribeiro, Thais Lohana', 'Alves Hanna, Fabiola Silva', 'Tarrago, Andrea Monteiro', 'Malheiro, Adriana', 'Costa, Allyson Guimaraes']","['Barros MS', 'de Araujo ND', 'Magalhaes-Gama F', 'Pereira Ribeiro TL', 'Alves Hanna FS', 'Tarrago AM', 'Malheiro A', 'Costa AG']","['Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Instituto Rene Rachou - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) Minas, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Aplicadas a Hematologia, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Aplicadas a Hematologia, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Diretoria de Ensino e Pesquisa, Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Aplicadas a Hematologia, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Medicina Tropical, UEA, Manaus, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Carlos Borborema, Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD), Manaus, Brazil.', 'Escola de Enfermagem de Manaus, UFAM, Manaus, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210922,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cell transplantation', '*clinical trials', '*gamma-delta T cells', '*leukemic microenvironment', '*off-the-shelf cell therapy']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/10/11 05:55'],"['2021/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.729085 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Sep 22;12:729085. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.729085. eCollection 2021.,12,,729085,20211227,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Intraepithelial Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8493128,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypertension represents an important cardiovascular complication and, if not appropriately managed, can contribute to developing thrombotic events. Third-generation TKI ponatinib is associated with hypertension development, and its use is more restricted than in the past. Few data are reported for second-generation TKI, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. The aim of this article was to evaluate with a systematic review and meta-analysis the real incidence of hypertension in CML patients treated with second- or third-generation TKI. Methods: The PubMed database, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched for studies published between January 1, 2000, and January 30, 2021; the following terms were entered in the database queries: Cardiovascular, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, CML, Tyrosine kinases inhibitor, TKI, and Hypertension. The study was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results: A pooled analysis of hypertension incidence was 10% for all new-generation TKI, with an even higher prevalence with ponatinib (17%). The comparison with the first-generation imatinib confirmed that nilotinib was associated with a significantly increased risk of hypertension (RR 2; 95% CI; 1.39-2.88, I(2)=0%, z=3.73, p=0.0002). The greatest risk was found with ponatinib (RR 9.21; 95% CI; 2.86-29.66, z=3.72, p=0.0002). Conclusion: Hypertension is a common cardiovascular complication in CML patients treated with second- or third-generation TKI.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Mulas, Caocci, Mola and La Nasa.']","['Mulas, Olga', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Mola, Brunella', 'La Nasa, Giorgio']","['Mulas O', 'Caocci G', 'Mola B', 'La Nasa G']","['Hematology Unit, Businco Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Businco Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Businco Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Businco Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210922,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['cardiovascular', 'chronic myeloid', 'hypertension', 'leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:01,['2021/10/11 05:54'],"['2021/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/11 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.674748 [doi]', '674748 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Sep 22;12:674748. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.674748. eCollection 2021.,12,,674748,,,PMC8493251,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate the role of selected polymorphisms in NUDT15, ITPA, and MRP4 genes in addition to TPMT in predicting 6-MP intolerance during ALL maintenance therapy. Patients and Methods: We screened for the presence of NUDT15*3 (c.415 C>T, rs116855232); MRP4 c.2269 C>T (rs3765534), ITPA c.94 C>A (rs1127354) polymorphisms in addition to TPMT *2 (rs1800462), *3A (*3B and *3C; rs1800460 and rs1142345) in ALL patients with documented severe neutropenia (cohort-1; n=42). These polymorphisms were then screened in a prospective cohort of ALL patients (cohort-2; n=133) and compared with 6-MP dose reduction, early/late myelotoxicity. Results: Nineteen (45%) patients in cohort-1 and 18 (14%) in cohort-2 had NUDT15 c.415 C>T variant while 4 (3%) patients in cohort-2 had TPMT*3C variant. Five (12%) in cohort-1 and 30 (24%) in cohort-2 had ITPA c.94 C>A variant while 9 (22%) and 15 (12%) had MRP4 c.2269 C>T variant in cohorts-1 and 2, respectively. All in cohort-1 and 36 (27%) in cohort-2 had severe myelotoxicity. Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) in cohort-1 and 40 (30%) patients in cohort-2 had significant 6-MP dose reduction. NUDT15 c.415 C>T variant explained severe myelotoxicity in 63% and 33% in cohort 1 and 2. TPMT*3C and ITPA c.94 C>A variants also explained myelotoxicity in cohort-2 (Median ANC: 376 vs 1014 mm(3); p=0.04 and 776 vs 1023 mm(3); p=0.04 respectively).

To date, a gold standard for the diagnosis and management of leukemic optic neuropathy has yet to be established. METHODS: Case series and review of the literature. Two illustrative cases were selected to discuss their treatment course and outcome. RESULTS: We report 7 cases of patients with leukemia or lymphoma presenting with optic nerve infiltration. All patients received steroid therapy for presumed infiltrative optic neuropathy, and 4 patients underwent radiation therapy. Along with systemic chemotherapy, all patients received intrathecal chemotherapy except one. Three patients received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic and lymphomatous optic neuropathy is difficult to diagnose and treat, and there is no gold standard for diagnosis or treatment in the current literature. We help clarify how this disease should be approached in a multidisciplinary fashion and on an individual basis to correctly diagnose and treat the vision loss, while considering the patient's long-term prognosis based on their systemic disease.",['Copyright (c) 2021 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.'],"['Lee, Victoria', 'Farooq, Asim V', 'Shah, Hassan A']","['Lee V', 'Farooq AV', 'Shah HA']","['Pritzker School of Medicine (VL), University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science (AVF, HAS), University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Neuroophthalmol,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,9431308,IM,,,2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2021/10/11 05:42'],"['2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/11 05:42 [entrez]']","['10.1097/WNO.0000000000001365 [doi]', '00041327-900000000-98624 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neuroophthalmol. 2021 Dec 1;41(4):e796-e802. doi: 10.1097/WNO.0000000000001365.,41,4,e796-e802,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL in real-world settings. PATIENTS/METHODS: A total of 200 relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a median age of 68 were included in this retrospective, multicenter, non-interventional study. Data of the study were captured from the patient charts of the participating centers. RESULTS: The median for lines of previous chemotherapy was 2 (1-6); 62 (31.8%) patients had del17p and/or p53 mutations (del17p(+)/p53mut). Of the study group, 146 (75%) patients achieved at least PR, while 16 (8.7%) patients discontinued ibrutinib due to TEA. The most common drug-related adverse events were neutropenia (n: 31; 17.4%) and thrombocytopenia (n: 40; 22.3%), which were >/= grade 3 in 9 (5%) and 5 (3.9%) patients, respectively. Pneumonia (n: 42; 23.7%) was the most common nonhematologic TEA. Atrial fibrillation (n: 5; 2.8%) and bleeding (n: 11; 6.3%) were relatively rare during the study period. Within a median follow-up period of 17 (1-74) months, 42 (21%) patients died. The estimated median OS of the study cohort was 52 months. Only the response to ibrutinib (CR/PR vs. SD/PD) was significantly associated with OS. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate good safety and efficacy for single-agent ibrutinib in R/R CLL in daily practice.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

For instance, an engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) can be introduced in T-cells or other immune cells and adoptively transferred to target and kill cancer cells in hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. The first CAR-T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has been developed against CD19, a B-cell marker expressed on lymphoma and lymphoblastic leukemia. To allow for personalized treatment, proteomics approaches could provide insights into biomarkers for CAR-T therapy efficacy and toxicity. AREAS COVERED: We researched the most recent technology methods of biomarker evaluation used in the laboratory and clinical setting. Publications of CAR-T biomarkers were then systematically reviewed to provide a narrative of the most validated biomarkers of CAR-T efficacy and toxicity. Examples of biomarkers include CAR-T functionality and phenotype as well as interleukin-6 and other cytokines. EXPERT COMMENTARY: Biomarkers of CAR-T efficacy and toxicity have been identified, but still need to be validated and standardized across institutions. Moreover, few are used in the clinical setting due to limitations in real-time technology. Expansion of biomarker research could provide better understanding of patient response and risk of life-threatening side effects with potential for improved precision medicine.",,"['DePriest, Brittany Paige', 'Vieira, Noah', 'Bidgoli, Alan', 'Paczesny, Sophie']","['DePriest BP', 'Vieira N', 'Bidgoli A', 'Paczesny S']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211017,England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Adaptive transfer', 'CAR-T cell therapy', 'T-cell therapy', 'biomarker', 'cancer', 'immunotherapy', 'multiplexed analysis', 'precision medicine']",2021/10/12 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2021/10/11 05:25'],"['2022/10/17 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/10/11 05:25 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14789450.2021.1992276 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2021 Sep;18(9):767-780. doi: 10.1080/14789450.2021.1992276.

Referral to palliative care services for these haematological patients remains limited or often confined to the last days of life. We pioneered a palliative care (PC) program integrated with standard haematological care. The purpose of this trial will study the interventions by the PC team and preliminary results in the clinical outcomes. METHODS: This project is a non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. In this study, we examine the clinical outcomes of the integrated PC program for MDS/AML patients when the 2nd lines disease treatment failed and in the presence of prognostic indicators. In group 1, patients will receive standard haematological care associated with PC (i.e., intervention group). In contrast, in group 2, patients will receive standard haematological care only (i.e., control group) with PC service only on a request basis. Patients who join the program would have to complete a standardized questionnaire to assess their quality of life and their psychological and physical symptoms. RESULTS: This is to exam the impact of the early integrated palliative care with enhanced psychosocial interventions to both advanced MDS/AML patients and their primary family members in Hong Kong. DISCUSSION: This protocol will not display any result. If future results demonstrate that the enhanced PC interventions are effective, they will provide a quality treatment plan for patients with MDS/AML.

Some of these patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT); yet, there are scarce data regarding transplantation outcomes. We conducted a multicenter nationwide retrospective cohort study, including patients with AML who underwent alloHCT in CR1 after frontline treatment with azacitidine plus venetoclax only (aza-ven group). We collected a historical control group of patients who achieved CR1 after first-line intensive chemotherapy only, followed by alloHCT (intensive group). Patients in the aza-ven group (n = 24) were transplanted between 2019 and 2021. Compared to the intensive group, patients in the aza-ven group were older (median age 71.7 vs. 58.4 years), had higher incidence of therapy-related AML and AML with antecedent hematologic disorder and had more often adverse cytogenetics. They had a higher percentage of allografts from matched-unrelated donors, and reduced intensity conditioning was more commonly used. The estimated 12 months non relapse mortality was 19.1% in the aza-ven group and 11.8% in the intensive group. The estimated 12 months relapse-free survival and overall survival were 58% and 63% in the aza-ven group and 54% and 70% in the intensive group, respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD at 6 months and of chronic GVHD at 12 months were 58% and 40% in the aza-ven group and 62% and 42% in the intensive group, respectively. Analysis of the aza-ven group revealed that HCT-CI score and ELN risk category were predictive of RFS in both univariate analysis as well as multivariate analysis. Our data suggests that alloHCT for AML patients achieving first CR with aza-ven appears feasible, with short-term post-transplant outcomes similar to those expected after traditional intensive chemotherapy.","['(c) 2021.

Time to first relapse was </=12 months in 49% and stage III/IV rrHL present in 52% of patients. In total, 291 patients received high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and intended ASCT failed in 38 patients. ASCT was primarily not intended in 80 patients largely due to low risk disease or age/comorbidities. Overall, 10-year progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates after first relapse were 48.2% (95% CI 41.9-54.2%) and 59.4% (95% CI 53.0-65.2%), respectively, with significant differences between subgroups. Inferior survival was observed with no ASCT due to advanced age/comorbidities (five-year PFS 36.2%, 95% CI 17.7-55.0%) or failure of salvage therapy (five-year PFS 36.3%, 95% CI 19.7-53.2%). Similarly, presence of primary refractory disease or stage IV at rrHL conferred inferior survival. In patients with low-risk disease, however, survival appeared favorable even without ASCT (10 y PFS 72.6%, 95% CI 53.7-84.8%). We herein confirm the curative potential of current rrHL treatments providing a robust benchmark to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies in rrHL.

METHODS: The clinical characteristics, diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy and outcome of JAK2 V617F and BCR-ABL double-mutant MPN were analyzed comprehensitively by combining a clinical case diagnosed and treated in our hospital with literature cases from CNKI and PubMed databases. RESULTS: A total of 38 related literatures were retrieved from the two databases by searching ""JAK2 V617F"" and ""BCR-ABL"" as key words from 1990 to 2019, and 59 cases were involved. Among all the 60 cases, 41 were males (68.3%) with a median age of 61 (32-77) years old, while 19 were females (31.7%) with a median age of 58 (21-82) years old.

METHODS: 96 children with T-ALL receiving CCLG-ALL2008 chemotherapy treated in our hospital from January 2015 to January 2020 were retrospectively summarized. The follow-up time was 9.0-65.0 months, with a median of 43.5 months. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to detect the overall event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients. The clinical data, MRD levels after 15 d, 33 d and 90 d chemotherapy between EFS group and relapse group, as well as OS group and death group were compared by using univariate analysis. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen the main risk factors affecting EFS and OS of the patients. The patients were divided into low, moderate and high-risk according to the MRD level after 15 d, 33 d and 90 d, the differences of EFS and OS between each groups were compared again. RESULTS: By the end of follow-up, 50 patients recurred and other 46 patients non-recurred; 40 patients died and 56 patients survived, the EFS was (49.5+/-6.3)% and OS was (61.5+/-5.9)%. Univariate analysis showed that the initial WBC count in EFS group (n=46) was significantly lower than that in relapse group (n=50), and MRD levels after 33 d and 90 d were significantly less also (P<0.05). Prednisone response in OS group (n=56) was better than that in death group (n=40), and central nerve invasion rate was lower, MRD level after 33 and 90 d were lower (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that MRD level after 90 d was the main risk factor affecting EFS of the patients; prednisone reaction, central nerve invasion and MRD level after 90 d were the main risk factors affecting OS of the patients (P<0.05). There were no differences of EFS or OS between the groups according to the MRD levels after 15 and 33 d (P>0.05), however for 90 d, EFS and OS of the patients in high-risk group were significantly lower than those in medium-risk group, and those in medium-risk group were lower than those in low-risk group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The MRD level after 90 days CCLG-ALL2008 chemotherapy may be the best time to predict the survival and prognosis in T-ALL children.",,"['Bao, Hong', 'Li, Tian-Yu', 'Wu, Yuan-Tao', 'Xiao, Zhuo-Tao', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Luo, Ling-Yun']","['Bao H', 'Li TY', 'Wu YT', 'Xiao ZT', 'Zhang L', 'Luo LY']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of wuxi, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu ProvinceChina."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of wuxi, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu ProvinceChina,E-mail: wxlty999@163.com."", 'Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215004 Jiangsu Province China.', 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006 Jiangsu Province China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of wuxi, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu ProvinceChina."", ""Suzhou Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of the University, Suzhou 215002 Jiangsu Province China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/10/11 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/10 20:37'],"['2021/10/10 20:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)05-1471-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct;29(5):1471-1477. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.015.,29,5,1471-1477,20211012,"['Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Serum protein expression profiles from 20 cases of normal healthy controls, and 20 cases of APL patients were detected by iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification)labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(2DLC-MS/MS), and analyzed by bioinformatics software. S100A8, LRG1 and SPARC were validated by ELISA. ROC was built by SPSS 20.0 software. RESULTS: Analysis identified 83 differentially expressed proteins in APL serum compared with control according to our defined criteria, of which 33 proteins were up-regulated and 50 proteins were down-regulated (P<0.05)IPA analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins were related to the function of Cellular Movement, Immune Cell Trafficking, Hematological System Development and Function, Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Tissue Development, and involved in a variety of signalling Pathways, the most representative pathways including LXR/RXR Activation and Acute Phase Response Signaling. S100A8 and LRG1 were found to be elevated and SPARC was markedly down-regulated in serum of childhood APL when compared to the normal controls as examined by ELISA (P<0.05), which was consistent with the iTRAQ result. The overall predictive accuracy of each protein was reflected by the area under the ROC curve(AUC), S100A8,LRG1 and SPARC with ROC areas of 0.841,1.000 and 0.944 respectively.

METHODS: The stable T-ALL cell line with knocked down beta-arrestin1 (Jurkat Sibeta1) was constructed. Flow cytometry and probe assays were used to detect ROS content in cell and mitochondrial, respectively. The relationship between beta-arrestin1 and microRNA was detected, analyzed and Q-PCR confirmed by microRNA microarray. The target genes of microRNA were predicated by miRbase software, identified by Western blot, and validated by Dual luciferase reporter gene. RESULTS: Jurkat Sibeta1 stable cell line was successfully constructed and it was found that ROS content was slightly reduced in Jurkat Sibeta1 at the whole cell level, and the ROS content was also significantly reduced in mitochondria. MicroRNA microarray analysis revealed that multiple T-ALL related microRNAs showed differentially expressed, in which the expression of miR-652-5p was significantly increased in Jurkat Sibeta1 (P<0.05 fold>2.0), and Q-PCR showed that miR-652-5p was nearly 5-fold up-regulated in Jurkat Sibeta1. miRbase predicted that the P62 gene was the target gene of miR-652-5p which could regulates mitochondrial function. P62 protein showed highly expressed in stably knocked down miR-652-5p in Jurkat cells. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirms that P62 was the target gene of miR-652-5p. CONCLUSION: beta-arrestin1 can decreases the expression of miR-652-5p and deregulates the translational inhibition of P62 mRNA, thus to increase ROS content in mitochondria of T-ALL cells.",,"['Wang, Hao-Biao', 'Liu, Shan', 'Guo, Wei', 'Liu, Hai-Yan', 'Yu, Jie', 'Zou, Lin']","['Wang HB', 'Liu S', 'Guo W', 'Liu HY', 'Yu J', 'Zou L']","[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine of Children's Hospital in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, ChinaNational Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaMinistry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaChongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine of Children's Hospital in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, ChinaNational Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaMinistry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaChongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine of Children's Hospital in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, ChinaNational Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaMinistry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaChongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaMinistry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaChongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, ChinaCenter for Clinical Hematology, Children's Hospital in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaMinistry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, ChinaChongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, ChinaCenter for Clinical Hematology, Children's Hospital in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine of Children's Hospital in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China,National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China,Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China,Clinical Research Unit of Children's Hospital in Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200062, ChinaE-mail: zoulin74@126.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/10/11 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/10 20:37'],"['2021/10/10 20:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)05-1456-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct;29(5):1456-1461. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.013.,29,5,1456-1461,20211012,"['Humans', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxygen', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Messenger', 'beta-Arrestin 1']",,,,,"['0 (ARRB1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN652 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta-Arrestin 1)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of adult AML patients with NUP98 gene rearrangement from January 2015 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed, including clinical characteristics, laboratory examination, genetic anomaly, treatment strategy and survival. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients with NUP98 gene rearrangement were detected in 410 adult AML patients (3.7%). The ratio of male to female among 15 patients was 1.1ratio1, and the median age was 43 (17-76) years old. The main FAB types were M2 and M4/M5, and including one unclassified. According to the genetic prognosis, 11 cases were intermediate risk, while 4 cases were high risk. The main type of NUP98 gene rearrangement was NUP98-HOXA9 (13/15, 86.7%). 10 patients underwent next generation sequencing, in which 5 patients showed epigenetic gene mutations, 3 patients showed FLT3-ITD or WT1 mutations, and 2 patients showed no mutation. After induction therapy, 13 of 15 patients achieved complete remissionCR. 7 of 8 patients with standard induction therapy achieved CR. 7 elder or intolerance patients with demethylation drug and chemotherapy all achieved CR. The median follow-up time was 28 months. The median OS of 15 the patients was 31.5 months (95% CI 10.7%-52.2%), and the median OS of the patients in non-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) group was 18.5 months (95% CI 17.8%-19.1%). The median OS was not reached for the patients in the Allo-HSCT group. CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT can significantly improve the prognosis of AML patients with NUP98 rearrangement.

However, its role in hematological diseases, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML), remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the expression pattern of ITGB2-AS1 in AML patients and to further explore its clinical significance. METHODS: ITGB2-AS1 expression was analyzed in public datasets (including TCGA and GSE63270) and further validated in a cohort of 109 AML patients by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: The level of ITGB2-AS1 was up-regulated among two independent cohorts (TCGA, P<0.05; GSE63270, P<0.05), which was confirmed by the data from 109 AML patients enrolled in this study (P<0.05). Clinically, high ITGB2-AS1 expression was associated with older age (P=0.023) and lower complete remission (CR) rate (P=0.005). Multivariate analysis identified that high ITGB2-AS1 expression was an independent prognostic factor not only for CR rate (P=0.027) but also for overall survival (OS) time (P=0.011), and ITGB2-AS1 was positively correlated with ITGB2 expression in both TCGA (r=0.74, P<0.001) and clinical data detected in this study (r=0.881, P<0.001). High ITGB2 expression was also associated with older age (P=0.02) and lower CR rate (P=0.020). Moreover, high ITGB2 expression predicted worse OS (P=0.028).

METHODS: KG1a cells with stable luciferase gene expression (called as KG1a-Luc cells) were constructed by lentivirus transfection, then sifted out by puromycin. Eighteen male NOD-SCID-IL2rg(-/-)mice aged 8 to 12 weeks were randomly and equally divided into two groups: the control group and the KG1a-Luc group. The mice in KG1a-Luc group were injected with 200 mul PBS containing 5x10(6) KG1a-Luc cells through tail veins, and the mice in control group were injected with 200 mul PBS only. The bioluminescence imaging technology was used to monitor the tumor burden in vivo. The peripheral blood of the mice in both groups was analyzed by flow cytometry. After the mice were sacrificed, there were pathologic evaluations: bone marrow and spleens made into smears, and livers sliced to get paraffin sections. The survival time of the mice in the two groups was recorded and compared. RESULTS: KG1a cells expressing luciferase stably were successfully obtained. The tumor luminescence wildly spread at day 17 captured by in vivo imaging. The KG1a-Luc tumor cells could be detected in the peripheral blood of the mice, with the average percentage of (16.27+/-6.66)%.

METHODS: The clinical data of 146 adult AML patients treated in Affiliated Hospital of Chifeng University from March 2015 to March 2018 were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Day 14 bone marrow biopsy (D14BM) cellularity and blast proportion, daily peripheral blood blast (PBB) clearance rate, time to PBB clearance and etc. were primarily observed after induction chemotherapy. All the patients were divided into Non-relapse survival group, Relapse survival group, Non-relapse death group and Relapse death group according to survival and recurrence situation during 2-year follow-up. The survival of the patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors were performed by ordinal Logistic regression, and ROC curve was used to assess the prediction efficiency of those factors for the 2-year overall survival (OS) and relapse of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were included since 8 cases failed to be assessed clinically. Their 2-year OS rate was 65.94%. Age of the patients in Non-relapse survival group was lower than that in Relapse death group. The D14BM cellularities in Non-relapse survival group and Relapse survival group were lower than those in Relapse death group (P<0.05). Daily PBB clearance rates in Non-relapse survival group and Relapse survival group were higher than those in Non-relapse death group and Relapse death group (P<0.05). There was a statistical difference among the four groups in the number of cycles of induction chemotherapy (P<0.05). The survival rate within 2 years in the patients with D14BM cellularity</=10% was higher than that in patients with cellularity >10%, while it was higher in patients with daily PBB clearance rate >20% than those with clearance rate</=20% (P<0.05). Age (HR=1.102, P=0.000), D14BM cellularity (HR=1.252, P=0.000) and the cycles of induction chemotherapy>/=3 (HR=1.703, P=0.000) were the risk factors affecting the prognosis of AML patients, while daily PBB clearance rate was a protective factor (HR=0.799, P=0.000). The AUC of age, daily PBB clearance rate and D14BM cellularity in predicting 2-year OS of AML patients was 0.738, 0.817 and 0.807, respectively, whereas in predicting relapse within 2 years it was 0.691, 0.647 and 0.711, respectively.

METHODS: si-PKM2 plasmid was transfected into HL-60 cells (set as si-PKM2 group), and blank vector transfected cells were set as control group (si-Ctl group). The expression levels of PKM2 mRNA and protein in si-Ctl group and si-PKM2 group were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. CCK-8 cell detection kit was used to detect the proliferation ability of the cells in the two groups. Flow cytometry was used to detect the changes of cell cycle and apoptosis. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the changes of p-Akt and p-mTOR protein levels in PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and the changes of glycolysis-related mRNA levels of the cells in the two groups. The changes in glucose consumption and lactic acid production of the cells were assayed. Over expressed PKM2, HL-60 cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or galactose, the changes in cell proliferation ability, cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as changes in glucose consumption and lactic acid production were detected. RESULTS: Interfered by si-PKM2, mRNA and protein levels of PKM2 in si-PKM2 group significantly decreased, and proliferation ability of the cells was also reduced (P<0.05). After PKM2 knockdown, the cells were significantly blocked at G1 phase, and cell apoptosis was obviously induced (P<0.05). p-Akt and p-mTOR levels were lower in si-PKM2 group than those in si-Ctl group. The glucose consumption and lactic acid production significantly decreased in si-PKM2 cells. Overexpressed PKM2, HL-60 cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The glucose consumption and lactate acid production induced by overexpressed PKM2 were reduced.

METHODS: CCK-8 method was used to detect the effect of ZL-n-91 to the proliferation of L1210 and K562 cells, and the proliferation rate, IC50 were calculated. The effects of ZL-n-91 to the cycle of L1210 and K562 cells was detected by PE single staining, and the effects of ZL-n-91 to the apoptosis of L1210 and K562 cells was detected by PE/7AA-D double staining. Western blot was used to detect the effect of ZL-n-91 to the expression levels of apoptosis related proteins. Subcutaneous tumor transplantation model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia L1210 was established in the nude mice, and the inhibitory effect of oral administration of ZL-n-91 to the xenograft was observed. RESULTS: ZL-n-91 showed a significant inhibitory effect to the proliferation of leukemia cells L1210 and K562 in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). After treated by ZL-n-91, the leukemia cells L1210 and K562 in the S-phase in cell cycle decreased significantly compared with those in control group (P<0.01). The apoptosis of leukemia cells L1210 and K562 could be induced by ZL-n-91 (P<0.001), and the expression level of apoptosis related protein BAX significantly increased. In the animal experiment, the result showed that ZL-n-91 could significantly inhibit the growth of subcutaneously transplantation tumor (P<0.05).

METHODS: ALL cell lines (including Reh, Jurkat and CCRF-CEM) were selected. The cell viability was detected by MTS assay and trypan blue staining was used to evaluate the death of the cell. The expression of autophagy related protein (including p62, LC3I/II) and Ferritin in ALL cells were detected by Western blot. The alteration of labile iron pool (LIP) in ALL cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Reh cells showed sensitivity to ferroptosis activator Erastin, while Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells showed resistant. Autophagy activator rapamycin could promote the sensitivity of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells to Erastin, and the ferroptosis of the cells (P<0.001). Autophagy inhibitor chloroquine could reduce the sensitivity of Reh cells to Erastin and resist the ferroptosis of the cells (P<0.001). The expression of Ferritin could be down-regulated after autophagy was activated in Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells (P<0.05), while the level of LIP was significantly increased (P<0.05). Inhibiting the autophgy in Reh cells could up-regulate the expression of Ferritin (P<0.01),while decrease the level of LIP (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The iron homeostasis in cells could be regulated by autophagy through affecting Ferritin expression and LIP level.

METHODS: Transcriptome data from 84 children with B-cell ALL at the time of diagnosis and prior to any treatment were used to analyze the differential gene expression. A prognostic scoring system based on the expression of the metabolism-related genes was constructed using Cox and Lasso regression methods. The prognostic value of the scoring system was further assessed by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out by using GSEA software. RESULTS: Among the 933 metabolism-related genes, 14 up-regulated genes and 17 down-regulated genes were identified as differentially expressed genes. In addition, 8 up-regulated genes (ASS1, CKM, PTGES, ADCY5, HNMT, PHGDH, CYP4F3, AADAT) and 4 down-regulated genes (GDA, DHRS9, IDO2, UGT2B4) were selected to establish a novel prognostic scoring system. Patients in the high-risk group showed poorer survival significantly than patients in the low-risk group (P<0.05). The prognostic scoring system was still shown to be an independent prognostic factor for the survival of children with ALL after the clinical characteristics, such as gender, age, white blood cell count at initial diagnosis, cytogenetics and molecular genetics were included (HR=8.906, 95%CI: 3.114-25.470). GSEA results showed that 6 metabolism-related pathways (amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism) were enriched in the high-risk group. CONCLUSION: The abnormal metabolism-related gene expression is associated with the clinical outcome of children with ALL, and these results provide potential novel prognostic biomarkers and treatment targets for pediatric ALL.",,"['Zhang, Hao', 'Chen, Juan', 'Ma, Hai-Zhen', 'Zhao, Long', 'Xi, Ya-Ming']","['Zhang H', 'Chen J', 'Ma HZ', 'Zhao L', 'Xi YM']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China E-mail: xiyaming02@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/10/11 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/10 20:37'],"['2021/10/10 20:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)05-1375-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct;29(5):1375-1379. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.002.,29,5,1375-1379,20211012,"['*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MLL-AF9 knock-in mice were bred and identified. When the mice developed leukemia, white blood cell (WBC) count in peripheral blood, flow cytometry and morphology method were analyzed to identify the disease. When the WBC count in peripheral blood was more than 100x10(9)/L, bone marrow cells and spleen cells were collected and cryopresevated. After resuscitation, the cells were injected into 4.5 Gy irradiated wild C57BL/6J mice through the tail vein to develop MLL-AF9 leukemia mouse model. Finally, the therapeutic effect was evaluated by positive drug on the model. RESULTS: The natural onset times of leukemia on MLL-AF9 knock-in mice were 22-28 weeks. The spleens of the transgenic mice enlarged and the bone marrow showed the immature forms of myeloid leukemia cells. Both the bone marrow and spleen cells highly expressed myeloid markers, CD11b and Gr-1. At least 0.5x10(6) bone marrow cells and 2.5x10(6) spleen cells could induce leukemia in all recipient mice, and the median survival times of mice were 20 days and 36 days, respectively. Experimental treatment was carried out on the leukemia mouse model transplanted with MLL-AF9 spleen cells, and it was found that the traditional chemotherapy drug cytarabine could delay the onset of leukemia and prolong the survival time of the mouse model. CONCLUSION: The leukemia model of hematopoietic cell transplantation based on MLL-AF9 transgenic mice is successfully established, which can be used for the study of the pathogenesis and evaluation of therapeutic effect of AML.",,"['Long, Wen-Yue', 'Shen, Xing', 'Xing, Shuang', 'Xiong, Guo-Lin', 'Wang, Hui-Guo', 'Yu, Zu-Yin']","['Long WY', 'Shen X', 'Xing S', 'Xiong GL', 'Wang HG', 'Yu ZY']","['Life Science and Technology College of Dalian University, Dalian 116622, Liaoning Province, China; Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Life Science and Technology College of Dalian University, Dalian 116622, Liaoning Province, China E-mail: wanghuiguo163@163.com.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Beijing 100850, China E-mail: yuzy79@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/10/11 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/10/10 20:37'],"['2021/10/10 20:37 [entrez]', '2021/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)05-1369-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct;29(5):1369-1374. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.001.,29,5,1369-1374,20211012,"['Animals', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion']",,,,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the loss of specific antigens, cell fratricide, T cell aplasia, and normal T cell separation are challenges in treating T cell leukemia/lymphoma with CAR T therapy. CD99 is a promising antigen to target T-ALL and AML as it is strongly expressed on the majority of T-ALL and AML. Here, we isolated a low-affinity CD99 (12E7) antibody, which specifically recognizes leukemia cells over normal blood cells. Moreover, T cells transduced with an anti-CD99-specific CAR that contained the 12E7 scFv expanded with minor fratricide and without normal blood cells toxicity. We observed that our anti-CD99 CAR T cells showed robust cytotoxicity specifically against CD99+ T-ALL cell lines and primary tumor cells in vitro and significantly prolonged cell line-derived xenografts (CDXs) or patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models survival in vivo.

However, the mutational spectrum and prognostic factors of ASXL1-mutated (ASXL1+) AML are largely unknown. We aim to evaluate the risk factors influencing the prognosis of ASXL1+ AML. METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 1047 cases of de novo AML and discovered 91 ASXL1+ AML (8.7%). The Log-Rank test and Kaplan-Meier were used to evaluate survival rate, and the Cox regression model was used to analyze multivariate analysis. RESULTS: In a total of 91 ASXL1+ AML, 86% had one or more co-mutations. The factors that had adverse impact on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) are defined as high risk factors, including age >/= 60 years, WBC count >/= 50 x 10(9)/L, FLT3-ITD mutations, RUNX1 mutations, and absence of AML1-ETO fusion gene. ASXL1 mutations without any risk factor were classified as single-hit ASXL1+ AML; ASXL1 mutations accompanied with one of the risk factors was referred to as double-hit ASXL1+ AML; ASXL1 mutations with two or more of the risk factors were designated as triple-hit ASXL1+ AML. The combination of these risk factors had a negative influence on the prognosis of ASXL1+ AML. The median OS was not attained in single-hit ASXL1+ AML, 29.53 months in double-hit ASXL1+ AML, and 6.67 months in triple-hit ASXL1+ AML (P = 0.003). The median EFS was not attained in single-hit ASXL1+ AML, 29.53 months in double-hit ASXL1+ AML, and 5.47 months in triple-hit ASXL1+ AML (P = 0.002). Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) improved the prognosis of double/triple-hit ASXL1+ AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided new insights into the mutational spectrum and prognostic factors of ASXL1+ AML patients.
