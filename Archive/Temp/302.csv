Restriction enzyme analysis of cellular oncogenes was performed on DNA of 25 patients. No rearrangements could be demonstrated within or near the genes c-myc, c-myb, c-abl, bcr, c-Ki-ras, and N-ras. No amplifications of these genes nor of N-myc or c-Ha-ras were present. Eight of 21 patients were heterozygote for ""rare"" Ha-ras allelic restriction fragments that have been associated with an increased risk of developing a malignancy. These patients were clinically indistinguishable from patients lacking these fragments. The breakpoint cluster region (bcr) that is rearranged in all patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia, was normal in all cases, including at least one patient with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. A 2.8 kb HindIII fragment of a hitherto unknown gene or pseudogene related to v-myb probably derives from the Y chromosome. Nineteen patients were examined for point mutations in the N-ras gene, using a novel synthetic oligonucleotide hybridization assay. In two patients activating point mutations were present, both in positions 1 of the 12th codon. Both patients were somewhat older than the others (16 and 11 years), had L2 morphology, and were shown to have high growth fractions of tumor in their bone marrow.","['Rodenhuis, S', 'Bos, J L', 'Slater, R M', 'Behrendt, H', ""van 't Veer, M"", 'Smets, L A']","['Rodenhuis S', 'Bos JL', 'Slater RM', 'Behrendt H', ""van 't Veer M"", 'Smets LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69941-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jun;67(6):1698-704.,,,,,,,,,,,

Log-phase CHO cells exhibited dose-dependent drug-induced DNA breaks, while plateau cells were found to be resistant to the effects of VP-16 and m-AMSA. Neither decreased viability nor altered drug uptake accounted for the drug resistance of these confluent cells. In contrast to CHO cells, plateau-phase HeLa and L1210 cells remained sensitive to VP-16 and m-AMSA. Recovery of drug sensitivity by plateau-phase CHO cells was found to reach a maximum approximately 18 h after these cells regained exponential growth and was independent of DNA synthesis. DNA strand break frequency correlated with cytotoxicity in CHO cells; log cells demonstrated an inverse log linear relationship between drug dose (or DNA damage) and colony survival, whereas plateau-derived colony survival was virtually unaffected by increasing drug dose.

In this study Percoll density gradient centrifugation and centrifugal elutriation were used to isolate large numbers of immature progenitor cells. Percoll density gradients were valuable as a first separation step: CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM could be enriched 75-fold in a light density fraction of d less than 1.056 g/ml and the technique could be adapted to cope with more than 10(10) buffy coat leucocytes. Progenitors cells were concentrated 3-fold by elutriation used as single method to separate buffy coat cells or when used to purify further light density Percoll fractions. When Percoll gradients and elutriation were used sequentially, undifferentiated mononuclear cells were enriched to more than 90% purity and between 5% and 40% of these cells formed CFU-GM or BFU-E colonies consisting of more than 40 cells. The enriched fractions were further characterized with monoclonal antibodies. The density and elutriation profiles of these colony forming cells resembled corresponding profiles of cells that reacted with the monoclonal antibody BI-3C5, which recognizes an antigen on primitive haemopoietic progenitor cells.

Acutely and persistently infected cells become resistant to virus-induced lysis.,117-32,"Friend leukemia cells (FLC) are susceptible to infection by Sendai virus, a member of the paramyxovirus group. FLC constitute a most suitable model to study virus-host cell interactions, because they grow in suspension (thus avoiding the use of trypsin), and provide an easy way of deriving single-cell clones. When FLC are infected with Sendai virus at high m.o.i., a direct, extensive lysis of the cells ensues, whereas lower doses of virus result in a cytocidal infection whose lethality depends mainly on the virus used, standard or defective interfering egg-grown Sendai virus (EGSV), and on the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i). At later times after infection, FLC become resistant to the Sendai induced lysis (SIL). The SIL resistance can be maintained in single-cell clones that had survived the first infection. The maintenance of the resistant phenotype of the clones requires the serial subcultivation of the cells in the presence of activated EGSV. The mechanisms that presumably regulate the appearance of SIL resistance in Sendai infected FLC are discussed.","['Benedetto, A', 'Amici, C', 'Zaniratti, S', 'Elia, G', 'Camporiondo, M P']","['Benedetto A', 'Amici C', 'Zaniratti S', 'Elia G', 'Camporiondo MP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', '*Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Defective Viruses/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hemagglutination Tests', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Temperature', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Virus Replication']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-1702(86)90036-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(86)90036-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1986 Feb;4(2):117-32. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(86)90036-5.,,,,,,,,,,,

Activities of all five glycosidases in leukocytes of patients with AML were within the normal limits. Glycosidase activities were also examined in leukocytes of three groups of patients with CML at different stages of the disease: chronic, progressive and blast crisis. All the enrymes exhibited the highest activity in the first group of patients; the activities of these enxymes in the second group were lower and those in the third group were close to normal. When CML leukocytes were fractionated using the Ficoll-verografin method, the activities of the enzymes in the interface fraction (unmatured cells) were higher than those in the bottom fraction (matured granulyocytes).

As indicated by the results of the trial, the antibodies to the enzootic bovine leucosis virus (BLV) were produced soon after experimental infection. A high sensitivity of the serum-neutralization test and the ELISA method was demonstrated in this connection: by these methods, the antibodies were identified already two to three weeks after experimental infection whereas by the immunodiffusion test they could be detected only after five weeks. Twenty-four animals were exposed to natural contact infection. Within 270 days of the trial, the disease after contact was recorded only in one heifer out of the four that were in close contact with the experimentally infected animals. In this case, as compared with experimental infection, the antibodies were produced much later--after 85 to 93 days. Leucosis was recorded in none of the remaining animals. The reasons why such a favourable result was obtained were the thorough disinfection of the stables after blood collections and the strict observance of the aseptic conditions. The results of experimental infection in three cows were identical with those obtained in young cattle. In the experimentally infected dairy cows, antibodies in milk were determined by the ELISA method. As found, in milk the antibodies to BLV appear two to three weeks later than they do in serum. The ELISA method of BLV antibody detection can be used for the identification of infected animals in herds where enzootic bovine leucosis occurs.","['Hofirek, B', 'Horin, P', 'Granatova, M', 'Machatkova, M', 'Franz, J', 'Svoboda, I', 'Blecha, J']","['Hofirek B', 'Horin P', 'Granatova M', 'Machatkova M', 'Franz J', 'Svoboda I', 'Blecha J']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vet Med (Praha),Veterinarni medicina,0063417,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Leukemia/immunology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Neutralization Tests']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vet Med (Praha). 1986 Mar;31(3):129-40.,,,Experimentalni a prirozena infekce virem enzooticke leukozy skotu (BLV).,,,,,,,,

We report now that resting Sezary cells (SC) were essentially negative for activation antigens (Ag) detected by monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) B1.49.9, anti-Tac, OKT9, OKT10, and OKIa1. After phytohaemagglutin (PHA) stimulation, all these Ag were expressed with the notable exception of OKT10. Further investigations of SC functions indicated that no interleukin 2 (IL-2) biological activity was detected in culture supernatants of SC constimulated with PHA and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Interestingly, such stimulated SC exhibited a marked capacity to absorb exogenous IL-2 while remaining unable to proliferate. These data suggest that patient's unresponsiveness to PHA may be unrelated to IL-2 as an extracellular growth signal, but may instead be due to a failure in a later cellular activation event, subsequent to the binding of IL-2 to its receptors. Lack of T10 Ag expression may be involved as a cause or a consequence. Kinetic study of suppression of PHA-induced T-cell proliferation of normal PBMC revealed that inhibition occurred during the first 24 h; moreover we showed that it was not due to limitation of available IL-2 since it persisted in excess of IL-2; remarkably the growth of an IL-2-dependent murine cell line was unaffected by the presence of SC. Further, inhibition was also observed on IL-2-independent calcium ionophore A 23187-induced T-cell proliferation of normal PBMC. Taken together, the data suggest that the target of suppressor activity is probably an important obligatory intracellular event controlling DNA replication, which is common to both IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent T-cell activation processes. Human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus I (HTLV-I) related p.19 and p.24 Ag were absent on fresh and 30-day cultured SC, suggesting the absence of HTLV-I infection, although not ruling out a proviral integration in the SC DNA.","['Golstein, M M', 'Farnarier-Seidel, C', 'Daubney, P', 'Kaplanski, S']","['Golstein MM', 'Farnarier-Seidel C', 'Daubney P', 'Kaplanski S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Interphase', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis', 'Sezary Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb01942.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1986 Jan;23(1):53-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb01942.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to mutations in the U3 region of its long terminal repeat, MPSV has an expanded host range that includes cells of the hematopoietic compartment. Using a MPSV recombinant containing the gene for neomycin-resistance (NeoR-MPSV), we demonstrate that the host range of MPSV also includes undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. Transfer of G418-resistance with NeoR-MPSV to F9 cells is almost as efficient as G418-resistance transfer to fibroblasts, in contrast to G418-resistance transfer to PCC4 embryonal carcinoma cells, which is at least 3 orders of magnitude lower. To isolate NeoR-MPSV mutants that are efficiently expressed in PCC4 cells, G418-resistant PCC4 cell lines were induced to differentiate, and the provirus was rescued by superinfection with murine leukemia virus. Viral isolates (PCMV-5 and -6; PCMV = PCC4 cell-passaged NeoR-MPSV) were obtained and assayed for expression in embryonal carcinoma cells. The efficiency of NeoR transfer was equally as high in both F9 and PCC4 as in fibroblasts. mos oncogene expression was unaltered as judged by transformation capability. No gross alteration in the coding region and in the long terminal repeat was detectable by restriction enzyme analysis. NeoR-MPSV and its mutants PCMV-5 and -6 can thus be utilized as vectors for the efficient transduction of genes into embryonic cells.","['Franz, T', 'Hilberg, F', 'Seliger, B', 'Stocking, C', 'Ostertag, W']","['Franz T', 'Hilberg F', 'Seliger B', 'Stocking C', 'Ostertag W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Teratoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.10.3292 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 May;83(10):3292-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.10.3292.,,,,PMC323499,,,,,,,

The right hand end contains adjacent elements with close sequence similarity to portions of the human and hamster type I and type II Alu consensus sequences.

These variants were selected after mutagenesis by growing the cells in dimethyl sulphate and 3-aminobenzamide. The characterisation of one of these variants is described. Variant 3 cells repair low doses of DNA damage in the presence of ADP-ribosyl transferase inhibitors. The Vmax of the ADP-ribosyl transferase enzyme in these cells is only increased 35% compared to normal wild-type L1210 cells. The basal DNA ligase I activity is increased 66% above wild-type whereas DNA ligase II activity appears to be unchanged. The most striking observation, however, is that the DNA ligase II activity is not increased after dimethyl sulphate treatment as occurs in wild-type L1210 cells. It seems that by increasing DNA ligase I levels these cells can survive DNA damage in the presence of 3-aminobenzamide. This variant (mutant) provides genetic evidence for our previously published hypothesis that (ADP-ribose)n biosynthesis is required for efficient DNA repair after DNA damage by monofunctional alkylating agents, because ADP-ribosyl transferase activity regulates DNA ligase activity. This variant is the first mammalian cell reported in which DNA ligase activity is altered, as far as we are aware. In yeast, a DNA ligase mutant has a cell division cycle (cdc) phenotype. Presumably, DNA ligase is essential for DNA synthesis, repair and recombination. The present variant provides further evidence that in mammalian cells, DNA ligase II activity is related to ADP-ribosyl transferase activity.","['Murray, B', 'Irwin, J', 'Creissen, D', 'Tavassoli, M', 'Durkacz, B W', 'Shall, S']","['Murray B', 'Irwin J', 'Creissen D', 'Tavassoli M', 'Durkacz BW', 'Shall S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '0 (Sulfuric Acids)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'DNA Ligases/metabolism', '*DNA Repair', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/*toxicity', 'Sulfuric Acids/*toxicity']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-8817(86)90054-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-8817(86)90054-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1986 May;165(3):191-8. doi: 10.1016/0167-8817(86)90054-4.,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in comparison to strain LY-R, strain LY-S has been found to be more sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation, more resistant to the lethal effects of UV radiation, but less mutable at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus by both UV and X-radiation. In the present work, the lethal and mutagenic effects of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), methyl nitrosourea (MNU) and UV radiation (254 nm) were compared in the two strains. Mutability at the Na+/K+-ATPase locus as well as the HGPRT locus was determined. As previously reported, we found strain LY-S to be more resistant than strain LY-R to the lethal effects of UV radiation. In contrast, strain LY-S was more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the two alkylating agents. In spite of these differences in sensitivity, we found strain LY-S to be less mutable than strain LY-R by all 3 agents at the HGPRT locus. At the Na+/K+-ATPase locus, strain LY-S was also less mutable than strain LY-R by equal concentrations of EMS and UV radiation and by equitoxic concentrations of MNU. However, the difference between the strains was much more pronounced at the HGPRT locus than at the Na+/K+-ATPase locus. We have suggested that the interaction of unrepaired lesions in strain LY-S tends to cause an excess of deletions and multilocus effects, which in turn result in a locus-dependent decrease in the recovery of viable LY-S mutant cells.","['Evans, H H', 'Horng, M F', 'Beer, J Z']","['Evans HH', 'Horng MF', 'Beer JZ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/*toxicity', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Methylnitrosourea/*toxicity', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*genetics', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'X-Rays']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(86)90103-X [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(86)90103-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1986 Jun;161(1):91-7. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(86)90103-x.,"['CA 15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

By the indirect methods, immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay, NSE has been detected also in some nonneuroendocrine tumors, a finding that could reflect technical artifacts or the capacity for NSE expression in nonneuroendocrine tumor cells. This paper reports on the expression of NSE in human neuroendocrine and nonneuroendocrine tumor specimens and in a panel of permanent human cell lines, by using a direct (enzymatic) and an indirect (radioimmunoassay) method for determination of NSE. We detected NSE in all tested tumor specimens and neuroendocrine tumor cell lines and in a majority (21 of 24) of the nonneuroendocrine tumor cell lines. In general, neuroendocrine tumor specimens and derived tumor cell lines contained more NSE than the nonneuroendocrine tumor specimens and cell lines. However, some of the cultured hematopoietic cell lines (T leukemia and Epstein-Barr virus immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines) had NSE levels comparable to those found in some neuroblastoma and small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines.

TPA treatment resulted in an increased level of transcription of the three mRNAs and the appearance of a new 1-kilobase mRNA. At least 10 acquired MMTV proviruses are present in the EL-4 genome, and examination of the degree of proviral methylation revealed extensive demethylation.

High levels of secreted collagenase and collagenase inhibitor accompany low levels of intracellular elastase and cathepsin G.,1675-81,"Human monocytic tumor cells of the U937 cell line contain substantial quantities of two neutrophil neutral proteinases, elastase and cathepsin G, raising the question of whether their presence reflects an expression of transformation or whether normal monocytes undergo a developmental stage in which they produce certain neutrophil proteinases. To address this issue, we examined U937 cells for production of collagenase, since human alveolar macrophages release fibroblast-like collagenase, an enzyme that is distinct from neutrophil collagenase. Using an immunoassay that utilized antibody to skin fibroblast collagenase, we found that U937 cells secreted barely detectable quantities of enzyme, 10-12 ng/10(6) cells per 24 h, under basal conditions. Upon incubation with 10 nM 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), however, collagenase release increased 200-fold, comparable to the amount secreted by phorbol-stimulated human fibroblasts. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation confirmed the enhanced synthesis of U937 cell collagenase upon TPA exposure. This enzyme activity further resembled fibroblast collagenase and differed from neutrophil collagenase by exhibiting preferential cleavage of monomeric type III collagen relative to type I. As previously observed with human alveolar macrophages, U937 cells also released a protein identical to the collagenase inhibitor produced by human skin fibroblasts, a molecule not associated with neutrophils. Release of this inhibitor increased 10-fold with TPA exposure. In contrast to collagenase and collagense inhibitor, TPA-treated U937 cells contained only 10-15% as much elastase and cathepsin G activities as control cells. Thus, TPA-induced differentiation modified the presence of these enzymes in the direction of their content in normal monocytes. Since the neutral proteinase profile of undifferentiated U937 cells resembles that of neutrophils and changes markedly after cellular differentiation to one that is characteristic of monocytes, these data suggest that neutrophilic proteinases may be produced by normal monocytes during the early stages of their differentiation.","['Welgus, H G', 'Connolly, N L', 'Senior, R M']","['Welgus HG', 'Connolly NL', 'Senior RM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Phorbols)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Microbial Collagenase/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Pancreatic Elastase/*analysis', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112485 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 May;77(5):1675-81. doi: 10.1172/JCI112485.,"['AM01525/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM35805/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL29594/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC424573,,,,,,,

A similar decrease in receptor expression was observed in vivo in PBL from patients being treated daily with 5 X 10(6) units/m2 per d of IFN alpha 2 by subcutaneous injection, for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or papilloma virus infections. Receptor numbers in PBL in vivo were further reduced concurrent with the progression of IFN therapy. Thus the reduction in IFN receptor expression observed in vitro can be demonstrated in vivo. These studies indicate that monitoring IFN receptor expression in vivo can provide information regarding the availability of IFN receptors at the cell surface for the mediation of IFN actions during the course of IFN therapy.","['Lau, A S', 'Hannigan, G E', 'Freedman, M H', 'Williams, B R']","['Lau AS', 'Hannigan GE', 'Freedman MH', 'Williams BR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*analysis/drug effects', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interferon', 'Tumor Virus Infections/therapy']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112480 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 May;77(5):1632-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI112480.,,,,PMC424568,,,,,,,

To investigate the effects of this virus on T cell functions, two OKT3+, OKT4+, OKT8- cytotoxic clones (8.7 and 8.8) specific for allogeneic cells bearing DPw2, a class II histocompatibility antigen, were studied before and after infection with HTLV-I. The clones retained cytotoxic function for up to 70 d after exposure to HTLV-I, even without subsequent antigenic stimulation, but then lost their cytotoxic activity. Prior to infection with HTLV-I, clone 8.8 also lysed OKT3 hybridoma cells; after infection, cytotoxic activity against these OKT3-antibody bearing cells was lost in parallel with the loss of activity against DPw2-bearing target cells. In addition, expression of T3 surface antigen by HTLV-I-infected 8.8 cells was decreased at a time when they lost their cytotoxic activity, possibly contributing to the loss of cytotoxic function. Finally, clone 8.8 could provide help for nonspecific IgG production by autologous B cells when stimulated with irradiated DPw2-bearing non-T cells. After infection with HTLV-I, this helper function became independent of DPw2-stimulation and persisted even when the cytotoxic activity was lost. An OKT4+ T cell clone thus could simultaneously manifest both cytotoxic and helper T cell activities, and these activities were differentially affected after HTLV-I infection.","['Yarchoan, R', 'Guo, H G', 'Reitz, M Jr', 'Maluish, A', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Broder, S']","['Yarchoan R', 'Guo HG', 'Reitz M Jr', 'Maluish A', 'Mitsuya H', 'Broder S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1986/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112459 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 May;77(5):1466-73. doi: 10.1172/JCI112459.,['N01-C0-23910/PHS HHS/United States'],,,PMC424547,,,,,,,

Mitomycin C, a poor producer of I-Ad antigen-positive macrophages, selectively augmented the production of I-Ad antigen-positive macrophages in L1210 vaccine-primed mice, since it did not augment the production of non-macrophage cells. Since our previous study showed that the priming of mice with L1210 vaccine and mitomycin C induced augmented antitumor response, we tested the feasibility of the association of mitomycin C-augmented I-Ad antigen-positive macrophages with the augmented antitumor response. Prostaglandin E2 suppressed the antitumor response in L1210 vaccine- and mitomycin C-primed mice and, consistent with this, it inhibited the production of I-Ad antigen-positive macrophages, although it inhibited the production of non-macrophage cells as well. This hypothesis was further tested by the use of silica. When L1210 vaccine- and mitomycin C-primed mice were further given silica on the day of and one day after live L1210 inoculation, their antitumor response was strongly suppressed, while a kinetic analysis of the cellularity of peritoneal cells showed that administration of silica resulted in a decrease of I-Ad antigen-positive macrophages, but not I-Ad antigen-negative macrophages or non-macrophage cells in these mice.

We have now shown that this compound sensitizes human derived skin fibroblasts but to a lesser extent. Fibroblasts derived from normal, Friedreich's ataxia, and ataxia-telangiectasia individuals were equally sensitized by 3-AAB to electron radiation. 3-AAB was also effective in sensitizing the mouse lymphoma lines to fast neutron irradiation. In addition DNA strand break repair was retarded as had been found after electron irradiation. 3-Nitrobenzamide is structurally a potentially dual action radiation sensitizer with electron affinic and ADPRT inhibitory properties. It is a weaker inhibitor of ADPRT compared to 3-AAB, and results in a smaller sensitization of mouse lymphoma cells in air. However, a much greater sensitization is achieved in anoxia.

A geographical clustering of malignant lymphomas in the Kyushu districts was observed both in the period 1969-1971 and more recently in 1979-1981. The excessive rate of malignant lymphomas in Kyushu was due to the high incidence of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The distribution of healthy carriers of ATLV, a human retrovirus which is almost identical to HTLV, was closely related to that of patients with ATLL in Japan. Epidemiological features of the infectious mode of ATLV suggested two main routes of natural transmission, one from mother to child and the other from husband to wife. ATLV is considered to be a main causative agent of ATLL from virological and epidemiological evidence, but infection by this virus alone may not result in ATLL because the incidence of ATLL among ATLV carriers was apparently not very high even in endemic areas of ATLL. Thus, some risk factors other than ATLV, such as environmental and genetic factors, may contribute to the development of ATLL.","['Tajima, K', 'Tominaga, S', 'Suchi, T']","['Tajima K', 'Tominaga S', 'Suchi T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology/immunology/microbiology', 'Risk']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900040106 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1986 Jan-Mar;4(1):31-44. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900040106.,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that DDTC at doses of 25-300 mg/kg inhibits DDP-induced nephrotoxicity and bone marrow toxicity in C57BL/6 X DBA/2F1 (hereafter called B6D2F1) mice, F344 rats, and beagle dogs and is also antiemetic in the dog. DDTC doses which afford excellent protection do not decrease median survival time following DDP treatment in L1210 and P388 leukemias, B16 melanoma, and Lewis lung and colon 26 carcinomas in B6D2F1 mice when DDTC is given 2 h after DDP. Preliminary experiments indicate that DDTC does not alter median survival time after treatment of P388 leukemia with the platinum analogues diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) and cis-diisopropylamine-cis-dichloro-trans-dihydroxyplatinum(IV ). Maximum blood urea nitrogen levels after DDP treatment are reduced significantly by DDTC in all species; blood urea nitrogen elevation, total kidney platinum, weight loss, and leukopenia correlate with DDP-DDTC interval in the rat and indicate optimum protection at 2 h, the shortest interval examined. Bone marrow toxicity was assessed by peripheral white blood cell counts in all species and by marrow cellularity in the mouse. White blood cell nadirs were higher and bone marrow recovered more rapidly after DDTC compared with DDP given alone. DDP reduced marrow cellularity 50-60% in the mouse; administration of DDTC 2 h after DDP afforded no protection to the lymphocytes in the marrow but maintained the granulocyte + precursor population near control levels. DDTC plasma pharmacokinetic values have been determined after s.c., i.p., and i.v. administration in the mouse, rat, and dog. Peak plasma levels of 0.3-1.2 mM are observed after a 250-mg/kg dose, with a plasma half-life of 10-20 min.

The HR-1 virus is lytic and induces early antigen in superinfected Raji cells; the virus is not capable of transforming B-lymphocytes. Virus preparations from NPC-KT cells have both transforming and early antigen-inducing properties, while B95-8 virus can only transform B-lymphocytes. It was possible to demonstrate EBV antigens after superinfection of D98/HR-1 cells with both HR-1 virus and NPC-EBV. The NPC-KT hybrid cells, which were originally prepared by fusing human adenoid epithelial cells (Ad-AH) and EBV genome-positive NPC explanted epithelial cells, were susceptible to superinfection with HR-1 virus but not to NPC-EBV. The A2L/AH hybrid cells, which were prepared by fusion between Ad-AH cells and lymphocytes transformed by B95-8 virus, could not be superinfected with any of the virus preparations. In order to further investigate the nature of the EBV receptor as it relates to other cell membrane components, we examined cell surface markers on Ad-AH, NPC-KT, A2L/AH, and D98/HR-1 cells using monoclonal antibodies and by rosette formation. We found that the NPC-KT, A2L/AH, and Ad-AH cell lines express the OKB2 antigen and that the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen is expressed on the A2L/AH cells. We also found that NPC-KT parental cells and a clone of NPC-KT cells express erythrocyte antibody complement b and erythrocyte antibody complement d, as determined by rosette formation, but were negative for C3b and C3d when monoclonal antibodies against these two markers were used. The D98/HR-1 cells were also confirmed to be negative for C3b and C3d.

In one tumor bearing mouse there was splenomegaly and generalized enlargement of lymph nodes. Chromosomal analysis and membrane immunofluorescence revealed that cells in all the 4 s.c. tumors and a proportion of cells in the enlarged spleen and lymph nodes had human chromosomes and contained human kappa or lambda chains demonstrating that these were polyclonal human B-cells. Epstein-Barr virus associated nuclear antigen could be detected in 100% of cells in all the 4 EBV transformed B-cell lines in vitro and aliquots of cells from several s.c. tumors and metastatic lesions examined. Successful serial transplantation into irradiated nude mice was possible for at least 3 generations with one of the 4 s.c. tumors. During serial transplantation, spread of tumor cells to the spleen and lymph nodes could be detected in all the 3 passage mice investigated; however, there was no evidence in any mouse of dissemination of tumor cells into the bloodstream or into any organ other than lymph nodes and spleen. s.c. tumors also developed in a proportion of irradiated nude mice after inoculation of cells from two other s.c. tumors and the metastatic spleen and lymph nodes, but all these tumors regressed during the first or second transplant passage. Two % of PBL from the untreated patient and 4% of EBV transformed PBL maintained in vitro were found to have trisomy of chromosome 12 which is the most frequently reported anomaly associated with human CLL B-cells. It is highly probable that the cells with trisomy were derived from the leukemic clone of this patient. Cells with this trisomy predominated in most metastatic sites compared to the parent s.c. tumors. Inoculation of irradiated nude mice with EBV transformed PBL from this patient after chlorambucil therapy (100% metaphase plates with 46,XY,11q+ karyotype) or with EBV transformed PBL from 2 normal adults failed to produce any progressively growing tumor in a total of 12 irradiated animals observed greater than 300 days.

In order to confirm and extend these findings, we have examined by cytofluorography a large panel of well-characterized cell lines derived from SCCL tumors for the expression of several myeloid cell-associated antigens, some of which were not examined in previous reports. In addition, we have studied the expression of Classes I and II HLA antigens on these SCCL cell lines. Finally, we examined the effect of gamma-interferon on the expression of several cell surface markers and on proliferation of SCCL cells. We have found that several SCCL cell lines expressed a Mr 55,000 polypeptide antigen, My23, previously found only on monocytes and monocytic leukemia cells. In addition, the cell lines studied expressed another antigen, defined by monoclonal antibody AML-1-99, which is associated with monocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. We confirmed previous studies that the Leu-7 antigenic determinant is expressed on SCCL cells but observed only minimal or absent binding of monoclonal antibody OKM1 to most cell lines. Class I HLA antigens were present on eight of nine lines examined while Class II HLA was expressed on three of nine lines. Gamma-Interferon decreased the proliferative rate of all lines examined. However, this lymphokine was capable of inducing Class I HLA on several lines. The effect of gamma-interferon on other cell surface antigens was variable. These studies confirm that some myeloid cell-associated antigens are expressed on cultured SCCL lines and, additionally, show that their expression can be modulated by immune interferon.

HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate along the PMN pathway by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Uninduced HL-60 cells were found to be completely devoid of PMA-DCC and ADCC activity. DMSO-induced cells progressively acquired the capacity to kill ORBC and to undergo the activation of oxidative metabolic burst when triggered by PMA. Despite approximately 40% of them also were capable of binding IgG-sensitized ORBC, no ADCC activity and respiratory burst activation was observed: this finding indicates that maturing HL-60 cells require a more complete maturation than that induced by DMSO to actually exert ADCC. Together the results suggest that: a. the acquirement of both PMA-DCC and ADCC potential is a post-promyelocytic event; b. the cytotoxicity activating stimuli, PMA and IgG-coated targets, follow different post-receptor transductional pathways to trigger the effector cell lytic systems: only the PMA receptor-linked pathway develops during DMSO-driven differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Dallegri, F', 'Ballestrero, A', 'Frumento, G', 'Patrone, F']","['Dallegri F', 'Ballestrero A', 'Frumento G', 'Patrone F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Receptors, Fc)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/physiology', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00321084 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1986 Apr;52(4):243-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00321084.,,,,,,,,,,,

With normal human phagocytic cells there is both superoxide anion (O2-) production and chemotaxis in response to chemoattractants such as N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). We have now found that although HL-60 cells induced with RA alone produce O2- in response to 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) they are deficient in FMLP-stimulated O2- production and chemotaxis. In contrast, HL-60 induced either with DMF or with a combination of 10 nmol/L RA and a T cell-derived lymphokine, differentiation-inducing activity (DIA), produce O2- and exhibit chemotaxis in response to FMLP. The basis for these results appears to be the concentration of cell surface chemotactic peptide receptors. Thus, untreated HL-60 and HL-60 induced with either RA alone or DIA alone do not have measurable levels of FMLP receptors, whereas HL-60 induced with a combination of RA and DIA has 5,400 receptors per cell. HL-60 induced with RA and DIA plus 1 mumol/L dexamethasone have 25,000 receptors per cell and have greater chemotactic activity than HL-60 induced with the combination of RA and DIA. Thus, differentiation of HL-60 to cells with many properties of normal phagocytes can be induced in vitro by physiologic substances.","['Imaizumi, M', 'Breitman, T R']","['Imaizumi M', 'Breitman TR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (lymphocyte proliferation potentiating factors)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/metabolism', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Phagocytes/cytology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79845-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 May;67(5):1273-80.,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we demonstrate that the monoclonal antibody 42/6 to human transferrin receptor inhibits iron uptake in the human leukemic K562 cell line and suppresses hemoglobin accumulation in K562 cells induced to erythroid differentiation by butyric acid. In contrast, only slight inhibitory effects were observed on cell proliferation of both uninduced and erythroid-induced K562 cells treated with the 42/6 monoclonal antibody. In addition, the 42/6 monoclonal antibody to human transferrin receptor does not inhibit butyric acid-induced accumulation of gamma-globin mRNA. The effect of the 42/6 monoclonal antibody on hemoglobin synthesis appears to be restricted to human cell lines, as murine Friend erythroleukemic cells undergo erythroid differentiation when cultured in the presence of hexamethylenebisacetamide plus the 42/6 monoclonal antibody. The findings reported in this paper suggest (a) a dissociation of iron transport and accumulation of heme molecules from the expression of globin genes and (b) a different requirement of iron uptake by different iron-dependent functions such as cell proliferation and hemoglobin expression.","['Gambari, R', 'Barbieri, R', 'Buzzoni, D', 'Bernardi, F', 'Marchetti, G', 'Amelotti, F', 'Piva, R', 'Viola, L', 'del Senno, L']","['Gambari R', 'Barbieri R', 'Buzzoni D', 'Bernardi F', 'Marchetti G', 'Amelotti F', 'Piva R', 'Viola L', 'del Senno L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin']",1986/04/29 00:00,1986/04/29 00:01,['1986/04/29 00:00'],"['1986/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(86)90138-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(86)90138-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Apr 29;886(2):203-13. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(86)90138-2.,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of degranulation, i.e., release of myeloperoxidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase- and myeloperoxidase-mediated iodination by HL60 cells, suggested that the defective chemiluminescence response observed in HL60 cells may be due to impaired release of myeloperoxidase from azurophilic granulae.

These new viruses are XC negative and serologically cross-react with MCF env antigens but are ecotropic in host range, being able to only infect mouse cells to varying degrees and unable to infect mink or other cells infectable by MCF or xenotropic viruses. Viruses of this type from AKR mice cross-interfere with Moloney ecotropic and MCF viruses in SC-1 cells and appear to have properties similar to those of the SL3-2, GPA-V2, and R-XC- isolates.

This translocation relocates the proto-oncogene c-abl, normally found on chromosome 9q34, to within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) on chromosome 22q11 (refs 3-8). The juxtaposition of c-abl and the 5' portion of bcr appears to be the critical genomic event in CML and results in a novel 8-kilobase (kb) fused abl/bcr transcript and a c-abl-related protein of relative molecular mass 210,000 (ref.11). About 10% of adult patients diagnosed as CML lack the Ph' chromosome; they represent a heterogeneous group of disorders which are difficult to diagnose precisely. We have examined five patients with CML whose leukaemic cells have a normal karyotype. We report here that two of the patients showed the same genomic change as occurs in Ph'-positive CML, but the change resulted from a mechanism other than chromosomal translocation. The remaining three patients showed no genomic rearrangement.

We show here that based on the spontaneous plating efficiencies of their T-CFC, two groups of patients can be established: Group A (10 patients) with a high colony number (more than 100 colonies/10(5) seeded cells), and group B (12 patients) with less than 100 colonies/10(5) cells. The addition of interleukin 2-(IL2) containing PHA-leukocyte conditioned medium enhanced colony growth from group B but not group A patients. Moreover, both biochemically purified and recombinant IL2 induced the colony growth from group B but not group A patients without any other stimulation. In addition, a monoclonal antibody (moAb) against the IL2 receptor (IL2-R; anti-Tac) inhibited the spontaneous colony formation from T-CFC of both groups of patients. These observations strongly suggest that IL2-R are involved in the spontaneous colony growth of T-CFC. To determine whether IL2 is also involved in the spontaneous colony formation, media conditioned (LCM) by unstimulated leukemic cells were tested for IL2 activity. A constitutive release of IL2 was detected in LCM from only 2 out of 10 patients tested, and some of them were capable to inhibit thymidine incorporation by IL2-dependent cells cultured in the presence of highly purified IL2. However, most of these LCM contained a T-cell colony-promoting activity (TCPA) inducing colony formation from both normal resting and PHA-stimulated E+ clonogenic cells without added IL2 or mitogenic stimulation. TCPA-containing LCM induced the expression of functional IL2-R and IL2 release by normal resting lymphocytes. TCPA was constitutively released by blast-enriched cell fractions suggesting that it is released by the leukemic cells.","['Georgoulias, V', 'Triebel, F', 'Kosmatopoulos, C', 'Allouche, M', 'Gluckman, J C', 'Mathe, G', 'Jasmin, C']","['Georgoulias V', 'Triebel F', 'Kosmatopoulos C', 'Allouche M', 'Gluckman JC', 'Mathe G', 'Jasmin C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/analysis', 'Culture Media', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90072-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(4):419-27. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90072-x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, immunoreactions to gp55 and gp34 were found not to be directed to the carbohydrate moieties of these glycoproteins. Similar results were obtained by assays of human immunoglobulin binding to Western blots of MuMTV proteins. These increased MuMTV-specific immunoreactivities, in general, were found to be related to degree and length of exposure to this virus.

By direct and absorption analyses with 28 B6 and BALB/c leukemias, the monoclonal antibodies NU7-4 and NU7-99 were shown to react only with B6RV2, indicating that they recognized an individually distinct antigen on B6RV2 that was identified previously with conventional (BALB/c X B6)F1 anti-B6RV2 serum. Another monoclonal antibody, NU1-132, showed relatively restricted reactivity with B6 RadLV leukemias. These three monoclonal antibodies all precipitated material of approximately 80,000 daltons, which is the same size as that precipitated by anti-xenotropic MuLV gp70 serum.

As opposed to an inhibitory effect, we found that the conditioned medium (CM) from FEA or FEA/FeLV increased the in vitro growth of multiple hematopoietic progenitor cell types including erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E), granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming cells, megakaryocytic colony-forming cells, and mixed-cell colony-forming cells. Furthermore, CM enhanced the growth of progenitors in cultures of mouse or human marrow cells, as well as cat marrow cells. Stimulation of feline BFU-E was most marked with an increment in growth of 400% over control. The human burst promoting activity (BPA) of the CM was equivalent or better than other CM available in our laboratory. The evidence suggest that the growth-promoting activity is a constitutive product(s) released by FEA which was enhanced eightfold with virus infection. Studies with non-adherent and T-lymphocyte-depleted human marrow cells and human peripheral blood cells suggest that the growth factor(s) acts directly on progenitor cells and not through readily identified accessory cells. These findings are consistent with the concept that mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts have the capacity to release hematopoietic growth factor(s) capable of acting on primitive hematopoietic progenitors.

It contains three regions: a KpnI repeat, a unique cellular region (UCR), and the U3 + R sequence of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I LTR. The arrangement of this clone suggests that its RNA transcript was activated by provirus integration in cis, possibly by the activity of a downstream provirus enhancer.

Modulation by lysosomotropic agents and monensin.,424-31,"Myeloperoxidase, stored in azurophil granules of neutrophils, is synthesized in promyelocytes as a larger molecular weight precursor, which is processed to yield a transient Mr 82 000 intermediate and mature polypeptides with molecular weights of 62 000 and 12 000. We have tried to define subcellular sites for processing using metabolic labelling of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 in combination with subcellular fractionation on a Percoll gradient. A reasonable separation was achieved between azurophil granules, Golgi elements and endoplasmic reticulum. The finding of almost exclusively fully processed myeloperoxidase in granules and a mixture of unprocessed and processed polypeptide in fractions enriched in Golgi elements suggests that processing occurred mainly in pregranular structures. Monensin, which exchanges protons for Na+, and the base chloroquine blocked processing probably by inhibition of transport through the Golgi apparatus. However, the lysosomotropic NH4+ cation did not inhibit processing or transport indicating that processing is not necessarily influenced by pH-dependent mechanisms. Results from digestion with endoglycosidase H, incubation with tunicamycin and metabolic labelling with [3H]mannose indicated that myeloperoxidase contained high mannose oligosaccharide side chains. Also [32P]phosphate incorporated into Mr 90 000 and Mr 62 000 myeloperoxidase was susceptible to endoglycosidase H indicating that oligosaccharide side chains are modified by phosphorylation as in lysosomal enzymes. Thus, even if myeloperoxidase contained mannose 6-phosphate residues, these may not necessarily be involved in directing transport to the azurophil granules.","['Stromberg, K', 'Persson, A M', 'Olsson, I']","['Stromberg K', 'Persson AM', 'Olsson I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Furans)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Body Fluids/*enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1986 Jan;39(2):424-31.,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnoses were confirmed by characteristic findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsies. For IFN treatment we initially used natural IFN-alpha (Bioferon) and switched later to recombinant IFN-alpha2 (Boehringer). MNC of 5 patients before IFN therapy and of 6 patients during IFN therapy (2-47 weeks) were induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Corynebacterium parvum (C.p.), and sendai virus (SV). PHA is known to induce IFN-gamma. Both, C.p. and SV induced IFN-alpha but no IFN-gamma in MNC of healthy controls and of IFN treated breast cancer patients. In HCL patients normal antiviral activities could be induced by PHA. Zero or only low antiviral activities could be induced in MNC from 9 patients tested on 22 occasions. It is concluded that MNC from patients with advanced HCL can be induced to produce IFN-gamma but no IFN-alpha. Since IFN-alpha but not IFN-gamma is produced by monocytes it is likely that reduced numbers of monocytes which were found in our HCL patients before and during IFN treatment account for the described deficiency of IFN-alpha production.","['Porzsolt, F', 'Janik, R', 'Heil, G', 'Brudler, O', 'Raghavachar, A', 'Scholz, S', 'Papendick, U', 'Heimpel, H']","['Porzsolt F', 'Janik R', 'Heil G', 'Brudler O', 'Raghavachar A', 'Scholz S', 'Papendick U', 'Heimpel H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/biosynthesis/*deficiency/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human/metabolism', 'Propionibacterium acnes/metabolism']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320535 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1986 Mar;52(3):185-90. doi: 10.1007/BF00320535.,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells produce large quantities of enzymatically active MPO that has the same electrophoretic behavior as MPO isolated from normal PMNs. Mature MPO is a glycoprotein of approximately 150,000 molecular weight (mol wt) composed of two heavy-light protomers (alpha 2 beta 2) with subunits of 59,000 and 13,500 mol wt, respectively, under reducing conditions. The primary translation product of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from HL-60 cells was a single polypeptide of mol wt 80,000. In HL-60 cells labeled with [35S]-methionine, the labeled MPO isolated by immunoprecipitation had a mol wt of 89,000. Treatment of this 89-kilodalton (kDa) species with endoglycosidase H produced a 79-kDa peptide, suggesting that the 89-kDa protein contained high-mannose side chains. The 89-kDa species had no detectable peroxidase activity. During chase experiments some of the 89-kDa peptide was processed to smaller species of mol wt 39,000, 59,000, and 13,500, although a fraction of the 89-kDa peptide remained unprocessed after a chase of 100 hours. In addition, a small amount of the 89-kDa peptide appeared in the medium without any of the processed smaller peptides. These studies suggest that the primary translation product in MPO biosynthesis is an 80-kDa peptide that undergoes cotranslational cleavage of the signal peptide and glycosylation to produce an 89-kDa pro-MPO, that pro-MPO is a single polypeptide containing the alpha and beta subunits of MPO and contains endoglycosidase H-susceptible high-mannose side chains, and that posttranslational modification of pro-MPO results in targeting to the lysosome and proteolytic maturation of pro-MPO to active enzyme. In light of the previous observation that MPO-deficient and normal PMNs contain an 89-kDa protein immunochemically related to MPO, these studies on MPO biosynthesis indirectly support the hypothesis that defective posttranslation processing by pro-MPO may underlie hereditary MPO deficiency.","['Nauseef, W M']",['Nauseef WM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Precursors/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/*biosynthesis/deficiency/isolation & purification', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Subcellular Fractions/analysis']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81250-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Apr;67(4):865-72.,"['I01 BX000513/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 AI020866/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-20866/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 05372/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In synchronized cultures at the beginning of the mitotic cycle, the bulk of ATP resynthesized via glycolysis is utilized for the synthesis of biopolymers, whereas that at the end of the S-phase and in the G2-phase--for cation transport across plasma membranes. From 35 to 100% of the whole amount of ATP resynthesized via glycolysis is utilized for transport purposes. The experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that in glucose-containing media Na+ transport increases from 0.75 to 1.78 pmol/hour on a per cell basis. The activation of Na+ transport is due to the exchange of protons formed via glucose conversion into lactate for Na+, i.e., to the stimulation of Na+/H+ antiport.

It is concluded that the observed increase in the Na+/K+ ratio in ascite tumour cells is connected with their enhanced ability to synthesize lactic acid.

In the current work, an activity characterized by the production of DNA-protein links associated with DNA strand breaks and by stimulation by m-AMSA was isolated from L1210 cell nuclei and was shown to be due to topoisomerase II. Nuclei were extracted with 0.35 M NaCl, and the extract was fractionated by gel filtration, DNA-cellulose chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. A rapid filter binding assay was devised to monitor the fractionation procedure on the basis of DNA-protein linking activity. The active DNA-cellulose fraction contained both topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II whereas the glycerol gradient purified material contained only topoisomerase II activity. The properties of the active material were studied at both stages of purification. m-AMSA enhanced the formation of complexes between purified topoisomerase II and SV40 DNA in which the DNA sustained a single- or double-strand cut and the enzyme was covalently linked to the 5' terminus of the DNA. This action was further enhanced by ATP, as well as by nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues. m-AMSA inhibited the topoisomerization and catenation reactions of topoisomerase II, probably because of trapping of the enzyme-DNA complexes. The activity showed a dependence on the type of DNA intercalators used, analogous to what was previously observed in intact cells. m-AMSA had no effect on topoisomerase I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Minford, J', 'Pommier, Y', 'Filipski, J', 'Kohn, K W', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Mattern, M', 'Michaels, S', 'Schwartz, R', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Minford J', 'Pommier Y', 'Filipski J', 'Kohn KW', 'Kerrigan D', 'Mattern M', 'Michaels S', 'Schwartz R', 'Zwelling LA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Simian virus 40', 'Thermodynamics']",1986/01/14 00:00,1986/01/14 00:01,['1986/01/14 00:00'],"['1986/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00349a002 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1986 Jan 14;25(1):9-16. doi: 10.1021/bi00349a002.,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the activities of these enzymes in the circulating malignant cells of 35 patients with chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia and have correlated the biochemical data with immunological phenotypes. Classification of the cases into those without evidence of secretory activity ('true' CLL, 14 patients) and those with cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (CIg) ('immunocytoma'; 21 patients) revealed that immunocytomas are phenotypically and biochemically associated with more mature features. Malignant cells without CIg were characterized by low activities of ADA, PNP and 5'NT. In malignant cells with evidence of secretory activity (immunocytoma), low activity of ADA was also observed, but the activities of PNP and 5'NT were relatively high and approached the range of normal B lymphocytes. The differences in PNP (P less than 0.05) and in 5'NT (P less than 0.01) between these two groups were significant. Phenotypically the cells without CIg were predominantly associated with IgM (+k light chains) as surface membrane immunoglobulin (SmIg) whereas expression of IgG was more often observed in the leukaemic cells with CIg. No correlation between enzyme patterns and the stage of the disease was apparent. Thus both biochemical and immunological criteria show that cases of CLL vary within a range of maturity and that those with CIg might be more mature in the B cell axis. The present study emphasizes the value of purine enzyme studies in defining subsets of B cell neoplasia.","['Ho, A D', 'Dorken, B', 'Ma, D D', 'Pezzutto, A', 'Hunstein, W', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Ho AD', 'Dorken B', 'Ma DD', 'Pezzutto A', 'Hunstein W', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Adenosine Deaminase/*blood', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*blood', 'Nucleotidases/*blood', 'Pentosyltransferases/*blood', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*blood', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02967.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Mar;62(3):545-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02967.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-III-seropositive hemophiliac subjects, on average, had been exposed to twice as much concentrate during the previous year as seronegative hemophiliac subjects. The seropositive group had a significantly lower mean helper/suppressor T cell ratio and absolute helper T cell level than the seronegative group.

The prevalence of lymphadenopathy or AIDS among HTLV-III-seropositive hemophiliac subjects was 54 percent (13 of 24).

HL-A typing is of practical interest for diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis by B27 antigen determination and for prevention of idiopathic hemochromatosis by genotyping of siblings of the index case. Prenatal diagnosis of 21-OH deficiency by genotyping fetal cells permits genetic counseling. Indeed, the discovery of the relationship between HL-A and disease can be considered a new approach to medical genetics.

LSA-1 cells possessed surface receptors and antigens of normal T-lymphocytes, but were unresponsive to interleukin-2 stimulation. The LSA cell-line was found to constitutively produce and release an interferon into the culture supernatants. Production of this interferon was enhanced in certain clones of the original LSA-1 cell lines. The interferon produced by LSA-1 cells and some of its clones was compared to the standard alpha, beta, and gamma interferons of cats. Unlike alpha and beta interferons, which were acid, SDS, and heat stable, LSA interferon was acid labile and SDS and heat stable. In comparison, standard feline gamma interferon was acid, SDS, and heat labile. LSA interferon had a molecular weight of 20,000 daltons, compared to 17-19,000 daltons for gamma, 19-25,000 for beta, and 25-45,000 daltons for alpha interferons. Standard feline interferons were active only on cat cell lines, with the exceptions of alpha interferon, which also reacted with MDCK canine cells. LSA interferon resembled the standard feline alpha interferon because it also reacted with feline and canine cells. It was concluded that LSA interferon was an atypical acid labile alpha interferon, resembling in this respect the abnormal alpha interferon seen in humans with AIDS and SLE, and mice with retrovirus infections. LSA-1 cells produced high levels of FeLV structural proteins but very little infectious virus. This effect was due to endogenously produced interferon; LSA cell clones that were selected for low interferon production produced much higher levels of infectious FeLV than parent cells or clones selected for high interferon production. Cat cells pretreated with LSA or with standard feline alpha and beta interferons, and then infected with FeLV, produced high levels of FeLV proteins but very little infectious virus.","['Yamamoto, J K', 'Ho, E', 'Pedersen, N C']","['Yamamoto JK', 'Ho E', 'Pedersen NC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Acids)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Acids', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Interferon Type I/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/physiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/*immunology/microbiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(86)90084-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(86)90084-x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1986 Jan;11(1):1-19. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(86)90084-x.,['CA-39016-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The bovine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (BLV LTR) functions as a transcriptional promoter only in cell lines productively infected with BLV. Deletion mapping indicated that at least two regions of the LTR, on the 5' and 3' sides of the RNA start site, influenced gene expression. An analysis has now been made of the effects of coupling sequences from these LTR regions to a heterologous core promoter derived from the SV40 early promoter unit. Through the use of the transient expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to monitor transcriptional activity in vivo, two independent, regulatory elements were identified in the BLV LTR. One was present in a fragment of 75 base pairs derived from the U3 region of the LTR and behaved much like other enhancer elements. It may be a major determinant of BLV expression in productively infected cell lines, since it enhanced transcription controlled by the heterologous core promoter only in these cells. The second element was contained in a 250-bp fragment derived from LTR sequences in the R region, located downstream from the RNA start site. Its activation of CAT expression was not dependent on BLV infection and was evident only when the fragment was located immediately downstream from the RNA start site. BLV expression thus appears to be regulated in part by a cell-specific enhancer element upstream from the core promoter and a novel sequence downstream from the RNA initiation site in the viral LTR.","['Derse, D', 'Casey, J W']","['Derse D', 'Casey JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/03/21 00:00,1986/03/21 00:01,['1986/03/21 00:00'],"['1986/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.3006241 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1986 Mar 21;231(4744):1437-40. doi: 10.1126/science.3006241.,['CA07392/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The reaction was dependent on Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine and was stimulated by phorbol esters. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but not cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, was also able to phosphorylate the topoisomerase. Phosphorylation of topoisomerase II by protein kinase C resulted in appreciable activation of the topoisomerase, suggesting that it may represent a possible target for the regulation of nuclear events by protein kinase C. This possibility is supported by the finding that the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells was blocked by the topoisomerase II inhibitors novobiocin and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide(m-AMSA), but not by the inactive analog o-AMSA.","['Sahyoun, N', 'Wolf, M', 'Besterman, J', 'Hsieh, T', 'Sander, M', 'LeVine, H 3rd', 'Chang, K J', 'Cuatrecasas, P']","['Sahyoun N', 'Wolf M', 'Besterman J', 'Hsieh T', 'Sander M', 'LeVine H 3rd', 'Chang KJ', 'Cuatrecasas P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', ""51264-17-6 (4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-o-anisidide)"", 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Novobiocin/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.6.1603 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(6):1603-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.6.1603.,,,,PMC323131,,,,,,,

GPIIb is a two-chain protein containing disulfide-linked alpha and beta subunits. GPIIb and GPIIIa are present as a heterodimeric, noncovalent complex in the platelet plasma membrane and function as the fibrinogen receptor. To characterize synthesis of these two proteins, RNA isolated from a human leukemia cell line that contains GPIIb and GPIIIa was translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. Polyclonal antibodies specific for each protein immunoprecipitated distinct [35S]methionine-labeled precursors, indicating that GPIIb and GPIIIa are translated from separate mRNAs. Moreover, using specific antibodies against either intact unreduced GPIIb or the beta subunit, we obtained evidence for synthesis of a common polypeptide precursor for GPIIb alpha and GPIIb beta. Based on experiments using microsomal membranes, it appears that GPIIb is integrated into the platelet membrane with little or no cytoplasmic component. These results suggest that precursors of GPIIb and GPIIIa may be encoded by separate genes and that each precursor is processed before delivery to the plasma membrane.","['Bray, P F', 'Rosa, J P', 'Lingappa, V R', 'Kan, Y W', 'McEver, R P', 'Shuman, M A']","['Bray PF', 'Rosa JP', 'Lingappa VR', 'Kan YW', 'McEver RP', 'Shuman MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/immunology']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.5.1480 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(5):1480-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.5.1480.,"['CA 09436A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 31626/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 33277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC323100,,,,,,,

Report of 82 cases.,124-34,"The present report describes the clinical and laboratory profile of 82 previously healthy individuals who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced mononucleosis. Many of these patients posed initial diagnostic problems and were hospitalized with diagnoses such as fever of undetermined origin, active viral hepatitis, acute leukemia, probable systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and severe pancytopenia. These patients underwent a variety of diagnostic biopsies, including liver biopsies (6) and bone marrow aspirations (9). Four patients had exploratory laparotomies, 1 for a ruptured spleen, and another had a splenectomy following an erroneous initial diagnosis of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. There was no apparent clinical response to a short course of steroid therapy in 3 of 5 cases and acyclovir in another. The vast majority of these patients demonstrated infectious mononucleosis-type reactive blood smears, negative heterophil antibody studies, mildly or moderately elevated aspartate aminotransferase activity, and evidence for subclinical hemolysis on serial specimens. The peak serum bilirubin levels were above 2.0 mg/dl in only 2 of 71 cases tested, both of the latter patients having significant hemolysis (hemoglobin values 8.6-9.3 g/dl). The CMV-IgM test had a high sensitivity for detection of CMV macroglobulins (positive in 81 of 82 cases). In contrast, complement-fixing antibodies to CMV showed diagnostic four-fold titer changes in only 39/82 cases (47.6%). Despite its great sensitivity, the CMV-IgM test is limited by a one-way crossreaction of acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-IM sera and spurious positive reactions in some sera due to the presence of rheumatoid factors. Based on EBV-specific serologic studies, the 82 patients with CMV-IM could be divided into 4 groups: 3 patients without antibodies to EBV; 2) 69 patients with uncomplicated serologic data indicative of long-past EBV infections; (3) 6 patients with unusual antibody profiles, e.g., anti-D responses; and (4) 5 patients, including 1 originally susceptible to EBV, with apparent dual CMV/EBV infections. At the conclusion of our study, final diagnoses and initial hematologic data were correlated in 750 cases in which CMV macroglobulins were searched for. The vast majority of patients with active CMV infections initially demonstrated either markedly or moderately reactive peripheral blood smears. These data support our impression that diagnostic tests for CMV, as well as for EBV, are seldom indicated in symptomatic previously healthy patients whose blood smears during the acute phase (first several weeks) of their illnesses are either nonreactive or minimally reactive.","['Horwitz, C A', 'Henle, W', 'Henle, G', 'Snover, D', 'Rudnick, H', 'Balfour, H H Jr', 'Mazur, M H', 'Watson, R', 'Schwartz, B', 'Muller, N']","['Horwitz CA', 'Henle W', 'Henle G', 'Snover D', 'Rudnick H', 'Balfour HH Jr', 'Mazur MH', 'Watson R', 'Schwartz B', 'Muller N']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Serologic Tests', 'Syndrome']",1986/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005792-198603000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1986 Mar;65(2):124-34. doi: 10.1097/00005792-198603000-00005.,['N01-CA-33324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-four patients were treated regularly by clotting factor concentrates and 7 patients had been substituted only 1 to 4 times. Almost all patients with severe hemophilia suffered from hepatopathy. No patient had clinical evidence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Asymptomatic hemophiliacs showed a decreased number of T-helper (OKT 4) cells and an increased number of T-suppressor (OKT 8) cells, which resulted in an inversed OKT 4/OKT 8 cell ratio. Natural killer cell activity of all patients was decreased compared to controls. After culture there was no significant difference of NK cell activity between hemophiliacs and controls. This phenomena was interpreted as a possible maturation defect of NK-cells in vivo. No relationship between immunological alterations and hepatopathy, hepatitis markers, CMV antibodies, amount and source of required factor concentrates, and the kind of hemophilia was observed. IgG immunoglobulins were higher and the OKT 4/OKT 8 ratio lower in the eight patients with lymphadenopathy than in patients without lymphadenopathy. The prevalence of antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLVIII) was measured in 35 hemophiliacs and in 25 polytransfused patients, most of whom were suffering from acute leukemia. In 8 of 35 hemophiliacs antibodies to HTLVIII virus were detected by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmatory tests. All seropositive patients were treated by blood products from the United States. Eight hemophiliacs treated by factor concentrates from German donors only were seronegative. In comparison 2 of 25 examined non-hemophilia patients receiving multiple blood products from local donors were seropositive for HTLVIII. The results show that hemophilia patients treated by imported clotting factor concentrates have a high risk of HTLVIII positivity. Hemophiliacs substituted by blood products obtained by local donor pools have only a small risk of infection. Because non-hemophiliac polytransfused patients had HTLVIII antibodies, there must be asymptomatic virus carriers in the local donor pool. The HTLVIII antibody screening of all donors and the heat treating of factor concentrates will give better therapeutic safety.","['Seifried, E', 'Pindur, G', 'Stotter, H', 'Porzsolt, F', 'Rasche, H', 'Erfle, V', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Heimpel, H']","['Seifried E', 'Pindur G', 'Stotter H', 'Porzsolt F', 'Rasche H', 'Erfle V', 'Hehlmann R', 'Heimpel H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/transmission', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Child', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Factor VIII/therapeutic use', 'HIV Antibodies', 'Hemophilia A/*immunology/therapy', 'Hemophilia B/*immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/transmission', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1986/02/03 00:00,1986/02/03 00:01,['1986/02/03 00:00'],"['1986/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01732634 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1986 Feb 3;64(3):115-24. doi: 10.1007/BF01732634.,,,,,,,,,,,

By restriction analysis, we found that BL/VL3 cells harbor three related but different ecotropic RadLVs. Their restriction map differs significantly from those of primary RadLVs. Hybridization analysis also indicated that BL/VL3 and primary RadLVs differ in their p15E and long terminal repeat (LTR) regions. As compared with the LTR sequence of the putative parental endogenous ecotropic provirus, the LTR sequence of primary weakly leukemogenic RadLV has only one change, a C-rich sequence, generating a 6-base-pair direct repeat just in front of the promotor. The LTR of the primary nonleukemogenic RadLV only showed few base changes, mainly clustered in R and U5. The LTR from a moderately leukemogenic passaged BL/VL3 RadLV had conserved the C-rich sequence and acquired a 43-base-pair direct repeat in U3 and several other point mutations, small insertions, and deletions scattered in U3, R, and U5. All cloned primary RadLVs were fibrotropic, and some were weakly leukemogenic. All cloned BL/VL3 RadLVs were thymotropic and nonfibrotropic. The block of their replication was found to be after the synthesis of unintegrated linear and supercoiled viral DNA. Most of the BL/VL3 RadLVs were moderately leukemogenic, and one (V-13) was highly leukemogenic, being as virulent as the Moloney strain. We propose a model for the emergence of the RadLV variants and show that the virus responsible for the high leukemogenic potential of BL/VL3 preparation is a nondefective, ecotropic, lymphotropic, nonfibrotropic, unique retrovirus which most likely arose from a parental primary RadLV similar to those studied here.","['Rassart, E', 'Shang, M', 'Boie, Y', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Rassart E', 'Shang M', 'Boie Y', 'Jolicoeur P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymoma/etiology/*microbiology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.58.1.96-106.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Apr;58(1):96-106. doi: 10.1128/JVI.58.1.96-106.1986.,,,,PMC252881,"['GENBANK/M13079', 'GENBANK/M13080', 'GENBANK/M13081', 'GENBANK/M13082']",,,,,,

Both polypeptides are derived from a stretch of 22 amino acids within Pr76 that separates p19 and p10. We refer to this region as p2. Together the two cleavage products form the entire p2 region. The junctions of p19 with the amino-terminal fragment of p2 and of p10 with the carboxy-terminal fragment of p2 define two new processing sites within the gag precursor, Tyr-155-His-156 and Gly-177-Ser-178. Both polypeptides are major cleavage products of Pr76 that occur in Prague C Rous sarcoma virus at an estimated 1,000 copies per virion. They also are prominent components of avian myeloblastosis virus. The combination of gel filtration and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, which was used for the isolation of the two fragments of p2, resolved over a dozen other low-molecular-weight polypeptides from avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses that previously were undetected.

A chemical analysis of the protease, including an amino acid composition and NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, revealed that it has an Mr of 14,000 and is encoded by a segment of the viral RNA located between the gag gene and the putative reverse transcriptase gene. As expected from the nucleotide sequence data (Rice et al., Virology 142:357-377, 1985), the reading frame for the protease is different from both the gag and reverse transcriptase reading frames. The 5' end of the protease open reading frame extends 38 codons upstream from the codon for the NH2-terminal residue of the mature viral protease and overlaps the gag open reading frame by 7 codons. The 3' end of the protease open reading frame extends 26 codons beyond the codon for the COOH-terminal residue of the mature protease and overlaps 8 codons of the reverse transcriptase open reading frame. Several lines of evidence, such as protein mapping of the gag polyprotein precursor, the characteristic structure of the mRNA, and promotion of the synthesis of a gag polyprotein precursor by lysine tRNA in vitro, suggest that the protease could be translated by frameshift suppression of the gag termination codon. In vitro synthesized bovine leukemia virus gag-related polyproteins were cleaved by the protease into fragments which were the same size as the known components of bovine leukemia virus, suggesting that the specificity of cleavage catalyzed in vitro by the purified protease is the same as the specificity of cleavage found in the virus.","['Yoshinaka, Y', 'Katoh, I', 'Copeland, T D', 'Smythers, G W', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Yoshinaka Y', 'Katoh I', 'Copeland TD', 'Smythers GW', 'Oroszlan S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Codon', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/analysis/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.57.3.826-832.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Mar;57(3):826-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.57.3.826-832.1986.,['N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC252811,,,,,,,

The enhancer present in the HTLV-I LTR was active in uninfected cells of lymphoid and nonlymphoid origin.

This cell fusion specifically requires the presence of an ecotropic MuLV-producing parent and is not observed for cells producing xenotropic, amphotropic, or dualtropic viruses. Mouse cells infected with nonecotropic viruses retain their sensitivity toward fusion, whereas infection with ecotropic viruses abrogates the fusion of these cells upon cocultivation with other ecotropic MuLV-producing cells. Nonmurine cells lacking the ecotropic gp70 receptor are not fused under similar conditions. Fusion is effectively inhibited by monospecific antisera to gp70, but not by antisera to p15(E), and studies with monoclonal antibodies identify distinct amino- and carboxy-terminal gp70 regions which play a role in the fusion reaction.

The compounds differ in the configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 4' position. Epirubicin, like doxorubicin, exerts its antitumor effects by interference with the synthesis and function of DNA and is most active during the S phase of the cell cycle. Epirubicin is administered by intravenous (IV) injection. It is metabolized by the liver and primarily eliminated in the bile. About 10% of the drug is eliminated in the urine. Dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with liver metastases or elevated liver function tests. The elimination half-life of epirubicin is 30 to 40 hours. Clinical studies indicate activity in breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, ovarian cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, and pancreatic cancer. There is also evidence of activity against gastric cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and acute leukemia. Epirubicin has limited activity as a single agent against head and neck tumors or non-small-cell lung cancer, but may be beneficial in combination with other agents. The overall activity of epirubicin appears to be comparable with that of doxorubicin. However, more studies are needed to define its role in combination chemotherapeutic regimens. The acute dose-limiting toxicity of epirubicin is myelosuppression. Nausea, vomiting, and alopecia are also common. Epirubicin may cause transient cardiac arrhythmias and alterations of the electrocardiogram. Chronic therapy is limited, but available data indicate that epirubicin can be administered in higher cumulative doses than doxorubicin before cardiotoxicity limits further therapy.","['Cersosimo, R J', 'Hong, W K']","['Cersosimo RJ', 'Hong WK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Epirubicin', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Rectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.3.425 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Mar;4(3):425-39. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.3.425.,,100,,,,,,,,,

III. Coordinate alterations in viral gp70 antigen expression and restoration of CTL-susceptibility to insusceptible variant tumors.,2271-9,"Two variant subclones, called cl.18-5 and cl.18-12, were derived from the AKR.H-2bSL1 tumor cell line that were, in contrast to the parental cells, selectively insusceptible to H-2-restricted anti-AKR/Gross virus cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Cell surface expression of viral envelope (env) and group-specific antigens (gag) on these CTL-resistant variants were analyzed and compared with the expression of these antigens on AKR.H-2bSL1 and two other CTL-susceptible clones, cl.1 and cl.5, also derived from AKR.H-2bSL1. Although normal levels of gag-encoded and H-2 antigens were displayed on the CTL-resistant variants, the expression of five distinct determinants of viral gp70 antigen as defined by monoclonal antibodies was significantly decreased on these CTL-resistant variants relative to their expression on the CTL-susceptible cell lines. However, similar dramatic changes in cell surface gp70 antigen expression were undetectable as defined by anti-gp70-specific antiserum. Immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that gp70 molecules from cl.18-5 cells had a lower m.w. than those of AKR.H-2bSL1, but there were no differences in the m.w. of gp70 antigens from AKR.H-2bSL1, cl.5, and cl.18-12 cells. Expression of the five gp70 antigenic determinants mentioned above was completely restored by exposure of cl.18-5 and cl.18-12 cells to the halogenated pyrimidine, iododeoxyuridine (IudR). Treatment of cl.18-5 and cl.18-12 cells with IudR simultaneously restored CTL susceptibility of these cells to anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL without affecting gag and H-2 antigen expression. Viral gp70 antigen immunoprecipitated from IudR-treated cl.18-5 cells had a mobility slightly lower, but different from that of untreated cl.18-5 cells. Pulse-labeling with [35S]-methionine showed that IudR treatment of cl.18-5 cells caused the expression of an additional high m.w. gp70 precursor protein originally absent in untreated cl.18-5 cells but present on parental AKR.H-2bSL1 cells.

The apparent half-life of the receptor is decreased by greater than 50% as a result of OKT9 treatment. The transferrin receptor is also rapidly redistributed in response to OKT9 such that a lower percentage of the cellular receptors are displayed on the cell surface. OKT9 treatment also leads to a decrease in the total number of receptors participating in the transferrin cycle for cellular iron uptake. The reduction in iron uptake that results from the loss of receptors from the cycle leads to enhanced biosynthesis of the receptor. Receptors with bound OKT9 continue to participate in multiple cycles of iron uptake. However, OKT9 treatment appears to result in a relatively small increase per cycle in the departure of receptors from participation in iron uptake to a pathway leading to receptor degradation. Radiolabeled OKT9 is itself degraded by K562 cells and this degradation is inhibitable by leupeptin or chloroquine. In the presence of leupeptin, OKT9 treatment results in the enhanced intracellular accumulation of transferrin. Because the time involved in the transferrin cycle is shorter (12.5 min) than the normal half-life of the receptor (8 h), a small change in recycling efficiency caused by OKT9 treatment could account for the marked decrease in receptor half-life. In this paper the implications of these findings are discussed as they relate to systems in which receptor number is regulated by ligand.","['Weissman, A M', 'Klausner, R D', 'Rao, K', 'Harford, J B']","['Weissman AM', 'Klausner RD', 'Rao K', 'Harford JB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J97339NR3V (leupeptin)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.102.3.951 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1986 Mar;102(3):951-8. doi: 10.1083/jcb.102.3.951.,,,,PMC2114135,,,,,,,

Equilibrium binding studies revealed that on all cell types examined, GM-CSF bound to a single class of high affinity receptor (1000-5000 receptors/cell) with a Ka of 10(8)-10(9) M-1. More extensive characterization with P388D1 cells showed that binding of GM-CSF was rapid at 37 degrees C with a slow subsequent dissociation rate. Among a panel of lymphokines and growth hormones, only unlabeled natural or recombinant GM-CSF were able to compete for the binding of 125I-GM-CSF to these cells. Affinity cross-linking experiments with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagents disuccinimidyl suberate, disuccinimidyl tartrate, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) resulted in the identification of a receptor protein with a Mr of 130,000 on five out of the seven cell types examined.

Effect of trifluoperazine on recycling in human erythroleukemic cells.,3681-6,"When human erythroleukemic (K562) cells were incubated with 25 microM trifluoperazine (TFP), a drug that inhibits both calmodulin-dependent and calcium-activated phospholipid-dependent kinases, the number of transferrin receptors detected on the cell surface was reduced to approximately half with no change in the affinity of the remaining surface receptors. Removal of the TFP from the incubation medium reversed the loss of surface receptors and they returned to the cell surface in an apparently synchronous manner. As a result, the number of receptors detected on the cell surface exceeded the original level but later returned to normal. Measurements of the total number of receptors available to transferrin in TFP-treated cells suggested that the lost receptors were not participating in the internalization and recycling pathway but instead were probably trapped at an intracellular location. However, those receptors that remained on the cell surface continued to internalize transferrin and to recycle apotransferrin to the cell surface albeit more slowly than in cells that had not been treated with TFP. Using transferrin that had been labeled with iron-59, it was found that although iron uptake was reduced in line with the diminished number of surface receptors, iron still accumulated within TFP-treated cells, suggesting that in the presence of the drug, transferrin-transferrin receptor complexes continued to migrate through an intracellular compartment that contained a low pH.","['Hunt, R C', 'Marshall-Carlson, L']","['Hunt RC', 'Marshall-Carlson L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Temperature', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Trifluoperazine/*pharmacology']",1986/03/15 00:00,1986/03/15 00:01,['1986/03/15 00:00'],"['1986/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)35701-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Mar 15;261(8):3681-6.,['5 S07 RR05386/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Group I cells react only with MAbs J5 and 38.13, recognising the common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen and a BL-associated antigen respectively; group II cells react with J5 and 38.13 and with one or more of a set of MAbs (Ki-24, MHM6, AC2, Ki-1) against ""lymphoblastoid"" antigens; group III cells react only with these anti-""lymphoblastoid"" MAbs. Tumour biopsy cells from 17 cases of sporadic BL, 9 positive for the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus genome and 8 negative, have been analysed during the process of cell line establishment in vitro. In early passage the EB virus-negative BL cells showed either a group I phenotype or gave an additional reactivity with MAb Ki-24 which placed them in group II; these phenotypes remained essentially stable with continued growth of the cell lines for up to 50 passages. By contrast the EB virus-positive BL cells were much more susceptible to phenotypic change in vitro. Although such cells displayed a group I or group II phenotype in early passage, many of the lines soon moved into group III whilst retaining the karyotypic markers indicative of their malignant origin. These observations suggest that a resident EB virus genome can drive the in vitro progression of BL cells towards a more ""lymphoblastoid"" phenotype. This was confirmed in subsequent experiments where virus-negative BL cell lines were converted to EB virus positivity by in vitro infection. Clearly, therefore, phenotypic analysis of long-established lines can lead to false distinctions being drawn between the EB virus-positive and -negative forms of sporadic BL; both may derive from the same sub-population of target B cells in vivo.","['Rowe, M', 'Rooney, C M', 'Edwards, C F', 'Lenoir, G M', 'Rickinson, A B']","['Rowe M', 'Rooney CM', 'Edwards CF', 'Lenoir GM', 'Rickinson AB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/*microbiology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Complement 3d', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis']",1986/03/15 00:00,1986/03/15 00:01,['1986/03/15 00:00'],"['1986/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910370307 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Mar 15;37(3):367-73. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910370307.,,,,,,,,,,,

T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and common alloantigen (CALLA)-positive cells (cells with receptors for CALLA) were sequentially enumerated using commercially available appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Nonadherent cells from weeks 2-5 of culture contained relatively fixed proportions of OKT3-positive (4%-10.4%) and CALLA-positive (5%-6.6%) cells. The adherent cells during the culture period between weeks 6 and 18 contained an average of 34% OKT3-positive cells with a range from 6% to 68.5%, despite a high hydrocortisone concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M added to the growth medium. The T cells retrieved from the adherent layers and resuspended in steroid-free medium responded to PHA stimulation and to mixed leukocyte culture in the same manner as did freshly drawn peripheral blood leukocytes. These results indicate that adherent cell populations include mature T-lymphocytes in human long-term bone marrow cultures. In view of well-documented interactions of nonlymphoid hematopoietic progenitors with T-lymphocytes in the clonogenic culture system, it can be speculated that the adherent T cells also may play a role in proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte-macrophage and erythroid progenitors in this long-term culture system.","['Shibata, T', 'Inoue, S']","['Shibata T', 'Inoue S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphoma', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Mar;14(3):234-40.,,,,,,,,,,,

It appears that the two leukemias express truncated EGF receptors of slightly different sizes with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Hence, acute and chronic retroviruses utilize a common pathway for transformation.

Previously, we have shown that in Abelson-transformed cells, the Abelson kinase regulates the phosphoserine content of ribosomal protein S6. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C, induces the phosphorylation of S6 at the same five phosphopeptides as found in S6 isolated from Abelson-transformed cells. We have investigated three models whereby the Abelson kinase might regulate S6 phosphorylation via the activation of protein kinase C. First, the Abelson kinase could phosphorylate protein kinase C on tyrosine. However, we do not detect significant amounts of phosphotyrosine in protein kinase C in vivo. Second, it has been suggested that protein-tyrosine kinases might phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol. This could increase the intracellular levels of diacylglycerol and thereby activate protein kinase C. Our data strongly suggest that direct phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol by the Abelson protein-tyrosine kinase has no physiological role. Third, an indirect activation of protein kinase C may occur via an increase in the rate of phosphoinositide breakdown. We have found that phosphoinositide breakdown appears to be constitutively activated in Abelson-transformed cells. The implications of these observations are discussed with regard to S6 phosphorylation and the mechanism of Abelson-induced transformation.","['Fry, M J', 'Gebhardt, A', 'Parker, P J', 'Foulkes, J G']","['Fry MJ', 'Gebhardt A', 'Parker PJ', 'Foulkes JG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1985 Dec 1;4(12):3173-8.,,,,PMC554638,,,,,,,

This novel technique potentially has wide applicability to cell circulation time studies as flow cytometry equipment becomes more readily available. Problems with the technique are discussed.

They are relatively rare cells, comprising between 0.03 and 0.06% of all nucleated marrow cells (R. L. Berkow et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., 103: 811-818, 1984). The study of human megakaryocyte differentiation and function has been hampered by the small number of these cells available for study. Recently we have established a human cell line (EST-IU) from the marrow of a patient with an acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and a mediastinal germ cell tumor. While this cell line seems to express many of the phenotypic characteristics of human megakaryocytes, it does not appear to express any phenotypic properties associated with cells of the erythroid, lymphoid, granulocytic, or monocytic lineages. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates frequent multinucleated cells. Staining for platelet peroxidase reactivity revealed darkening of the perinuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum, a characteristic of cells of the megakaryocytic lineage. Indirect immunofluorescence assays reveal that EST-IU expresses reactivity with anti-platelet glycoprotein antisera, anti-Factor VIII-related antigen antisera, anti-Factor V antisera, anti-thrombocyte antisera, Tab (monoclonal anti-platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa), and anti-fibronectin antisera.

Based upon morphological and histochemical characteristics, antigenic expression, and nuclear characteristics, EST-IU cells appear to have a phenotype that closely resembles human megakaryocytes. This cell line should be useful in the further cell study of the molecular and cell biology of human megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Sledge, G W Jr', 'Glant, M', 'Jansen, J', 'Heerema, N A', 'Roth, B J', 'Goheen, M', 'Hoffman, R']","['Sledge GW Jr', 'Glant M', 'Jansen J', 'Heerema NA', 'Roth BJ', 'Goheen M', 'Hoffman R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoenzymes)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/immunology/*pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*pathology']",1986/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 2):2155-9.,"['CA 34841-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 31710-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In most cases, such inhibition is not accompanied by cell loss, with the exception of multiple cell lines of human small cell lung carcinoma (SCC), a human leukemia cell line (HL-60), and possibly the B16 melanoma cell line. The first two cell types grow as anchorage-independent suspension cultures, the HL-60 as single cells and the SCC as multicellular spheroid aggregates. Moreover, in the spectrum of human lung carcinoma cells in culture, the SCC cells respond in a cytotoxic manner to DFMO, whereas the non-small cell lung carcinoma (non-SCC) cells, which are anchorage dependent, show only growth inhibition, without actual cell loss. In the present study, we have investigated relationships between anchorage-dependent and -independent growth patterns of cells in culture and their response to DFMO treatment. Two non-SCC lung cancer cell lines, which normally grow as anchorage-dependent monolayers, show growth inhibition but no cell loss with the addition of DFMO. When these anchorage-dependent cells were forced to grow as multicellular aggregates, by coating the culture flask with Teflon, the cells developed an increased sensitivity to DFMO. They showed not only inhibition of cell proliferation but also cell death. Two SCC cell lines, which normally grow as anchorage-independent spheroids, developed adherence to the culture dishes coated with fibronectin. These cells, which show a cytotoxic response to DFMO during normal anchorage-independent growth, developed a decreased sensitivity to DFMO, showing only cell growth inhibition, but no cell death when treated during anchorage-dependent growth. Our data thus suggest that the state of anchorage dependence of lung cancer cells in culture is a critical factor in determining their response to polyamine depletion during treatment with DFMO.","['Luk, G D', 'Baylin, S B']","['Luk GD', 'Baylin SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Polyamines)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Eflornithine', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polyamines/biosynthesis']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 1):1844-8.,"['CA34453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

To determine its mechanism of growth inhibition, we compared effects of 42/6 and B3/25, an immunoglobulin G anti-transferrin receptor antibody which does not inhibit lymphocyte growth, on transferrin (TF) binding and uptake. As in previous studies, affinity constants of TF and anti-TF receptor antibodies for human TF receptors at 4 degrees C were similar, but the number of calculated binding sites was higher for the antibodies. Antibody B3/25 did not inhibit TF binding at either 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, antibody 42/6 inhibited TF binding to normal, mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells. However, TF did not inhibit 42/6 binding, suggesting 42/6 inhibited TF binding by noncompetitive, possibly steric, mechanisms. When cells were simultaneously exposed to labeled TF and unlabeled anti-TF receptor antibodies at 37 degrees C, 42/6 inhibited TF binding only slightly. Initial uptake of antibodies and TF at 37 degrees C was rapid, but when mononuclear cells or HL60 cells were cultured with either 42/6 or B3/25 for 2 days, TF binding and immunoreactive TF receptor sites decreased. However, TF bound to cells cultured with B3/25 continued to enter the cell, whereas cells cultured with 42/6 would no longer take up bound TF. Studies using HL60 cells grown with soluble iron in lieu of TF showed that changes in TF binding sites and TF uptake were not secondary to growth inhibition. We conclude that incubation with both inhibitory (42/6) and noninhibitory (B3/25) anti-TF receptor antibodies results in decreased TF binding sites. However, exposure to 42/6 also inhibits TF uptake and causes growth inhibition by iron deprivation. Monoclonal antibodies to receptors transporting critical nutrient molecules, such as iron, may inhibit cell growth by blocking ligand access to the cell's interior.","['Taetle, R', 'Castagnola, J', 'Mendelsohn, J']","['Taetle R', 'Castagnola J', 'Mendelsohn J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Iron/physiology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/*immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 1):1759-63.,"['CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The molecular advances are related to two cellular oncogenes, c-abl and c-sis, and also to the identification and molecular cloning of specific areas of DNA (e.g., band 22q11), permitting the isolation of a probe specific for the translocation breakpoint domain. In the preponderant number of cases examined, it was found that the breakpoints at 22q11 occur within a limited region of up to 5-6 kb, for which the term ""breakpoint cluster region"" (bcr) has been suggested. In contrast, breaks at 9q34 seem to occur within a much larger region at the molecular level. Yet to be established is the exact genetic composition of the bcr and a determination as to whether or not the breaks leading to the disease occur preferentially within specific areas. In spite of this level of knowledge, we do not understand how the Ph chromosome participates in CML. If Ph-positive CML is ultimately associated with a cascade of gene activations, the unraveling of their nature and chronology will undoubtedly tell us much of their contribution to the biology of CML, in particular, and to neoplasia, in general. In this respect, the rather clear description of CML in cytogenetic, clinical, and laboratory terms, the relatively long chronic phase of the disease, and the association of the blastic phase with nonrandom chromosome changes (at least in the initial phases of the disease) make Ph-positive CML an excellent candidate for a model for the study of molecular events in human neoplasia.","['Sandberg, A A', 'Gemmill, R M', 'Hecht, B K', 'Hecht, F']","['Sandberg AA', 'Gemmill RM', 'Hecht BK', 'Hecht F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1986/03/15 00:00,1986/03/15 00:01,['1986/03/15 00:00'],"['1986/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(86)90039-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(86)90039-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1986 Mar 15;21(2):129-46. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(86)90039-7.,"['CA-14555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",92,,,,,,,,,

Similar concentrations also inhibited the formation of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by LTC synthetase, a detergent-solubilized cell free particulate enzyme from RBL cells which is capable of coupling LTA4 to glutathione. By contrast, the conversion of LTA4 to LTC4 using enzymes from rat liver was at least ten times less sensitive to this inhibitor. The EC50 for inhibition of the leukotriene C synthetase of RBL cells was directly proportional to the LTA4 concentration in the incubations, ranging from 1.5 mM at 10 microM LTA4 to over 40 mM at 500 microM LTA4. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition of the leukotriene C synthetase reaction by diethylcarbamazine was competitive with respect to LTA4. In contrast to diethylcarbamazine, piriprost (U-60,257; 6,9-deepoxy-6,9-(phenylimino)-delta 6,8-prostaglandin I1), which inhibits the formation of sulfidopeptide leuktrienes in RBL cells at the 5-lipoxygenase step (EC50 5 microM), did not inhibit the leukotriene synthetase of these cells. On the other hand, low concentrations of piriprost, which had no demonstrable inhibitory activity on leukotriene formation by themselves, markedly synergized the inhibitory activity of diethylcarbamazine. These results are consistent with the interpretation that both piriprost and diethylcarbamazine inhibit leukotriene formation but that they act on sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway in such a manner as to synergistically interfere with the availability or utilization of LTA4 in the leukotriene C synthetase reaction.","['Bach, M K', 'Brashler, J R']","['Bach MK', 'Brashler JR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Leukotriene A4)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (SRS-A)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'R802O5NILK (piriprost)', 'V867Q8X3ZD (Diethylcarbamazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Diethylcarbamazine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epoprostenol/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukotriene A4', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'SRS-A/*biosynthesis']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(86)90215-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90215-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Feb 1;35(3):425-33. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90215-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the ability of m-AMSA to produce DNA cleavage in 3 human myeloid leukemic cell lines with different sensitivities to the cytotoxic actions of m-AMSA to see if the magnitude of DNA cleavage correlated with the degree of m-AMSA sensitivity. DNA alkaline elution was used to quantify DNA cleavage. The amount of m-AMSA-induced DNA cleavage in the two lines sensitive to m-AMSA was 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than that in an m-AMSA-resistant leukemic line. The m-AMSA resistant line had been developed by prolonged exposure of one of the sensitive lines to m-AMSA. This finding was not secondary to a decreased uptake of m-AMSA in the resistant cell line. m-AMSA treatment of the nuclei isolated from the three lines produced DNA cleavage frequencies comparable to the cleavage frequencies produced by m-AMSA treatment of the whole cells from which the nuclei were isolated. The DNA cleaving ability stimulated by m-AMSA is thought to be mediated by drug-induced effects on topoisomerase II, a nuclear enzyme that mediates alterations in DNA conformation. Alterations in the manner in which this enzyme interacts with antineoplastic agents may explain the emergence of resistant cells following initially successful chemotherapy.","['Bakic, M', 'Beran, M', 'Andersson, B S', 'Silberman, L', 'Estey, E', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Bakic M', 'Beran M', 'Andersson BS', 'Silberman L', 'Estey E', 'Zwelling LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology']",1986/01/29 00:00,1986/01/29 00:01,['1986/01/29 00:00'],"['1986/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(86)80467-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80467-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1986 Jan 29;134(2):638-45. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80467-3.,['CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

They include calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (C-kinase) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMPd PK). Changes in protein kinase activation were correlated with the immunosuppression of polyamine and DNA synthesis measured by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) induction and 3H-thymidine incorporation, respectively. These studies utilized murine T cell tumor lines sensitive to the effects of CsA. Similar to the mitogen activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, CsA was capable of inhibiting the induction of ODC and 3H-thymidine uptake of T cell tumor lines cultured with either fresh serum or mitogen. In contrast, C-kinase and cAMPd PK activation stimulated by the addition of fresh serum was not affected by CsA. Further, CsA did not inhibit the direct activation of C-kinase with phorbol esters or the activation of cAMPd PK with exogenous cAMP. We conclude that CsA does not affect the activation of either C-kinase or cAMPd PK in T cell tumor lines when activated by either fresh serum or when stimulated with chemical agents.

Only 0,1-10% of carriers develop lymphoid tumours, which also consist of B-lymphocytes. In contrast to PL, however, they are of mono- or oligoclonal origin in terms of the integration site, which is characteristic for each tumour. All cells contain one or more copies of the viral genome, chromosomal aberrations are common and if deletions are present they are invariably found in the 5'-half of the virus DNA sequence. In both types of affected cells transcription is repressed in vivo, but transient virus production can be induced in vitro and detected by means of syncytia induction or haemagglutination. In vivo production of virus in some unknown cell is suggested by the presence of high antibody titres in infected animals, especially against the envelope glycoprotein gp51. This can be detected by various techniques such as immunodiffusion, radioimmune assay or ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies against gp51 have revealed 8 epitopes, 3 of which are recognized by neutralizing antibodies and one by a cytolytic antibody. The BLV genome, about 9 kb in size, have been cloned, and some of the information obtained on its molecular structure and function is discussed. It codes for at least 4 non-glycosylated and 2 glycoproteins. Of special interest is the recently discovered serological relationship between some of the non-glycosylated proteins and those of the human T-cell leukaemia virus. The functional role of BLV in leukaemogenesis is largely unknown. The presence of the viral genome seems to be necessary for the maintenance of the transformed state, but not its continuous expression nor an LTR-mediated promotion of transcription of cellular genes. No oncogene is carried by the virus. Although bovine leukosis is not of major economic importance, its eradication is desirable and feasible in countries with a relatively low incidence, by means of testing and elimination. For endemic situations vaccination would be preferable, and distinct possibilities exist for the development of gp51 based vaccines.","['Burny, A', 'Bruck, C', 'Cleuter, Y', 'Couez, D', 'Deschamps, J', 'Gregoire, D', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Kettmann, R', 'Mammerickx, M', 'Marbaix, G']","['Burny A', 'Bruck C', 'Cleuter Y', 'Couez D', 'Deschamps J', 'Gregoire D', 'Ghysdael J', 'Kettmann R', 'Mammerickx M', 'Marbaix G', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",South Africa,Onderstepoort J Vet Res,The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research,0401107,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/*microbiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Genes, Viral', 'Goats', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/microbiology/prevention & control/transmission/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/analysis/genetics/immunology', '*Retroviridae/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis', 'Sheep']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Onderstepoort J Vet Res. 1985 Sep;52(3):133-44.,,124,,,,,,,,,

To identify sites in the encoded membrane glycoprotein that are important for its pathogenic function, we molecularly cloned and partially sequenced the env genes of two mutant viruses (clone 63 and clone 4) and one revertant (clone 4REV). Clone 63 contained three noncontiguous point mutations that caused nonconservative amino acid substitutions of Gly-119----Arg-119, Cys-180----Tyr-180, and Gly-203----Arg-203 in the xenotropic-related domain of the env glycoprotein. These substitutions were presumably responsible for the altered electrophoretic and pathogenic properties of the mutant glycoprotein. The presence of these and several other G-A nucleotide substitutions at different sites in one spontaneous mutant provided striking evidence that error-rich proviruses can form during retroviral replication. Clone 4 contained a point mutation that generated a premature termination condon at amino acid residue 304 (Gln-304----Ochre-304). This termination codon was located immediately after the proposed xenotropic-ecotropic recombination site and eliminated the ecotropic-related domain, including the putative membrane anchor of the glycoprotein. Clone 4REV was a true revertant derived from clone 4 in which the premature termination codon had back-mutated to re-form the wild-type sequence.

This suggests that the chromosomal abnormality, and possibly infection by HTLV-I, occurred before TCR beta gene rearrangement. Cell lines infected by HTLV-I express levels of TCR beta mRNA similar to PHA stimulated lymphocytes, suggesting that this gene is not transcriptionally activated as a result of infection by HTLV-I. Cloned T cells of known antigen specificity that are infected by HTLV-I in vitro show impairment of immune function, including loss of antigen-specific responsiveness and the acquisition of alloreactivity. Comparison of the configuration of the TCR beta gene before and after infection revealed no changes detectable by Southern blot analysis. Levels of expression of the TCR beta gene at the mRNA level and surface expression of the T3 complex were also not significantly altered, suggesting that changes in immune function cannot be attributed to quantitative changes in the TCR molecule. The configuration of the TCR beta gene in primary tumor cells infected by HTLV-I was compared with that in the derived cell lines. In all pairs examined, the configuration in the primary tumor cells was different from that in the cell lines, strongly suggesting that the cells that grow in culture are not the original neoplastic cells.","['Jarrett, R F', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Mann, D L', 'Cossman, J', 'Broder, S', 'Reitz, M S']","['Jarrett RF', 'Mitsuya H', 'Mann DL', 'Cossman J', 'Broder S', 'Reitz MS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.163.2.383 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 Feb 1;163(2):383-99. doi: 10.1084/jem.163.2.383.,,,,PMC2188022,,,,,,,

Cyclic nucleotide metabolism was studied during monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cell line. In synchronous and nonsynchronous cell cultures, cyclic AMP levels were raised 300-fold or 25-fold in response to N6, O2-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate or the combination of prostaglandin E2 and theophylline, respectively. No reproducible changes in intracellular adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate levels occurred in response to retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide, suggesting that changes in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate levels alone do not mediate cell maturation induced by these compounds.

Rosette formation occurred at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C, and was inhibited by soluble transferrin in a dose-dependent manner. Human lactoferrin, which is known to have considerable amino acid sequence homology with transferrin, did not inhibit rosette formation with transferrin-coated bovine erythrocytes. A variety of blocking and non-blocking monoclonal antibodies against the human transferrin receptor (42/6, B3/25 and OKT9) inhibited rosette formation. Rosettes are able to withstand low-speed centrifugation (130 X g, 2 min) making this method potentially useful for cytochemical identification of receptor-positive or receptor-negative cells.

Two cell lines, MT-2 and C10/MJ2, were found to produce high levels of MAF activity constitutively, but the MT-2 cell line, unlike C10/MJ2, produced little IFN-gamma. This observation was confirmed by Northern blot analysis performed with specific IFN-gamma cDNA probe. The MT-2 cell line thus provides a useful system to evaluate the existence of lymphokines with MAF activity that are distinct from IFN-gamma. The MAF activity produced by MT-2 cells was distinguished from IFN-gamma by the following criteria. MAF activity was not removed by immunoaffinity chromatography with the use of immobilized specific polyclonal antibodies to IFN-gamma and was not neutralized by a monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma. Heat or acid treatments of IFN-gamma resulted in loss of its antiviral activity, but these treatments had no effect on MAF activity. MAF activity was not abolished by polymyxin B sulfate, suggesting that this activity is not mediated by or dependent on LPS. Initial characterization studies performed by using membrane filtration, gel filtration chromatography, and isoelectric focusing indicate that the non-IFN-gamma MAF activity produced by MT-2 cells has an apparent m.w. of 55,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.5. Collectively, these data suggest that the MT-2 human T cell line constitutively produces high levels of MAF and low levels of IFN-gamma and offers a useful source for the further purification of a unique human lymphokine with macrophage-activating activity that is distinct from IFN-gamma.","['Lee, J C', 'Rebar, L', 'Young, P', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Hanna, N', 'Poste, G']","['Lee JC', 'Rebar L', 'Young P', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Hanna N', 'Poste G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-Activating Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cell-Free System', 'Culture Media/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophage-Activating Factors', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1986/02/15 00:00,1986/02/15 00:01,['1986/02/15 00:00'],"['1986/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Feb 15;136(4):1322-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

Application of these reagents to the investigation of neoplastic T cells has resulted in the determination of the subset of origin and the stage of differentiation of the neoplastic cells in T-cell-derived lymphoproliferative malignancies. Recent advances in molecular biology have made possible the Southern blot hybridization analysis of DNA extracted from neoplastic T cells for patterns of T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Examination of these patterns in benign and malignant T and non-T cell has provided the basis for the use of T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements as specific genetic markers of T-cell lineage, clonality, and differentiation. These and other advances have resulted in the delineation of a new category of T-cell neoplasia, the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome. They have also demonstrated that the majority of clinically indolent neoplasms composed of large granular lymphocytes in so-called T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease are monoclonal proliferations.

There are two major sites of DNA length variation: one in the intergenic region with three alleles and one in the first intron of the zeta 1 gene with at least four alleles. Our mapping establishes that the intronic polymorphism is associated with a tandem array of short, repeated sequences. The length alleles occur in each of four human populations sampled, suggesting an ancient origin with persistence of several length alleles, or rapid regeneration of these particular variants. Four polymorphic restriction sites were also found; the frequency of polymorphic sites is comparable to that found in the human beta-globin gene region.

High affinity binding (Kd) constant was not altered, and the change in binding was attributed to receptor number. Commitment to increased insulin receptor expression was demonstrated after 1-h exposure to 1 microM 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Agents which induced granulocytic differentiation, such as 160 mM dimethyl sulfoxide and 100 nM retinoic acid, significantly decreased insulin receptor expression compared to monocytic inducing agents.

Relationship to stage and disease course.,1230-4,"Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was measured in 61 children at diagnosis with all stages of neuroblastoma. The median serum values for Stages I, II, III, IV, and IV-S were 13, 23, 40, 214, and 40 ng/ml, respectively. Mean serum levels were different between groups I versus IV, (P = 0.0004) II versus IV (P = 0.0001) and IV-S versus IV (P = 0.004). The prognostic value of serum NSE for disease-free survival was determined in 54 patients at risk for relapse 2 or more years after diagnosis. The disease-free survival rate of all patients with levels of less than 100 ng/ml was 27/34 (79%), whereas it was 2/20 (10%) for those with higher levels. In 28 patients with lower stage disease and a good prognosis (Stages I, II, and IV-S) NSE levels were not predictive of relapse. Only 1 of these 28 patients had a raised level (greater than 100 ng/ml) and survived without relapse, whereas 4 patients who relapsed had serum NSE less than 100 ng/ml at diagnosis. In patients with Stages III and IV disease, a raised serum NSE level was associated with poor outcome: only 1/19 (5%) survived with NSE levels greater than 100 ng/ml, whereas survival was 5/8 (63%) with values below 100 ng/ml. Serial samples were analyzed on 17 patients; all 8 patients with initial NSE levels greater than 100 ng/ml achieved near normal levels during remission (median, 21 ng/ml). However, in only 4/10 patients studied at time of relapse, did the levels rise coincident with relapse. The sera of 47 patients with other forms of cancer and 19 siblings of cancer patients were at or near the normal limits (0-15 ng/ml), with three exceptions: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (286 ng/ml), hepatoblastoma (176 ng/ml), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (105 ng/ml). Serum NSE is a useful marker for patients with advanced neuroblastoma in whom elevated levels were associated with a poor outcome; the raised NSE levels returned to near normal after therapy. In patients with Stage IV-S disease serum NSE levels were significantly lower than those in Stage IV despite their extensive tumor burden. Serum NSE estimation may confirm Stage IV-S status and suggest a more benign clinical course.","['Zeltzer, P M', 'Marangos, P J', 'Evans, A E', 'Schneider, S L']","['Zeltzer PM', 'Marangos PJ', 'Evans AE', 'Schneider SL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)'],IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/enzymology', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Medulloblastoma/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroblastoma/*enzymology/pathology/therapy', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/*blood/urine', 'Prognosis', 'Retinoblastoma/enzymology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Wilms Tumor/enzymology']",1986/03/15 00:00,1986/03/15 00:01,['1986/03/15 00:00'],"['1986/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19860315)57:6<1230::aid-cncr2820570628>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Mar 15;57(6):1230-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860315)57:6<1230::aid-cncr2820570628>3.0.co;2-#.,"['CA-14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05654/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Two intercalators--4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA, amsacrine) and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium (2-Me-9-OH-E+)--differ in their effects on protein-associated double-strand breaks in isolated nuclei. m-AMSA stimulates their production at all concentrations, whereas 2-Me-9-OH-E+ stimulates at low concentrations and inhibits at high concentrations. We have reproduced these differential effects in experiments carried out in vitro with purified L1210 DNA topoisomerase II, and we have found that concentrations of 2-Me-9-OH-E+ above 5 microM prevent the trapping of DNA-topoisomerase II cleavable complexes irrespective of the presence of m-AMSA. It also stimulated topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand passage, again with or without inhibitory amounts of m-AMSA (this result suggests that extensive intercalation by 2-Me-9-OH-E+ destabilized the cleavable complexes). From these data, it is concluded that intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA strand breaks observed in intact eukaryotic cells and isolated nuclei are generated by DNA topoisomerase II and that intercalators can affect mammalian DNA topoisomerase II in more than one way. They can trap cleavable complexes and inhibit DNA topoisomerase II mediated DNA relaxation (m-AMSA and low concentrations of 2-Me-9-OH-E+) or destabilize cleavable complexes and stimulate DNA relaxation (high concentrations of 2-Me-9-OH-E+).","['Pommier, Y', 'Minford, J K', 'Schwartz, R E', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Kohn, K W']","['Pommier Y', 'Minford JK', 'Schwartz RE', 'Zwelling LA', 'Kohn KW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '1F1959S062 (elliptinium)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding']",1985/11/05 00:00,1985/11/05 00:01,['1985/11/05 00:00'],"['1985/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00344a015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1985 Nov 5;24(23):6410-6. doi: 10.1021/bi00344a015.,,,,,,,,,,,

Isolated L1210 cell nuclei were used to determine the saturability of this reaction at high drug concentrations. 4'-(9-Acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) and 5-iminodaunorubicin (5-ID) both produced DSB in a concentration-dependent manner, and the production of these breaks leveled off above 10 microM. Addition of m-AMSA to 5-ID-treated nuclei did not raise the plateau level. Thus, both drugs seemed to interact similarly on identical targets. The ellipticine derivative 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium (2-Me-9-OH-E+) had two effects on the production of DSB. Below 10 microM, 2-Me-9-OH-E+ produced DSB as did ellipticine, m-AMSA, or 5-ID. Above 10 microM, 2-Me-9-OH-E+ did not induce DSB and inhibited the DSB induced by m-AMSA, 5-ID, or ellipticine. 2-Me-9-OH-E+ and m-AMSA competed with each other to produce either double-strand break formation (m-AMSA-induced reaction) or double-strand break inhibition (2-Me-9-OH-E+-induced reaction at concentrations greater than 10 microM). Because these results were reproduced in experiments using DNA topoisomerase II isolated from L1210 nuclei, it is likely that the intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA breaks detected by alkaline elution in nuclei represent DNA topoisomerase II-DNA complexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Pommier, Y', 'Schwartz, R E', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Kohn, K W']","['Pommier Y', 'Schwartz RE', 'Zwelling LA', 'Kohn KW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice']",1985/11/05 00:00,1985/11/05 00:01,['1985/11/05 00:00'],"['1985/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00344a014 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1985 Nov 5;24(23):6406-10. doi: 10.1021/bi00344a014.,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-dependent increases in CSF release by adherent blood and marrow cells occurred in serum-free media and the continuous presence of Tf was necessary for this effect. Using a monoclonal anti-Tf receptor antibody, normal blood mononuclear cells contained no detectable Tf receptor positive cells. However, after 5 d culture in serum-free medium, Tf receptor positive cells were identified among normal adherent blood cells, and the per cent receptor positive cells increased with Tf concentration.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was released rapidly, with no measurable latency on hormone stimulation, and, consistent with its proposed role as an intracellular messenger for Ca2+ mobilization, there was good temporal correlation between its formation and Ca2+-mediated events in these tissues. There was a definite latency before an increase in the formation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate could be detected. In all of these tissues, however, it formed a substantial proportion of the total inositol trisphosphate by 1 min of stimulation. In guinea-pig hepatocytes, where inositol trisphosphate increases for at least 30 min after hormone application, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate made up about 90% of the total inositol trisphosphate by 5-10 min. In pancreatic acinar cells, pretreatment with 20 mM-Li+ caused an increase in hormone-induced inositol trisphosphate accumulation. This increase was accounted for by a rise in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was unaffected.

The properties of these cells was found to be independent of the helper virus used, suggesting that it is the SFFVp genome, not the helper virus, that plays a determinant role in the late stages of erythroleukemia.","['Mager, D L', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mager DL', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/physiology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(85)90269-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1985 Mar;141(2):337-41. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(85)90269-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the role of x-lor and other HTLV-I genes in cellular transformation, we obtained a transformed nonproducer human T-cell line containing a single defective HTLV-I provirus (HTLV-I 55/PL). This 7-kilobase provirus had undergone a deletion involving the entire envelope gene and the nonconserved region. The point of the deletion corresponded to the junction of a donor splice site, located between the polymerase gene and the envelope gene (nucleotide 5183), and the acceptor site for the mRNA of the x-lor gene (nucleotide 7302). The juxtaposition of nucleotides 5182 and 7302 brings the initiating methionine codon of the envelope gene immediately 5' to the x-lor region, leaving the DNA sequence in frame for expression of a protein product. This finding suggests that a double splicing mechanism is used to express the x-lor gene, and that the defective provirus 55/PL was generated through the reverse transcription of a partially spliced mRNA. Analysis of the x-lor mRNA of other HTLV-I-transformed cell lines revealed that a double splicing process is commonly used. Furthermore, since 55/PL can be faithfully transmitted and is able to immortalize recipient T cells, we can conclude that the envelope gene is not necessary for in vitro transformation by HTLV-I.","['Aldovini, A', 'De Rossi, A', 'Feinberg, M B', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Franchini, G']","['Aldovini A', 'De Rossi A', 'Feinberg MB', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Franchini G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.1.38 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jan;83(1):38-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.1.38.,,,,PMC322786,,,,,,,

The first type of cell (e.g., R8) is an ""immature pre-B cell,"" and it contains at least one intermediate recombinant structure containing heavy-chain diversity (DH) and JH sequences but no variable region (VH) sequence. This type of cell, which has also been characterized by other investigators, generates mu-positive sublines during subsequent culturing of cells and represents a precursor stage to pre-B cells. The second type of cell (e.g., RAW253) is an ""abortive pre-B cell,"" in that both JH alleles contain nonfunctional VH-DH-JH structures. The nucleotide sequence determinations in this study demonstrated that these nonfunctional V-D-J structures were generated by nonproductive somatic recombinations, involving either out-of-phase joining events, or the formation of termination codons in the DH coding sequences. The identification of abortive pre-B cells suggests that the recombinational joining of Ig VH, DH, and JH segments is not actively regulated by a putative recombinase to preserve the translational reading frame. This in turn implies that a large portion of precursor cells at the early stage of B-cell differentiation are abortive and possibly blocked to further differentiation.","['Hagiya, M', 'Davis, D D', 'Takahashi, T', 'Okuda, K', 'Raschke, W C', 'Sakano, H']","['Hagiya M', 'Davis DD', 'Takahashi T', 'Okuda K', 'Raschke WC', 'Sakano H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['*Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.1.145 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jan;83(1):145-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.1.145.,"['AI-18790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37344/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC322808,"['GENBANK/M12568', 'GENBANK/M12569', 'GENBANK/M12570', 'GENBANK/M14560', 'GENBANK/M14561', 'GENBANK/M14562']",,,,,,

Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or lymphoadenopathy virus (LAV) and type I (HTLV-I) are etiologically linked to AIDS and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, respectively. T-cell growth factor (TCGF, also known as interleukin 2) is required for the growth of activated T-cells, which play an important role in immune regulation. gamma-Interferon (IFN-gamma) is also implicated in immune modulation. It was possible that T-cell depletion in acquired immune deficiency syndrome could be due to an impairment of TCGF synthesis and that adult T-cell leukemia could be due to unregulated production of TCGF. The results reported here show that the transcription of the TCGF gene was not impaired in cultured HTLV-III-infected cells. Paradoxically, the TCGF gene in HTLV-I-infected cells was transcriptionally inactive. The reverse was the case for the gamma-interferon gene--it was actively transcribed in HTLV-I-infected cells but not in the HTLV-III-infected and virus-producing H9 and H4 cell line. No evidence was obtained suggesting abnormal regulation of the TCGF or of the IFN-gamma gene consequent to HTLV-III infection. It thus appears that in both HTLV-III and HTLV-I infection, growth control and immune regulatory mechanisms may bypass a modulatory role of TCGF or of IFN-gamma.","['Arya, S K', 'Gallo, R C']","['Arya SK', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*physiopathology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Deltaretrovirus', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.24.8691 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Dec;82(24):8691-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.24.8691.,,,,PMC391502,,,,,,,

Strains of FeLV have been recognized which specifically induce lymphosarcoma, aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic anaemia, and, recently, feline AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), a naturally occurring immunosuppressive syndrome strikingly similar to human AIDS which is lethal in 100% of inoculated and viraemic specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats. Here, we have analysed FeLV DNA in tissues of 22 SPF cats that had been inoculated with the feline AIDS strain (FeLV-FAIDS) and we find two classes of viral DNA--a monotypic common form which is detectable in bone marrow regardless of disease state, and variant forms, recognizable by restriction site differences, whose appearance correlates with onset of disease symptoms and persists throughout the course of the disease. FeLV-FAIDS variant DNA is detected at high concentration (10-50 copies per cell) and principally as unintegrated viral DNA (UVD) in bone marrow of cats with feline AIDS. In marked contrast high levels of UVD were not present in cats in the terminal-stages of T-cell lymphosarcoma, aplastic anaemia, or myelodysplastic anaemia induced by other FeLV strains. These results parallel recent observations in humans, where high levels of UVD were sometimes found in cells derived from AIDS patients infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III)/lymph-adenopathy-associated virus (LAV), and suggest that persistence of unintegrated variant viral DNA is a crucial indicator of retrovirus-induced cytopathic disease syndromes such as AIDS.","['Mullins, J I', 'Chen, C S', 'Hoover, E A']","['Mullins JI', 'Chen CS', 'Hoover EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*genetics', 'Cats', 'Chickens', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology']",1986/01/23 00:00,1986/01/23 00:01,['1986/01/23 00:00'],"['1986/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/319333a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1986 Jan 23-29;319(6051):333-6. doi: 10.1038/319333a0.,"['CA32552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34975/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients were treated in each group. Cutaneous dissemination of infection occurred in none of the 10 acyclovir recipients and in 5 of the 10 vidarabine recipients who had presented with localized dermatomal disease (P = 0.016). As compared with vidarabine, acyclovir treatment shortened the median periods during which cultures were positive for the virus (four vs. seven days, P = 0.004) and new lesions formed (three vs. six days, P = 0.03). Acyclovir also shortened the median interval until the first decrease in pain (4 vs. 7 days, P = 0.005), the pustulation of all lesions (4 vs. 7 days, P = 0.0004), the crusting of all lesions (7 vs. 17 days, P = 0.0003), and the complete healing of lesions (17 vs. 28 days, P = 0.003).

Following this, L1210 and P388 cells grow and rapidly replace the normal hematopoietic cells of the B.M. L1210 and P388 cells, but not several lymphoma cell lines, also bind avidly to monolayers of B.M. stromal cells (Dexter cultures) and soon overgrow the cultures following rapid cell proliferation. P388 cells bound equally well to confluent monolayers of B.M., whole mouse embryo and newborn mouse kidney while L1210 cells bound well to B.M. and whole mouse embryo but showed little binding to newborn kidney monolayers. The accumulation of the two leukemia cell lines in the B.M. was constant and indistinguishable over a 48-h period. In contrast, in both spleen and liver the number of L1210 cells decreased during the same period while P388 cells were retained at a constant level. Generally there was a lack of correlation of B.M. metastasis of a cell line and its metastasis to other organs although P388 cells, but not L1210 cells, demonstrated a tremendous capacity for metastatic growth in both spleen and liver. Normal B.M. cells were fused with the syngeneic SP2/0 murine myeloma fusor line and 10 hybridomas plus the SP2/0 parent were tested for in-vitro adherence to B.M. monolayers and in-vivo metastatic behavior. The same 3 (out of 10) hybridomas showed a high level of adherence to B.M. monolayers, high levels of retention of cells in the B.M. following i.v. injection, and rapid growth and takeover of the normal B.M. In marked contrast, neither the SP2/0 parent nor the remaining 7 hybridomas show significant adherence, B.M. retention or growth in the B.M. A distinct lack of correlation of B.M. vs liver or spleen metastasis was once again noted for the hybridomas although all of the hybridomas showed much less metastatic growth in the liver than the SP2/0 parent. Seven out of 10 hybridomas also showed less metastatic growth in the spleen including all 3 of the hybridomas which showed preferential growth in the B.M. Our data are consistent with the existence of cell surface 'homing' receptors on leukemia cells for normal B.M. stromal cells which function to retain the leukemia cells in the B.M.

We detected viral sequences in fresh specimens from spleen, thymus, liver, skin and peripheral blood neoplastic lymphocytes. The pattern of HTLV-I integration is identical in the leukemic cells and in all other tissues analysed, but the signal intensity is strongest in the leukemic cells, indicating the source of HTLV-I proviral sequences was the leukemic T-cells which had infiltrated these tissues. In fact, the cultured skin fibroblasts of the patient did not contain HTLV-I sequence. However, cultured lymphocytes of this patient was consistently an immortalized B-cell line containing HTLV-I sequences in a manner indicative of a polyclonal infection. This cell line was also infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In order to determine whether HTLV-I alone was sufficient for B-cell immortalization, we obtained single cell clones by limiting dilution. The DNA of all the cell clones that we analysed contained both the HTLV-I and EBV genomes, suggesting that immortalization of the B-cell was more likely due to the EBV rather than HTLV-I. Infectious HTLV-I viruses produced by the B-cell line still had the propensity to infect and transform T-lymphocytes in normal human umbilical cord blood. Unlike the parental B cells, the transformed T lymphocytes were clonally selected. Our results indicate that although the predominant infected cell population of the patient was his leukemic T lymphocytes, some of his EBV-positive B-lymphocytes were also polyclonally infected. The latter had a growth advantage in culture over the T lymphocytes but the virus produced by these immortalized B cells has not been adapted and has maintained its tropism for T cells.","['Franchini, G', 'Mann, D L', 'Popovic, M', 'Zicht, R R', 'Gallo, R C', 'Wong-Staal, F']","['Franchini G', 'Mann DL', 'Popovic M', 'Zicht RR', 'Gallo RC', 'Wong-Staal F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90116-X [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90116-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(11):1305-14. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90116-x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 2 months after inoculation, IRW and NFS/N mice inoculated as newborns with F-MuLV 57 had gross splenomegaly caused by erythroid proliferation. In contrast, an equivalent dose of F-MuLV B3 induced spleen or lymph node enlargement 4 to 13 months after inoculation. Although most cases of spleen enlargement in F-MuLV B3-inoculated mice were due to erythroid proliferation, lymphoid or myeloid proliferation was also frequently observed. The replication of both F-MuLV 57 and B3 was equally efficient, and both viruses generated recombinant dual-tropic mink cell focus-forming (MCF) viruses with the same kinetics and efficiency. Moreover, MCF viruses induced by F-MuLV 57 and B3 had the same antigenic patterns.

Our serial section study also showed that some type 2 nuclear pockets are open, (i.e. there is continuity between the material in the pocket and the contents of the nucleus) while others are closed (i.e. the material in the pocket is completely separated from the material in the nucleus).

Both symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection (17 of 37 or 46% vs. 8 of 38 or 21%, p = 0.04) and interstitial pneumonia (17 of 37 or 46% vs. 7 of 38 or 18%, p = 0.02) occurred less frequently in the recipients of polyvalent intravenous immune globulin.

All immune globulin preparations were well-tolerated. These preliminary results suggest that intravenous immune globulin can modify the severity of cytomegalovirus infection and prevent interstitial pneumonia in marrow transplants.

With photoaffinity labeling, single-strand breaks were prominent immediately, even when photolabeling of cells was done on ice, but restoration of DNA supercoiling still required 21 h.

Since virus integration in these hybrids occurs at many different sites, these types of hybrids may ultimately be useful for generating virally induced mutations that are amenable to study at the molecular level.","['Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Inbreeding', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Male', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics/*microbiology', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/microbiology/transmission', 'Viremia/*genetics/microbiology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(85)90254-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(85)90254-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1985 Dec;43(3 Pt 2):811-9. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(85)90254-5.,"['CA-37283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

A phorbol ester-resistant variant R1B6 obtained by culturing HL-60 cells with increasing concentrations of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, is reversibly resistant. These cells have been growing continuously in the presence of phorbol esters for more than 1 yr, but when the phorbol ester is removed, the cells gradually regain their sensitivity and express characteristics of macrophage-like cells upon readdition of phorbol ester. The concentration of phorbol ester receptors in R1B6 is about one-third that in the parental HL-60 cells. The reversion of the variants to sensitivity to phorbol esters is associated with the up regulation of the cytosol and membrane phorbol ester receptors. When partially purified, these receptor populations contain protein kinase C activity, in support of the identity of protein kinase C and the receptor. This study demonstrates that a phenotypic change in a clonal cell population correlates with the up regulation of the phorbol ester receptor-calcium-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase. This variant cell line is a useful model for analyzing the relationship between phorbol ester binding and protein kinase C during differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Perrella, F W', 'Hellmig, B D', 'Diamond, L']","['Perrella FW', 'Hellmig BD', 'Diamond L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Feb;46(2):567-72.,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

A candidate for such a target is DNA topoisomerase II, a ubiquitous enzyme that alters three-dimensional conformation of supercoiled DNA. DNA intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins stabilize a DNA and topoisomerase II complex. The process of stabilization probably represents the poisoning of an intermediate state in the normal functioning of the enzyme. This stabilized intermediate state can be measured in whole cells using the filter elution method of Kohn to quantify protein-associated DNA cleavage produced when the cells are exposed to intercalators or epipodophyllotoxins. By altering cell populations in quantifiable ways, four factors appear to influence the magnitude of drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and cytotoxicity: the proliferative state of the cell (proliferating cells are more sensitive than quiescent ones); the cell cycle state (cells pharmacologically recruited into G1-S are more sensitive than asynchronously growing cells); the chromatin conformation (DNA methylation, polyamine depletion, and other chromosomal changes can alter the magnitude of topoisomerase II-mediated effects); the cellular phenotype (in an as yet uncharacterized manner, malignant cells apparently are more sensitive to topoisomerase II-mediated events than normal cells). These data suggest that the biochemical basis of the therapeutic index of drugs such as the intercalating agents or epipodophyllotoxins may be the intrinsic hypersensitivity of the topoisomerase II in malignant cells to poisoning by these drugs.","['Zwelling, L A']",['Zwelling LA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/genetics', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Podophyllotoxin/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00048092 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1985;4(4):263-76. doi: 10.1007/BF00048092.,['CA 40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],62,,,,,,,,,

Two major conclusions can be drawn from the findings of multiple marker analysis: 1) differentiation of leukemia is not abnormal but blocked (""maturation arrest""), and leukemic cells retain normal maturation-linked markers; and 2) no leukemia specific marker could be detected so far. Although leukemic cells show general qualitative features in common with normal cells, some quantitative characteristics of these similar attributes are peculiar to leukemic blasts. Qualitative and quantitative enzymological characteristics help to identify the cell lineage involved and to determine the developmental point at which maturation arrest occurs. The expression of isoenzymes is often linked to the presumptive sequence of developmental stages. Subsets within ALL subtypes showed pronounced modifications in their isoenzyme patterns associated with increasing maturity. Thus, enzyme markers can provide refined definitions of subgroups by biochemical criteria. Based on recent observations using the enzyme markers TdT, adenosine deaminase, 5'-nucleotidase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, acid phosphatase, and hexosaminidase, a scheme of enzymological expression in the various commonly accepted subtypes of acute lymphoid leukemia and acute nonlymphoid leukemia is presented. Enzyme marker analysis represents a useful tool as an adjunctive method in multiple marker analysis for assessing diagnosis, prognosis, and the evolutionary and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the spectrum of leukemia subtypes. Furthermore, enzyme marker analysis may provide further insight into certain aspects of the pathobiology of leukemia which might not be elucidated by other methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Acid Phosphatase/blood', 'Adenosine Deaminase/blood', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/blood', 'Esterases/blood', 'Hexosaminidases/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Nucleotidases/blood', 'Phenotype', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/blood']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-198507030-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1985 Fall;7(3):283-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198507030-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro translation of hybrid-selected RNA unequivocally demonstrates that this protein, designated p38(XBL), is indeed encoded by the XBL gene. Unlike the other virus-encoded proteins, however, p38(XBL) resides within the cells without being incorporated into virions. It undergoes no gross post-translational modifications and has a relatively short half-life (5-6 hr) in vivo. Furthermore, cell fractionation combined with pulse-chase experiment reveals that a significant fraction (more than half) of the p38(XBL) localizes to the nucleus of the infected cell after synthesis. We conclude that the XBL gene of bovine leukemia virus is a functional gene encoding a nonvirion protein p38(XBL), which possibly functions within the nucleus of the infected cell to regulate viral or cellular gene expression. p38(XBL) is presumably translated from a doubly spliced, bicistronic mRNA that has the capability to encode another small polypeptide in a different reading frame.","['Sagata, N', 'Tsuzuku-Kawamura, J', 'Nagayoshi-Aida, M', 'Shimizu, F', 'Imagawa, K', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Sagata N', 'Tsuzuku-Kawamura J', 'Nagayoshi-Aida M', 'Shimizu F', 'Imagawa K', 'Ikawa Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.23.7879 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Dec;82(23):7879-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.23.7879.,,,,PMC390873,,,,,,,

The unique fourth gene, chi (also referred to as lor), is located between env and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), encoding a protein of relative molecular mass 40,000 for HTLV-I and 37,000 for HTLV-II, located in the nucleus of infected cells. HTLV-I is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL), a T-lymphocyte malignancy, while HTLV-II has been found associated with a T-cell variant of hairy cell leukaemia. Both viruses immortalize T cells in vitro. However, the mechanism of cellular transformation induced by HTLV is not known as there seems to be no common site of provirus integration in primary ATL cells and the virus contains no classical oncogene sequences. These observations have provoked speculation that the unique and strongly conserved chi protein (85% amino-acid homology between HTLV-I and -II) is involved in HTLV leukaemogenesis. Recent mutagenesis experiments in our laboratory have shown that the chi gene is essential for HTLV replication. It has also has been shown that the LTRs of HTLV and the related bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) are activated in trans in virus-infected cells, and, although such experiments did not directly demonstrate a role for the chi protein in transcriptional activation, it has been suggested that the chi protein is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the LTR and may be involved in cellular transformation.

The indomethacin effect was titratable and gave significant reversal between 1 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-10) M. The indomethacin inhibition of the prostaglandin synthesis does not appear to be the mechanism of action in its ability to reverse FeLV suppression of Con A receptor mobility. Since the addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (1.0 microM) was also able to reverse the FeLV-induced inhibition and neither indomethacin nor PGE2 had an observable effect on Con A receptor mobility of normal PBL without FeLV present. PBL from FeLV-infected cats were sensitive to indomethacin (1.0-10.0 microM) and an indomethacin-related increase in cap formation was observed. Since both indomethacin and PGE2 were able to reverse the FeLV-induced suppression it was concluded that their mechanism of action may be through a common site.

Reduced thymus cellularity due to the thymolytic effect of both RadLV variants (30-40% cell reduction within 24 h after intrathymic virus injection) was accompanied with elevated H-2 expression on thymocytes. A high density of H-2D and to a lesser degree increased expression of H-2K were observed following infection with both virus variants. This elevated H-2 expression was maintained transiently for 6-7 weeks in the resistant situation and persisted in the sensitive situation until overt leukemia developed. The occurrence of A-RadLV transformed cells in 75% of the tested thymuses within 10 days after infection (vs 16% in D-RadLV treated mice) and their further expansion until overt leukemia developed could explain the continued expression of elevated H-2 expression on thymocytes in the sensitive situation. The majority (85%) of the primary A-RadLV induced leukemias tested expressed more H-2D/H-2K gene products than normal thymocytes.

In this study, we identified the chromosomal map location of Mlvi-1, Mlvi-2, and Mlvi-3 in the rat by using mouse-rat somatic cell hybrids that lose the rat chromosomes.

Extensive sequence analysis of the BALB/c endogenous provirus showed that it differed from the sequence of the AKR-derived provirus at approximately 0.5% of 4,500 sequenced nucleotides.

To localize the region of the SFFV envelope gene responsible for these differences, we utilized a recombinant virus containing the 3' half of the SFFVP env gene, where the vast majority of the differences between SFFVP and SFFVA reside, and the SFFVP long terminal repeat (LTR) on an SFFVA background. Analysis of the recombinant virus indicates that it is capable of inducing all of the biological effects previously associated with SFFVP, including the ability to proliferate and differentiate without the need for erythropoietin. In addition, the env gene product of the recombinant virus can be detected on the cell surface, a property previously associated only with SFFVP.

However, the pure defective components have not been previously available. We prepared the defective spleen focus-forming virus component of Rauscher erythroleukemia virus (R-SFFV) by transfecting a colinear R-SFFV DNA clone into a retroviral packaging cell line (psi 2 cells). The transfected cells released virus (psi 2/SFFV) that was free of helper virus and that induced erythropoietin-dependent erythroid burst formation in bone marrow cultures. When injected into normal adult NIH/Swiss mice in moderate doses, psi 2/SFFV caused a rapid splenic erythroblastosis that regressed. Extensive erythroblastosis could be maintained by repeated injections of psi 2/SFFV into anemic mice or by the addition of a helper virus. We conclude that R-SFFV alone causes proliferation but not immortalization of a population of erythroblasts that is normally replenished from a precursor stem cell pool. Because these precursor cells are inefficiently infected, a single moderate inoculum of psi 2/SFFV causes a wave of erythroblastosis. The properties of the proliferating erythroblasts are substantially determined by the R-SFFV viral component.","['Bestwick, R K', 'Hankins, W D', 'Kabat, D']","['Bestwick RK', 'Hankins WD', 'Kabat D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Helper Viruses/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*pathogenicity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.56.3.660-664.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Dec;56(3):660-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.56.3.660-664.1985.,['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC252634,,,,,,,

The generation of such CTL was shown to be controlled by at least three genetic loci including H-2 and Fv-1. The Fv-1n phenotype was able to negate positive immune response gene effects of the H-2b haplotype. Fv-1n-mediated inhibition appeared to operated by allowing the early expression by normal cells of N-ecotropic leukemia virus-related antigens recognized by the antiviral CTL, perhaps via tolerance induction. In the present study, the expression of CTL-defined viral antigens by normal cells is further considered. Possible gene dosage effects by H-2 as well as Fv-1 and the other virus-related (V) genes, including proviral structural loci, were examined by comparison of a panel of congenic and F1 mice. These experiments indicated that the quantitative level of expression of CTL-defined viral antigens was primarily controlled by the Fv-1 genotype. Gene dosage effects were also observed for the V genes and, in some situations, for H-2. The importance of the early display of viral antigens by normal cells was underscored by the inability of those mice to generate specific antiviral CTL responses. Even strains expressing low levels of viral antigens, such as responder X nonresponder (AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b X AKR.H-2b)F1 mice, failed to respond.

Furthermore, a rat LGL leukemia (RNK) exhibited a chemotactic response to both f-MLP and casein.

Possible role of ATL-derived factor (ADF) on constitutive IL 2 receptor expression of HTLV-I(+) T cell lines.,3995-4003,"Interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor (IL 2-R) is constitutively expressed on T cell lines established from the patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL), which is a human T cell leukemia lymphoma virus (HTLV-1)(+) T4(+)-leukemia endemic in Japan, the United States, and other countries. Many of these cell lines continuously produce an acidic lymphokine, ATL-derived factor (ADF), which preferentially induces the synthesis and expression of IL 2-R on a sensitive HTLV-1(-) non-T cell line (YT). The induced IL 2-R was characterized by the binding of 125I-IL 2 and flow cytometry by using fluoresceinated anti-human IL 2-R monoclonal antibodies (anti-Tac). Scatchard analysis with 125I-IL 2 showed ADF induced high-affinity receptor sites on YT cells. To test the possibility that ADF produced by HTLV-1(+) T cells is involved in the abnormal expression of IL 2-R, we studied the effect of ADF on an HTLV-1(+) IL 2-dependent T cell line (ED) in which the beta-chain gene of the T cell antigen receptor (T beta) was rearranged. Unlike IL 2-independent HTLV-1(+) cell lines that constitutively expressed Il 2-R, the IL 2-R expression on ED cells declined in the absence of crude IL 2 or recombinant IL 2. When either ADF or recombinant IL 2 was added to the culture of ED cells, there was a dose-dependent enhancement of IL 2-R expression in 24 hr. ADF and IL 2 showed a synergism in the IL 2-R induction, and both factors were needed to induce the maximal receptor expression in these T cells. The lack of IL 2 production by ADF-treated YT, as well as ED cell line suggested IL 2 may not be involved in the IL 2-R induction by ADF.

This state probably develops as a sequence of events in which the earliest stages may be difficult to detect by conventional pathological techniques. The process is characterised by genetic changes leading to abnormal control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Expansion of an abnormal clone may be related to independence from normal growth factors, insensitivity to normal inhibitory factors, suppression of normal clonal growth, or changes in the immunological or nutritional condition of the host. The haematological picture is of peripheral blood cytopenias: a cellular bone marrow, and functional abnormalities of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic cells. In most cases marrow cells have an abnormal DNA content, often with disturbances of the cell cycle: an abnormal karyotype is common in premalignant clones. Growth abnormalities of erythroid or granulocyte-macrophage progenitors are common in marrow cultures, and lineage specific surface membrane markers indicate aberrations of differentiation. Progression of the disorder may occur through clonal expansion or through clonal evolution with a greater degree of malignancy. Current attempts to influence abnormal growth and differentiation have had only limited success. Clinical recognition of the syndrome depends on an acute awareness of the signs combined with the identification of clonal and functional abnormalities.","['Jacobs, A']",['Jacobs A'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/etiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cholecalciferol/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/therapeutic use', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Rats', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.38.11.1201 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1985 Nov;38(11):1201-17. doi: 10.1136/jcp.38.11.1201.,,229,,PMC499415,,,,,,,

These cell lines have been maintained in continuous culture with stable chromosome, immunophenotype, and enzyme characteristics for an 8- to 21-month period. Four of 6 T-cell lines expressed IGF-I, but not insulin, receptors. One T-cell line bound only insulin, and 1 T-cell line bound both hormones. Conversely, 9 of 12 B-cell lines had insulin, but not IGF-I, receptors. Two of these lines bound both hormones, and 1 line did not bind either hormone. IGF-II binding was less than 1.5%/10 million cells for all lines and was less than 1% for 13 of the 18 lines. Specific binding of GH was undetectable in all cell lines. Time, temperature, and pH dependence of peptide binding were characterized for the T-cell IGF-I receptor and the B-cell insulin receptor and were consistent with previously described models for these receptors. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cross-linked receptors revealed an apparent mol wt greater than 300K unreduced and a 130K binding subunit after dithiothreitol reduction for both the T-cell IGF-I and the B-cell insulin receptor. These cell lines thus provided a unique opportunity for the study of growth factor receptors in fully characterized clonal populations of human lymphoblasts. We conclude that specific receptors for IGF-I and insulin are present on T- and B-lymphoblasts; divergence of these receptors appears to be a characteristic of lymphoblasts, since T-cells preferentially expressed IGF-I receptors and B-cells expressed insulin receptors; and IGF-II binding was relatively low, while specific GH binding was undetectable on both T- and B-lymphoblasts. These results suggest that insulin and IGF-I may play a role in lymphocyte differentiation and metabolism.","['Lee, P D', 'Rosenfeld, R G', 'Hintz, R L', 'Smith, S D']","['Lee PD', 'Rosenfeld RG', 'Hintz RL', 'Smith SD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Somatomedin', 'Receptors, Somatotropin', 'Somatomedins/*metabolism']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem-62-1-28 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1986 Jan;62(1):28-35. doi: 10.1210/jcem-62-1-28.,"['34710/PHS HHS/United States', 'AM-07217-09/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-28229/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether regulation of transferrin receptors and ferritin were linked under these disparate conditions, serum-free and fetal bovine serum (FBS) cultures of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were used to investigate relationships between transferrin receptor display and intracellular ferritin. Using 125I-transferrin binding and immunofluorescence staining for transferrin receptors, HL60 cells cultured in serum-free, transferrin-free medium expressed fewer transferrin receptors and contained increased ferritin when compared to cells cultured with FBS or transferrin supplemented, serum-free medium. When placed in medium containing transferrin, cells previously grown in transferrin-free medium rapidly re-expressed transferrin receptors and decreased their ferritin content. HL60 cells induced to differentiate into granulocytes or macrophages also decreased transferrin receptor display and increased their ferritin content. Transferrin receptor display and ferritin content in both proliferating and differentiating myeloid leukemia cells are inversely related and their regulation is closely linked. Regulation of transferrin receptor display and ferritin synthesis may be important events regulating myeloid cell growth and differentiation.","['Rhyner, K', 'Taetle, R', 'Bering, H', 'To, D']","['Rhyner K', 'Taetle R', 'Bering H', 'To D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Ferritins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041250333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1985 Dec;125(3):608-12. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041250333.,"['CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

RNA complementary to the complete sequence of specific cDNA probes for both MuLV and globin was found in nuclei and cytoplasm of thymus, brain and liver at all ages studied. No significant age-dependent change in the amount or sequence complexity of globin RNA was detected. The amount of MuLV RNA in both nuclei and cytoplasm of thymus increased about five times from 2 to 5 months of age, but no significant change was observed over this age range in MuLV RNA from liver and brain. By the age of 10 months, most of the mice had developed leukemia and the thymus showed a further increase in the amount of MuLV RNA. Nuclear RNA from liver and brain then showed a significant increase in the amount of MuLV, but no change in the amount of MuLV was found in the cytoplasm. No qualitative age-dependent changes in the MuLV RNA sequence complexity in thymus, liver and brain were detected. These results suggest that in the AKR mouse strain for the three tissues studied, an age-dependent relaxation occurs in the repression of the MuLV genome but not for alpha- and beta-globin genes. The rate of the depression of MuLV genes in the short-lived AKR mouse strain appears similar to that of the long-lived C57BL/6J mouse strain. This age-dependent relaxation of MuLV genes appears to be limited to the nuclei. Thus, the presence of a specific regulatory system for the transport of MuLV RNA through the nuclear membrane which does not deteriorate with age is indicated.","['Ono, T', 'Dean, R G', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Cutler, R G']","['Ono T', 'Dean RG', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Cutler RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Gerontology,Gerontology,7601655,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism/microbiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Liver/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Thymus Gland/*metabolism/microbiology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000212725 [doi]'],ppublish,Gerontology. 1985;31(6):362-72. doi: 10.1159/000212725.,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the cell type specificity seen in vivo can be reproduced in vitro. The transcriptional enhancement requires the presence of enhancer sequences in cis and also of a common factor interacting in trans with all three enhancer sequences.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether HTLV1 had any pathogenetic role for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The incidence of antibodies to ATL cell-associated antigens (ATLA) in sera from patients with SLE and other collagen diseases was investigated by an indirect immunofluorescent cytoplasmic staining of an HTLV1-infected cell line (MT-1). A radioimmunoassay was also performed to detect antibodies to HTLV1 protein and crude membrane fraction derived from an HTLV1-producing cell line MT-2. Furthermore, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell line (ES-1) was constructed from an SLE patient, which produced a monoclonal antibody (IgG, lambda) reactive to an HTLV1-related cell-membrane antigen expressed on MT-1 and MT-2 cells. The specific reactivity of the monoclonal antibody was analysed by an indirect immunofluorescent cell-membrane staining and a microcytotoxicity test. The incidence of anti-ATLA antibodies was not different among SLE and other collagen diseases. The monoclonal antibody produced by ES-1 stained and killed HTLV1-infected cell lines specifically, but did not react with other human lymphoid cell lines. This monoclonal antibody failed to react with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), mitogen-induced T cell blasts, and iododeoxyuridine-treated T cells from SLE patients. Thus, a possible role of HTLV1 in the aetiology of SLE was not established.","['Kurata, A', 'Katamine, S', 'Fukuda, T', 'Mine, M', 'Ikari, N', 'Kanazawa, H', 'Matsunaga, M', 'Eguchi, K', 'Nagataki, S']","['Kurata A', 'Katamine S', 'Fukuda T', 'Mine M', 'Ikari N', 'Kanazawa H', 'Matsunaga M', 'Eguchi K', 'Nagataki S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Collagen Diseases/etiology', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/etiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/diagnosis']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1985 Oct;62(1):65-74.,,,,PMC1577413,,,,,,,

Curative treatment is defined as the proportion of patients who survive beyond the time after which the risk of treatment failure approaches zero, i.e., the disease-free survival plateau. This progress has resulted from a closely integrated scientific effort, including drug development, pharmacology, preclinical modeling, experimental design with respect to clinical trials, quantitative criteria for response, and a series of clinical trials (initially in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia) in which the importance of complete remission, of dose and schedule, of sequencing chemotherapeutic agents, of pharmacological sanctuaries, and particularly of combination chemotherapy was studied. The principles derived from these studies, particularly those relating to combination chemotherapy, resulted in curative treatment for disseminated Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pediatric solid tumors, testicular cancer, and limited small cell lung cancer. Many patients with certain stages of solid tumors, such as breast cancer and osteogenic sarcoma, are at high risk of having disseminated microscopic disease. Experimental studies indicate that treatment which is only partially effective against macroscopic disease is much more effective against microscopic tumors. Therefore chemotherapy is administered immediately following control of the primary tumor in patients at high risk of having disseminated microscopic disease, a treatment known as adjuvant chemotherapy. This program has been highly successful in increasing the cure rate in patients with pediatric solid tumors and in prolonging disease-free survival in patients with premenopausal breast cancer. Given dissemination of the technology, it is estimated that 15,000-30,000 patients per year are potentially curable in the United States. Curability of cancer by chemotherapy generally is inversely related to age, i.e., the above tumors are most common in children and young adults. There are new and promising treatment strategies, such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. The revolution in molecular and cellular biology is providing an increase in targets, rationale, and opportunity for more effective and novel chemotherapeutic approaches.","['Frei, E 3rd']",['Frei E 3rd'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy', 'Choriocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Rectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):6523-37.,,197,,,,,,,,,

During spontaneous lymphomagenesis in AKR mice, amplified expression of gag or env gene-coded virus antigens on the surface of thymocytes preceded leukemia development and evidence for amplification of other virus genes. These changes generally appeared before 6 mo. Similar viral gene expression and viral gene amplification occurred in the thymus and spleen cells of leukemia-resistant chimeric mice.

Flow cytometric analysis showed amplification of the virus genes in mice protected from leukemia-lymphoma by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from leukemia-resistant mice. Allogeneic chimeras and syngeneically transplanted mice both showed evidence of accelerated viremia and of recombinant virus formation.

In L1210/R cells, resistance to ara-C was correlated with low deoxycytidine-cytidine kinase activity (0.04 nmol/mg protein/min), with a low level of intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP, with a low level of incorporation of ara-C into DNA, and with no significant inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA. Thus a simple measurement of the intracellular pool of total ara-C nucleotides is sufficient to identify cells with this type of resistance. In contrast, in cells with sufficient deoxycytidine-cytidine kinase activity (greater than 0.1 nmol/mg protein/min), the factors determining the quality of response to ara-C could be distinguished as follows: (a) those which are responsible for in vitro cytotoxicity (producing in vivo cytoreduction); and (b) those which are responsible for in vivo selectivity (producing long term survivors). In P288 cells which are sensitive in vitro to ara-C, the determining factor for this sensitivity is the amount of ara-CTP formed which produced greater than 80% inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA. The lack of antitumor activity in vivo, however, was due to similarities in ara-CTP retention in target tumor cells (P288) and normal bone marrow cells. In both cases, ara-CTP retention at 4 h was less than 10% of the value obtained at 30 min. In contrast, in cells such as L1210 and P1798 long term survivors (cures) were directly correlated with higher ara-CTP retention. For example, 4 h after drug administration, ara-CTP retentions were 20, 82, and 6% for L1210, P1798, and bone marrow cells, respectively. At 24 h, 20% ara-CTP was retained intracellularly by P1798 tumor cells. In summary, results presented herein demonstrate the importance of differential ara-CTP retention as the most critical determinant of response for the induction of long term survivors, and ara-C incorporation into DNA by tumor cells after in vivo treatment appears to be less significant. These data also demonstrate close correlation between ara-CTP pools, retention, and the extent of inhibition of recovery of thymidine incorporation into DNA.","['Riva, C M', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Riva CM', 'Rustum YM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.14 (cytidylate kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.4 (Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):6244-9.,['CA18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Pyran copolymer-induced peritoneal cells endowed the tumour vaccine-primed mice, but not unprimed mice, with resistance to implanted L1210 and, among those peritoneal cell populations, macrophages but not T cells were responsible for this effect since the activity was associated with a cell population which was adherent to nylon wool columns, sensitive to silica and insensitive to anti-Thy 1.2 antibody plus complement. The pyran copolymer-induced peritoneal cells had very little antiproliferative activity when tested against L1210 in vitro and mice inoculated with these peritoneal cells did not survive a challenge of live L1210 cells much longer (less than 1 day) than L1210 inoculated control mice. Furthermore, the survival of L1210 vaccine-primed mice inoculated with one-tenth the amount of live L1210 (10(2)) was still much shorter than that of mice primed with L1210 vaccine plus pyran copolymer and challenged with ten times as many (10(3)) live L1210 cells.

No reactions were obtained with carcinomas of unrelated origin or with normal urothelial cells. However, the antibody also reacted with a similar antigen on some cell lines of B lymphocyte origin. Using large panels of target cells we have now shown that this reactivity was entirely restricted to cells of the B lineage within the haematopoietic system. As opposed to its apparent restriction to malignant cells of the urothelium, the S2C6 antigen was expressed by normal B lymphocytes as well as by many malignant B cells (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia and immunocytoma). Pre-B cells derived from acute lymphocytic leukaemia and plasma cells from multiple myeloma lacked the antigen. Expression was significantly enhanced on cultured B cells from Burkitt lymphomas and on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines including those of the pre-B phenotype derived from fetal bone marrow. As judged from the molecular size and the distribution pattern displayed by the S2C6 antigen it appears to be distinct from other B cell antigens previously described. A possible relation of the S2C6 antigen to a receptor for B cell growth factors is discussed.","['Paulie, S', 'Ehlin-Henriksson, B', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Koho, H', 'Ben-Aissa, H', 'Perlmann, P']","['Paulie S', 'Ehlin-Henriksson B', 'Mellstedt H', 'Koho H', 'Ben-Aissa H', 'Perlmann P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Carcinoma/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199769 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1985;20(1):23-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00199769.,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic origin of the bone marrow cells and various peripheral blood populations was analyzed in 14 patients. We found at least one informative polymorphism for each donor-recipient pair. Additional markers of engraftment included cytogenetic analysis, HLA typing, and red cell typing. By DNA analysis, four patients had complete engraftment, five had partial engraftment, and five had no evidence of donor cell engraftment. In three cases, DNA analysis permitted detection of minor populations (5% to 10%) of donor or host cells. Eight of fourteen patients were evaluable for chimerism posttransplant by cytogenetic analysis. In five cases, cytogenetic results were completely concordant with DNA analyses. In two cases of apparent autologous recovery, as assessed using RFLPs, a small number of cells of donor karyotype was seen. In one other case, a small number of cells of host karyotype was not detected by RFLP studies. HLA typing in three partially engrafted patients was purely either of donor or host type.

These observations indicate that activation of N-ras oncogenes is independent of the specific stage of cell differentiation or the leukemia phenotype. The other two transforming genes associated with an acute myelogenous leukemia and an acute lymphocytic leukemia showed homology neither with members of the ras gene family nor with the human Blym-1 gene.

In this study, most of these lymphomas have been identified as B-cell in origin by morphologic features, identification of immunoglobulin class, and cell-surface antigens. The classification suggested by Pattengale and Taylor proved to be applicable to the lymphomas studied. Most were of large follicular center cells and are considered typical of the type formerly designated as ""reticulum cell sarcoma, type B."" Many lymphomas contained a large proportion of nonneoplastic cells which partially obscured their neoplastic component. The role of ecotropic murine leukemia viruses as etiologic agents for B-cell lymphomas remains equivocal.

Fifty-eight sera with anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B (La), and other undefined specificities were found to react with several major viral polypeptide bands. Most of them corresponded to gag-gene-encoded products: pr65gag, p40gag, p30, p15, p12 and p10. Other bands with molecular weights averaging 90K, 60K, 45K, and 28K were recognized by a few sera. Immunological specificity of the reaction was assessed by reproducing the tests with IgG purified from sera and from corresponding F(ab')2 fragments. Moreover, the specificity of the reaction with gag proteins was confirmed by repeating the tests with p30 and p15 prior purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-p30 and anti-p15 goat sera. Furthermore, the gag polypeptides were recognized by human sera by replacing MSV-(MLV) by three other murine retroviruses of different origin. An indirect confirmation of these results was obtained by applying this method to sera of MRL lpr/lpr mice which develop an autoimmune syndrome comparable to that of human systemic lupus erythematosus. In agreement with previously published results (C. Rordorf, C. Gambke, and J. Gordon (1983), J. Immunol. Methods 59, 105-112), we found that anti-gag-gene antibodies were present in the sera of individual mice. Patterns of reactivity were found to vary with the age of the animals. No retroviral polypeptide was significantly detected in the great majority (80%) of sera from normal donors. However, 5 out of 25 sera showed faint bands although to a lesser extent than pathological sera. These five sera also reacted with HeLa cell purified HnRNPs, suggesting that their normal status should be reconsidered.","['Rucheton, M', 'Graafland, H', 'Fanton, H', 'Ursule, L', 'Ferrier, P', 'Larsen, C J']","['Rucheton M', 'Graafland H', 'Fanton H', 'Ursule L', 'Ferrier P', 'Larsen CJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Connective Tissue Diseases/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/immunology']",1985/07/30 00:00,1985/07/30 00:01,['1985/07/30 00:00'],"['1985/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(85)90287-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1985 Jul 30;144(2):468-80. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(85)90287-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

Ruta, R. Bestwick, C. Machida, and D. Kabat, 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 4704-4708). In newborn NIH/Swiss mice, these mutant SFFVs form revertants that are pathogenic in mice of all ages. At least two of three studied revertants contain second site env mutations which affect the sizes and proteolytic fragmentation patterns of their encoded glycoproteins. A variety of structural and genetic evidence suggests that the xenotropic- and ecotropic-related regions of the SFFV glycoprotein fold into separate globular domains that are connected by a flexible proline-rich joint.

In order to cleave SSV p65, retroviral particles containing this antigen were incubated with extracts from the heterologous helper virus Friend leukemia virus (FLV).

Kinetics experiments with two amino acids ([3H]leucine, [35S]cysteine) revealed that initial processing of SSV p65 produced SSV p55 and SSV p10, with subsequent processing of SSV p55 occurring thereafter. In contrast to the Moloney system, the major intermediate p40 (p30, p10) could not be clearly demonstrated.

In order to confirm these results the sequence of portions of a second clone, derived from a virus-producing cell line, was also determined. The gag gene was found to consist of 1179 nucleotides, which probably encode only three proteins: an N-terminal protein of 109 amino acids, a major core protein (p24) of 215 amino acids, and a nucleic acid binding protein (p12) of 69 residues. An open reading frame, whose translated product showed clear homology to the avian and murine proteases, was found beginning immediately upstream of the 3' end of gag. Following this protease region, a third long open reading frame, encoding 852 amino acids, showed clear homology to both avian and murine pol genes. The mechanism of translation of the protease and pol gene products cannot be predicted with certainty. Like Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), BLV has a termination signal at the 3' end of gag, but unlike M-MuLV the protease is in a different reading frame. Like Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), BLV has a termination signal at the 3' end of the protease region and the reverse transcriptase is in a different (i.e., the third) reading frame. Possible translation mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the BLV gag and pol gene products are highly related to those of the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV); relatedness varied from 37% amino acid identities within the N terminal gag protein to 54% within the nucleic acid binding protein. Highly significant homology with both murine and avian type-C proteins was found within p24, p12, and the putative protease, reverse transcriptase, and endonuclease. Based on this homology, the BLV-HTLV family of viruses appears about equally distantly related to murine and avian type-C viruses.","['Rice, N R', 'Stephens, R M', 'Burny, A', 'Gilden, R V']","['Rice NR', 'Stephens RM', 'Burny A', 'Gilden RV']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, gag', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1985/04/30 00:00,1985/04/30 00:01,['1985/04/30 00:00'],"['1985/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(85)90344-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1985 Apr 30;142(2):357-77. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(85)90344-7.,['N01-C0-23909/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,['GENBANK/M10987'],,,,,,

The N-myc gene, first detected by its homology to the second exon of the c-myc gene, is amplified and/or expressed in tumours or cell lines derived from neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and SCLC. Here we describe a third myc-related gene (L-myc) cloned from SCLC DNA with homology to a small region of both the c-myc and N-myc genes. Human genomic DNA shows an EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of L-myc defined by two alleles (10.0- and 6.6-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragments), neither associated disproportionately with SCLC. Mouse and hamster DNAs exhibit a 12-kb EcoRI L-myc homologue, which indicates conservation of the gene in mammals. Gene mapping studies assign L-myc to human chromosome region 1p32, a location distinct from that of either c-myc or N-myc but associated with cytogenetic abnormalities in certain human tumours. This L-myc sequence is amplified 10-20-fold in four SCLC cell line DNAs and in one SCLC tumour specimen taken directly from a patient. Either the 10.0- or 6.6-kb allele can be amplified and in heterozygotes only one of the two alleles was amplified in any SCLC genome. SCLC cell lines with amplified L-myc sequences express L-myc-derived transcripts not seen in SCLC with amplified c-myc or N-myc genes. In addition, some SCLCs without amplification also express L-myc-related transcripts. Together, these findings suggest an enlarging role for myc-related genes in human lung cancer and provide evidence for the concept of a myc family of proto-oncogenes.","['Nau, M M', 'Brooks, B J', 'Battey, J', 'Sausville, E', 'Gazdar, A F', 'Kirsch, I R', 'McBride, O W', 'Bertness, V', 'Hollis, G F', 'Minna, J D']","['Nau MM', 'Brooks BJ', 'Battey J', 'Sausville E', 'Gazdar AF', 'Kirsch IR', 'McBride OW', 'Bertness V', 'Hollis GF', 'Minna JD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, 1-3', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1985/11/07 00:00,1985/11/07 00:01,['1985/11/07 00:00'],"['1985/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/318069a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Nov 7-13;318(6041):69-73. doi: 10.1038/318069a0.,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution at the 5'-position resulted in decreased efficacy as inhibitors of uridine kinase, particularly if the substituent was large. None of the analogs with 5'-position modifications effectively inhibited salvage of uridine by intact L1210 cells.

Five hundred cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were examined for antibody to ATL-associated antigen (ATLA). Clinico-pathological and epidemiological features for these cases were compared according to their anti-ATLA antibody status. The new results obtained from this survey are as follows: All of the patients with ATL in Kyushu had anti-ATLA antibody, but several patients with ATL in other districts had no anti-ATLA antibody, suggesting that there was no association with ATL virus (ATLV) infection in these cases. There was a difference in the histopathological patterns in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma between Kyushu and the other districts, which was due to the difference in distribution of the ATLV-associated lymphoid malignancies, namely ATL, in each area.

Infectious chimeric MuLVs, recovered from NIH 3T3 cells microinjected with these DNAs, were inoculated into newborn NIH Swiss, SIM.S, and SWR/J mice to test their leukemogenic potential. We found that each chimeric MuLV, harboring either the long terminal repeat, the gag-pol, or the pol-env region of the Cas-BR-E MuLV genome, was leukemogenic, indicating that this virus harbors several determinants of leukemogenicity mapping in different regions of its genome. This result suggests that the amphotropic 4070-A MuLV has multiple regions along its genome which prevent the expression of its leukemogenic phenotype, and it also shows that substitution of only one of these regions for Cas-BR-E MuLV sequences is sufficient to make it leukemogenic.","['Jolicoeur, P', 'DesGroseillers, L']","['Jolicoeur P', 'DesGroseillers L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chimera', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Paralysis/microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.56.2.639-643.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Nov;56(2):639-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.56.2.639-643.1985.,,,,PMC252625,,,,,,,

By employing a radioimmunoassay it could be shown that DBP-related proteins were synthesized in two of the cell lines containing the Ad5 DBP gene. Since both cell lines support the growth of the temperature-sensitive viral DBP mutant, H5ts125, at the non-permissive temperature, the DBP-related proteins expressed in these cells must be functional.","['Laanen, H J', 'Zelle, B', 'Lenstra, R', 'de Antoni, G', 'Rozijn, T H', 'Sussenbach, J S']","['Laanen HJ', 'Zelle B', 'Lenstra R', 'de Antoni G', 'Rozijn TH', 'Sussenbach JS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HindIII)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics/growth & development', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease HindIII', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Plasmids', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-66-11-2395 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1985 Nov;66 ( Pt 11):2395-406. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-66-11-2395.,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that hemin regulates the expression of the receptor via alterations in the rate of receptor biosynthesis. However, this effect can be completely abolished by addition of desferrioxamine, an intracellular iron chelator. Competition curves demonstrate that desferrioxamine and hemin affect the same intracellular iron pool. Since the chelator cannot remove iron from heme, we propose that hemin acts simply by delivering iron to a chelatable iron pool and that levels of chelatable iron provide the regulatory signal for expression of the transferrin receptor gene.","['Rouault, T', 'Rao, K', 'Harford, J', 'Mattia, E', 'Klausner, R D']","['Rouault T', 'Rao K', 'Harford J', 'Mattia E', 'Klausner RD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Heme/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1985/11/25 00:00,1985/11/25 00:01,['1985/11/25 00:00'],"['1985/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)38652-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Nov 25;260(27):14862-6.,,,,,,,,,,,

At 4 degrees C myeloid differentiated, but not undifferentiated, monocytic differentiated or eosinophilic differentiated HL-60 cells display marked specific leukotriene B4 binding. Leukotriene B4 binding at 4 degrees C reaches a maximum within 10 min, is readily reversed by unlabeled leukotriene B4, and is stereospecific. Only molecules with structural and biological similarity to leukotriene B4 can competitively inhibit leukotriene B4 binding. Scatchard analysis at 4 degrees C in differentiated cells shows two classes of binding sites. The high affinity sites have a Kd of 0.27 nM and a Bmax of 14.8 fmol/10(7) cells; the low affinity sites have a Kd of 0.58 microM and a Bmax of 2453 fmol/10(7) cells. The appearance of specific leukotriene B4 binding sites in the myeloid differentiated cells correlates with their ability to chemotax in response to leukotriene B4. Undifferentiated cells do not chemotax to leukotriene B4. At 37 degrees C leukotriene B4 is incorporated into phospholipid and triglyceride species in both undifferentiated and myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells making binding studies at 37 degrees C in intact cells impossible. No evidence of omega-hydroxylase activity was found in HL-60 cells.

OKT3 (anti-T3), WT-31 (anti-receptor constant region), and T40/25 (anti-receptor variable region) also enhance the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger in these cells. The associated rise in pHi was dependent on the presence of external Ca2+ and Na+, was inhibited by dimethylamiloride and La3+, and was maintained for at least 20 min. Phorbol esters, which are co-mitogenic in T cells and activate protein kinase C, also stimulated the exchanger, but by a mechanism not requiring an elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+; the rise in pHi rapidly peaked and returned to baseline levels within 20 min. Pretreatment with phorbols prevented an increase in pHi by OKT3 although a transient additive effect was observed when the two were added simultaneously. Receptor function was maintained in the presence of phorbol esters as OKT3 still stimulated a Ca2+ influx.

Amsterdam: Elsevier/North Holland, pp 103-123, 1980] who observed mutagen-dependent increases in small TK-deficient mutant colonies with detectable damage to the chromosome (11) that carries the TK locus. In this study, we tested these four chemicals for the induction of gene mutations at the ouabain-resistance (ouares) locus of 3.7.2C L5178Y cells to determine if presumptive chromosomal mutagens would go undetected at a gene locus that is unresponsive to chromosomal damage. A final concentration of 375 micrograms/ml ouabain in soft-agar medium selected against the ouabain-sensitive phenotype without loss of the mutagen-induced ouabain-resistant phenotype. Verification of the mutant phenotype was completed for six individual soft-agar ouares colonies derived from mutagen-treated cultures via growth for 10-11 days in nonselective medium followed by retesting for colony formation in selective soft-agar medium. Dose-related reproducible increases in the frequency of ouabain-resistant mutants were observed for 3.7.2C L5178Y cells that had been exposed for 3 hr to 24-46 micrograms/ml epichlorohydrin, 1.9-3.6 micrograms/ml iodomethane, 0.006-0.011 micrograms/ml N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and and 2.0-5.4 micrograms/ml methyl methanesulfonate. Also, treatments with EMS, which induced sufficient numbers of ouares colonies to permit analysis of colony size distribution, showed the existence of a bimodal size distribution similar to those reported for TK-deficient mutants. This discovery suggests that mutant colony size in this cell line may be independent of specific gene locus effects. We conclude that (1) chemicals that induce a high proportion of chromosomal mutants, as detected at the TK locus in earlier studies, also induce single gene mutations at the ouabain-resistance locus and (2) a bimodal distribution of mutant colony sizes in soft-agar medium after short expression periods may be a distinctive characteristic of the 3.7.2C L5178Y cell line and is not confined to the TK locus.","['Amacher, D E', 'Dunn, E M']","['Amacher DE', 'Dunn EM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Mutagen,Environmental mutagenesis,7909737,"['0 (Hydrocarbons, Iodinated)', '0 (Mutagens)', '08OOR508C0 (Epichlorohydrin)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)', 'DAT010ZJSR (methyl iodide)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Epichlorohydrin/toxicity', 'Hydrocarbons, Iodinated/toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/toxicity', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', 'Ouabain/*pharmacology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*genetics']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/em.2860070411 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mutagen. 1985;7(4):523-33. doi: 10.1002/em.2860070411.,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither HuIFN-alpha nor -beta, alone, from 1 to 1000 IU/ml, nor the homologous mock HuIFN preparations affected HL-60 cell differentiation or proliferation. Whereas the combination of HuIFN-alpha (10 to 1000 IU/ml) with DMSO also did not affect the proliferation or differentiation of HL-60 cells, the addition of HuIFN-beta (1000 IU/ml) and DMSO (1.25%) to growing cultures reduced cell viability as much as 14% of that observed for cells treated with DMSO alone or to 4% of that observed for either untreated cells or those treated with HuIFN-beta alone. The cytotoxic effect declined with decreasing concentrations of HuIFN-beta. The cytotoxic effect of DMSO and HuIFN-beta was exerted only as cells began to differentiate. Removal of HuIFN-beta at Day 2 did not reverse the cytotoxic effect, and addition of HuIFN-beta at Day 2 did not inhibit cell proliferation. Addition of HuIFN-beta to postmitotic cells on Day 4 after DMSO treatment did not affect proliferation but did slow differentiation. The cytotoxic and antidifferentiative effects of naturally produced HuIFN-beta were confirmed with highly purified recombinant HuIFN-beta. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells were resistant to the antiviral effects of HuIFN-beta, requiring 4 to 6 times the concentration to protect 50% of the cells against vesicular stomatitis virus as that needed to produce a cytotoxic or antidifferentiative effect.

Vitamin K3, in concentrations greater than 27 microM, caused time- and concentration-dependent depletion of the acid-soluble thiol (GSH) pool. Maximal GSH depletion to 15% of control occurred at 45 microM vitamin K3. Vitamin K3-mediated GSH depletion and vitamin K3-mediated growth inhibition were abrogated by coincubation with 1 mM cysteine or 1 mM reduced glutathione but not by 1 mM ascorbic acid or 180 microM alpha-tocopherol. Low concentrations of vitamin K3 (9-27 microM) elevated both the GSH pool and the total glutathione pool, the latter to a greater degree. Vitamin K3 also caused an increased rate of superoxide anion generation by L1210, maximal at 45 microM vitamin K3 (300% of control), and a concentration-dependent depletion of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) pools. Forty-fifty % depletion of the NADPH pool occurred after exposure to 27 microM vitamin K3 and 100% occurred at 36 microM vitamin K3; 27 microM vitamin K3 is a nontoxic concentration of vitamin K3. Loss of NADPH and total NADP was prevented by coincubation with 1 mM cysteine but not by coincubation with ascorbic acid or alpha-tocopherol. We conclude that tumor cell growth inhibition by vitamin K3 is modulated by acid-soluble thiols and may be caused by GSH pool and/or NADPH depletion. Toleration of partial NADPH depletion by L1210 cells may indicate that a threshold level of NADPH loss of greater than 50% is necessary for toxicity. NADPH depletion may be a toxic effect common to quinone drugs. Equitoxic concentrations of vitamin K3, phylloquinone, lapachol, dichlorolapachol, and doxorubicin caused L1210 NADPH pools to deplete to 30 +/- 10 (SD), 60 +/- 10, 60 +/- 11, and 80 +/- 12% of control, respectively. In contrast, GSH depletion may not be a common mechanism of toxicity.

Based on these results, it appears that most B cells and mature T cells in most CML patients are Ph1-negative, but that about 25% of patients have predominantly Ph1-positive B cells or a mixture of Ph1-positive and Ph1-negative B cells that are capable of growing as established cell lines after transformation with EBV.","['Nitta, M', 'Kato, Y', 'Strife, A', 'Wachter, M', 'Fried, J', 'Perez, A', 'Jhanwar, S', 'Duigou-Osterndorf, R', 'Chaganti, R S', 'Clarkson, B']","['Nitta M', 'Kato Y', 'Strife A', 'Wachter M', 'Fried J', 'Perez A', 'Jhanwar S', 'Duigou-Osterndorf R', 'Chaganti RS', 'Clarkson B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*classification', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79945-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Nov;66(5):1053-61.,"['CA-19117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

These data have led to the use of purine enzyme inhibitors as selective chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of T cell malignancies ranging from T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to cutaneous T cell lymphomas. We have compared the toxicities of 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, and thymidine for T cell lines derived from patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with those for mature T cell lines derived from patients with cutaneous T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. We have found that both deoxynucleosides are far less toxic to the mature T cell lies than to T lymphoblasts and that the mature cells accumulate much lower amounts of dATP and dGTP when exposed to deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, respectively. Similar studies performed on peripheral blood cells from patients with T cell leukaemias of mature phenotype and on peripheral blood T cells demonstrate similar low amounts of deoxynucleotide accumulation. Measurements of the activities of several purine metabolizing enzymes that participate in deoxynucleoside phosphorylation or degradation do not reveal differences which would explain the toxicity of deoxynucleosides for immature, as compared to mature, T cells. We conclude that deoxynucleoside metabolism in leukaemic T cells varies with their degree of differentiation.

Aminopyrine, phenobarbital, and Tween 80 evoked a reverse type I spectral change with a peak at 420-430 nm and a trough at 380-400 nm, whereas aniline and pyridine induced a modified type I (a reverse type II) spectral change characterized by a peak at 408 nm and a trough at 421 nm. These changes were found to be quantitatively proportional to the amounts of substrate added. However, the magnitude of the peaks and troughs was considerably less in the S1 fraction of the leukemic granulocytes.

Intracytoplasmic viral matrix inclusion bodies frequently appeared in the myocardium of adult chickens, but not in that of embryos. In light microscopic preparations, inclusions were irregularly distributed, were basophilic, and contained ribonucleic acid. Ultrastructurally, inclusions in myocardial cells were in areas containing numerous interstitial C-type particles. Early inclusions were composed of clusters of ribosomes associated with sarcoplasmic tubules; spherical bodies developed among these ribosomes. Mature inclusions were composed of numerous spherical bodies (50 to 75 nm) with interspersed ribosomes and of ribosomes clustered at the periphery. Inclusions were not membrane-enclosed. Occasionally, spherical bodies were in paracrystalline arrays. Multiple budding occurred on cell membranes adjacent to matrix inclusions. The viral group-specific protein, p27, was demonstrated by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method and by the protein A-gold method in the spherical bodies, in nucleoids of mature virus particles, and among ribosomes of inclusions.

This gene is essential for HTLV replication and acts by enhancing transcription from the HTLV long terminal repeat. The HTLV x gene product may also cause aberrant transcription of normal cellular genes, resulting in transformation of the infected cells. Although there is no evidence as yet for such a mechanism, it was shown that the HTLV-II x gene product can activate transcription from adenovirus E1A-dependent early promoters and therefore has the potential to activate cellular genes. It was also shown that the adenovirus and herpes pseudorabies immediate early proteins activate expression from the HTLV-I and HTLV-II long terminal repeats, though at lower levels than with the x gene product.

In 22 cases with minimal granulocytic component, 8 M5, 13 M6, 1 M7, no one (0%) showed an increased number of MPO-deficient PMN. In 3 (13%) of 23 cases with slight granulocytic component, 3 M0, 20 M1, and in 49 (57%) of 86 cases with granulocytic differentiation (53 M2, 1 M3, 32 M4), an increased number was demonstrated. This difference was statistically significant at a high level (P less than 0.0001). The number of MPO-deficient PMN could not be estimated in 15 cases of AML and 2 additional cases were mixed leukaemias. It is concluded that an increased number of MPO-deficient PMN in acute leukaemia speaks in favour not only of AML, but suggests the diagnosis of subtypes with some granulocytic component, most likely M1, M2, M3 or M4. Furthermore, the results support the concept that in AML at least some of the mature myeloid cells may be involved in the leukaemic process.","['Bendix-Hansen, K', 'Nielsen, H K']","['Bendix-Hansen K', 'Nielsen HK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],IM,"['Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Peroxidase/*deficiency']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1985.tb01567.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1985 Aug;35(2):174-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1985.tb01567.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

The iron uptake ability, studied by 59Fe labelling, varied considerably between individual tumour cell lines. The studies of the morphology of the Tf-TfR system by fluorescence based methods using labelling by FITC-Tf, and by indirect immunofluorescence (OKT9 anti-TfR monoclonal antibody) demonstrated that the iron uptake was the result of receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) of the Tf-TfR complex. The RME was better developed in the haemoglobin synthesizing K-562 cells than in the monocytic U-937 cells, suggesting that the intracellular iron processing capacity differs from cell type to cell type. The efficiency of iron-uptake, transport and storage was related to cell growth. Inhibition of growth by increasing cell densities or by drug treatments (phorbol ester TPA and difluoromethylornithine DFMO) was thus accompanied by a decrease in surface Tf binding, in cellular Tf handling capacity and in iron accumulation. TPA induced a redistribution of the TfR-pool to the intracellular space as demonstrated by morphology.","['Forsbeck, K', 'Nilsson, K']","['Forsbeck K', 'Nilsson K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1985.tb01563.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1985 Aug;35(2):145-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1985.tb01563.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

FV-P is a complex of two viruses, a replication-competent virus [Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)] and a replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFVp). We have addressed directly the role of SFFVp in the induction of the early stages of Friend disease by constructing stocks of SFFVp free of detectable F-MuLV, using a recently described retroviral helper-cell line. These preparations are capable of inducing erythroid bursts (vBFU-E) whose inducibility, kinetics, and responsiveness to erythropoietin suggest that they are very similar, if not identical, to the vBFU-E induced by FV-P. Single injections of helper-free SFFVp had no apparent effects in vivo, although the addition of exogenous helper virus to the inoculum resulted in the induction of classic Friend disease. Increasing the effective titer by giving mice five daily virus injections resulted in the induction of splenomegaly and a large increase in the number of erythroid colony-forming units that were independent of erythropoietin. When the injections were discontinued, the spleens regressed and all the mice survived. When the injections were continued, all the mice died within 25 days of the first injection. These results demonstrate that SFFVp alone can alter the growth characteristics of erythroid progenitors and is directly responsible for the induction of vBFU-E in vitro and the erythroid hyperplasia in vivo. They also demonstrate that the initial polyclonal stage of Friend disease is reversible and can be reproduced by using preparations of SFFVp free of detectable F-MuLV.","['Berger, S A', 'Sanderson, N', 'Bernstein, A', 'Hankins, W D']","['Berger SA', 'Sanderson N', 'Bernstein A', 'Hankins WD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Helper Viruses/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Time Factors']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.20.6913 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Oct;82(20):6913-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.20.6913.,,,,PMC390798,,,,,,,

To obtain proviral insertional mutants, we superinfected a subclone of these cells, which does not express the env surface protein of the Moloney leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV, the helper virus that was used to transmit the defective Ab-MuLV genome during transformation), with Mo-MuLV. Mutant clones that fail to express the C57BL/6 allele of B2m (B2mb) were then immunoselected by using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the B2mb gene product and not that of the B2ma allele. Of 22 independent clones obtained, one contains a proviral insertion that is near or in the first exon of the B2mb gene. Surprisingly, the insertion is of the Ab-MuLV genome and not of replication-competent Mo-MuLV. This indicates that superinfection with Mo-MuLV ""rescued"" the defective Ab-MuLV genome, which then inserted into the B2mb gene. We conclude that when an allele-specific selection procedure exists, proviral insertion is a potential method for obtaining mutations in heterozygous mammalian cells. This approach may thereby provide a method for molecular cloning of such selectable genes, using a retroviral hybridization probe.","['Frankel, W', 'Potter, T A', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Lenz, J', 'Rajan, T V']","['Frankel W', 'Potter TA', 'Rosenberg N', 'Lenz J', 'Rajan TV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clone Cells/analysis', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Liver', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', '*Mutation', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*genetics']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.19.6600 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Oct;82(19):6600-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.19.6600.,"['1 R01 CA29194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC391257,,,,,,,

Among these are the control of growth, stimulation of release of stored bioactive constituents and regulation of growth-factor surface receptors. Phorbol esters bind to and activate protein kinase C, leading to the phosphorylation of specific protein substrates presumed to be necessary for eliciting the full response. Strong evidence exists that specific binding of tumour promoter occurs at the membrane level in intact cells, resulting in activation of protein kinase C. Recent evidence concerning the release of bioactive constituents from platelets and neutrophils has linked agonist-induced protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization in a synergistic mechanism. Here we present a novel model of synergism between Ca2+ and phorbol esters that leads to transferrin receptor phosphorylation and down-regulation in HL-60 human leukaemic cells. Raising intracellular Ca2+, although ineffective by itself, increases the potency and rate of action of phorbol ester for activating protein kinase C and mediating transferrin receptor phosphorylation and down-regulation.

All investigated retroviral sequences are deletion mutants of MuLV proviruses. It was shown that the inner regions of proviruses diverged more than the long terminal repeats. The expression of the main inner MuLV polypeptide (p30) was detected in NIH 3T3 cells, transfected with DNA of some clones.","['Kolobkov, S L', 'Neznanov, N S', 'Domninskii, D A', 'Serov, S M', 'Grineva, K G']","['Kolobkov SL', 'Neznanov NS', 'Domninskii DA', 'Serov SM', 'Grineva KG']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Plasmids', 'Rauscher Virus/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 1985 Jul-Aug;19(4):890-902.,,,"Molekuliarnoe klonirovanie provirusov MuLV, integrirovannykh v genom myshinykh eritroleikoznykh kletok.

Reaction of the sodium salt of 4-chloro-6-methyl-2-(methylthio)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (6a) or 4,6-dichloro-2-(methylthio)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (6b) with 1-chloro-2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-p-toluoyl-alpha-D-erythro-pentofuranose (9) provided the corresponding N7 2'-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl blocked derivatives (8a and 8c) which, on ammonolysis, gave 4-amino-6-methyl-2-(methylthio)-7-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl )pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (11a) and 4-amino-6-chloro-2-(methylthio)-7-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl )pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (11b), respectively. Dethiation of 11a and 11b afforded 6-methyl-2'-deoxytubercidin (10a) and 6-chloro-2'-deoxytubercidin (10b), respectively. Dehalogenation of 10b provided an alternate route to the reported 2'-deoxytubercidin (3a). Application of this glycosylation procedure to 4,6-dichloro and 4,6-dichloro-2-methyl derivatives of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (15a and 15b) gave the corresponding blocked 2'-deoxyribonucleosides (18a and 18b), which on ammonolysis furnished 10b and 4-amino-6-chloro-2-methyl-7-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro- pentofuranosyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (17), respectively. This stereospecific attachment of the 2-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl moiety appears to be due to a Walden inversion at the C1 carbon by the anionic heterocyclic nitrogen. Controlled deacylation of 4-chloro-7-(2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-p-toluoyl-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl) pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (20a) gave 4-chloro-7-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidine (20b). Dehalogenation of 20b gave the 2'-deoxynebularin analogue 7-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (19), and reaction of 20b with thiourea gave 7-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4(3H)- thione (21). All of these compounds were tested in vitro against certain viruses and tumor cells. Only compounds 12a, 20b, and 21 showed significant activity against measles in vitro, and the activity is comparable to that of ribavirin. Although compounds 3a and 12b are slightly more active than ribavirin against HSV-2 in vitro, they are relatively more toxic to Vero cells.

Dose-response studies showed that both lipoxin A and lipoxin B inhibit, at submicromolar concentrations (ID50 10(-7) M), NK cell activity assayed against K562 target cells. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) also inhibited cytotoxicity, whereas both 15-HETE (5(S)-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid) and leukotriene B4 (synthetic and biologically derived) were ineffective. PGE2 stimulated a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP, which was accompanied by a decrease in NK target cell binding. Lipoxin A and lipoxin B did not elevate intracellular cAMP, nor did they inhibit target cell binding. Together these findings suggest that lipoxin A and lipoxin B abrogate NK cell cytotoxicity at a step distal to target effector cell recognition. In contrast, PGE2 appears to exert its effect, at least in part, on cytotoxicity indirectly by decreasing the binding between target and effector cells (in vitro). Moreover, they suggest that novel oxygenated derivatives of arachidonic acid (i.e., lipoxin A, lipoxin B) may regulate the activities of NK cells.","['Ramstedt, U', 'Ng, J', 'Wigzell, H', 'Serhan, C N', 'Samuelsson, B']","['Ramstedt U', 'Ng J', 'Wigzell H', 'Serhan CN', 'Samuelsson B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '73945-47-8 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '92950-25-9 (lipoxin B4)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dinoprostone', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/metabolism', '*Lipoxins', 'Prostaglandins E/pharmacology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Nov;135(5):3434-8.,['5R01-CA-26782-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

IL 2 alone had no effect on the proliferation of differentiation to immunoglobulin secretion in these cell populations; however, in conjunction with a variety of BCDF, differentiation to plaque-forming cells (PFC) was augmented 10- to 100-fold. There was no increase in proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. These effects could be demonstrated with concentrations of IL 2 as low as 5 U/culture, well within the physiologic range, by using either commercially available or recombinant IL 2. The addition of IL 2 to the B cell and BCDF cultures resulted in almost 100% expression of the IL 2 receptor, Tac, on the surface of these cells, and the augmented PFC response could be inhibited 70 to 80% by the addition of anti-Tac to the culture. Kinetic studies revealed that the addition of IL 2 to the B cell cultures could be delayed for up to 72 hr without a change in the PFC response, suggesting that IL 2 was acting as a secondary or synergistic signal for differentiation. Thus, it appears that IL 2 does have a role in B cell maturation mediated, in part, by IL 2 binding to the IL 2 receptor present on certain B cells.","['Mayer, L', 'Crow, M K', 'Thompson, C']","['Mayer L', 'Crow MK', 'Thompson C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Nov;135(5):3272-6.,"['AI-10811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-19080/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AM01523/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We have examined this proposed relationship in several ways. First, K562 (a cell line highly vulnerable to NK lysis) cells were grown for 24 h in the iron chelator desferrioxamine. Under these conditions, the cells doubled their surface transferrin receptor expression as determined both by radioligand binding and surface binding of the OK-T9 monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody. In contrast, cells grown for the same period of time in hemin halved their receptor expression. This fourfold change in transferrin receptor expression between the desferrioxamine-treated and hemin-treated cells produced no change in susceptibility to NK cytolysis. Second, HeLa (a cell line which in its native state is very resistant to NK cytolysis) cells were compared with K562 cells with respect to surface transferrin receptor expression. The difference in NK susceptibility of the two cell lines was not reflected in differences in transferrin receptor expression: the K562 cells expressed approximately 1.5 X 10(5) receptors per cell while HeLa cells expressed 2.0 X 10(5) receptors/cell. Third, infection of HeLa cells by measles virus greatly increased their susceptibility to NK lysis but produced no change in surface transferrin receptor expression. Furthermore, when measles-infected HeLa cells were grown for 6 d in medium supplemented with iron-saturated human transferrin they underwent a 50% reduction in receptor expression but no change in NK susceptibility. Finally, possible alterations in the surface expression of NK target antigens on modified cells were further assayed by their ability to serve as cold-target inhibitors of cytolysis of NK-sensitive target cells. We examined two groups of cells in which transferrin receptor expression was reduced. These were the transferrin-treated, measles-infected HeLa cells with the 50% receptor reduction, and K562 cells grown in medium containing hemin and iron salts where the reduction was five- to sixfold relative to control. In neither case was there a change in the apparent expression of NK target antigen(s). We conclude that there is a discordance between transferrin receptor expression and susceptibility to NK cytolysis in the model systems examined. Therefore, it is unlikely that the transferrin receptor per se is the target recognition structure for human NK cells, although a role in concert with other, as yet undefined molecules, cannot be excluded.","['Bridges, K R', 'Smith, B R']","['Bridges KR', 'Smith BR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HeLa Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/metabolism', 'Measles/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112089 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Sep;76(3):913-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI112089.,,,,PMC423953,,,,,,,

Because the antireceptor antibody and FeTF bind to different sites on the TF receptor molecule, it is possible to simultaneously and independently follow receptor and ligand. We have measured the relative amounts of transferrin or antireceptor antibody bound in the presence or absence of proteolytic enzymes using a cell sorter. At 4 degrees C almost all of the FL-TF and the FL-mAB is surface bound in a diffuse pattern. Within minutes of elevating the temperature to 37 degrees C surface aggregates form and the FL-TF is internalized. At this time about one sixth of the transferrin is still surface bound and accessible to papain digestion. The remainder localizes in a perinuclear cluster of vesicles. Monoclonal antibody binds to the cell surface transferrin receptor but is not internalized at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. When unlabeled diferric transferrin is added, it promotes the uptake of the Fl-mAB. The addition of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin also promotes FL-mAB uptake.

L., and Sassa, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5402-5406), but the mechanism of its uptake is unknown. We hypothesized the existence of a specific receptor for heme in the plasma membrane. Using [55Fe]heme, we examined the characteristics of its interaction with MEL cells at 4 degrees C. [55Fe]heme binding reached equilibrium within 4 h, was 80% dissociable by 16 h, and was independent of pH over the range 7.0-8.2. Specific heme binding was linear with cell number, and competitive binding studies with various heme analogues, such as free protoporphyrin IX, metal-substituted protoporphyrin IX, Fe-mesoporphyrin IX, and Fe-deuteroporphyrin IX, revealed significant stereospecificity for Fe-protoporphyrin IX. The dissociation constant of the interaction was 0.03 nM-1 with no evidence of cooperativity or multiple classes of sites. The average number of sites/cell was approximately 10,300. Reduction of binding following preincubation with trypsin, in conjunction with the above data, suggests that this cell type may display a receptor for heme which is comprised, as least in part, of protein.","['Galbraith, R A', 'Sassa, S', 'Kappas, A']","['Galbraith RA', 'Sassa S', 'Kappas A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '0 (heme receptor)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology']",1985/10/05 00:00,1985/10/05 00:01,['1985/10/05 00:00'],"['1985/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39008-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Oct 5;260(22):12198-202.,"['AM32890/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM33483/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ES01055/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for a protease which requires ATP hydrolysis but not ubiquitin.,11994-2000,"A soluble ATP-dependent system for protein degradation has been demonstrated in reticulocyte lysates, but not in extracts of nucleated cells. We report that extracts of undifferentiated murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells contain a labile ATP-stimulated proteolytic system. The addition of ATP to MEL cell extracts at alkaline pH enhances degradation of endogenous cell proteins and various radiolabeled exogenous polypeptides from 2-15-fold. Nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs had no effect. In reticulocytes, one role of ATP in proteolysis is for ubiquitin conjugation to protein substrates. MEL cells also contain ubiquitin and extracts can conjugate 125I-ubiquitin to cell proteins; however, this process in MEL cells seems unrelated to protein breakdown. After removal of ubiquitin from these extracts by DEAE- or gel chromatography, the stimulation of proteolysis by ATP was maintained and readdition of purified ubiquitin had no further effect. In addition, these extracts degraded in an ATP-dependent fashion casein whose amino groups were blocked and could not be conjugated to ubiquitin. After gel filtration or DEAE-chromatography of the MEL cell extracts (unlike those from reticulocytes), we isolated a high molecular weight (600,000) ATP-dependent proteolytic activity, which exhibits many of the properties of energy-dependent proteolysis seen in crude cell extracts. For example, both the protease and crude extracts are inhibited by hemin and N-ethylmaleimide and both hydrolyze casein, globin, and lysozyme rapidly and denatured albumin relatively slowly. The protease, like the crude extracts, is also stimulated by UTP, CTP, and GTP, although not as effectively as ATP. Also, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs and pyrophosphate do not stimulate the protease. Thus, some mammalian cells contain a cytosolic proteolytic pathway that appears independent of ubiquitin and involves and ATP-dependent protease, probably similar to that found in Escherichia coli or mitochondria.","['Waxman, L', 'Fagan, J M', 'Tanaka, K', 'Goldberg, A L']","['Waxman L', 'Fagan JM', 'Tanaka K', 'Goldberg AL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)', '25612-73-1 (Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Isoflurophate/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Reticulocytes/enzymology', 'Ubiquitins/*pharmacology']",1985/10/05 00:00,1985/10/05 00:01,['1985/10/05 00:00'],"['1985/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)38975-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Oct 5;260(22):11994-2000.,,,,,,,,,,,

The simultaneous expression of maturity and immaturity marker by tumor cells could explain also why such cells can be recognized as abnormal even in the absence of tumor specific antigens.","['Reizenstein, P', 'Ost, A', 'Skoog, L', 'Christensson, B', 'Biberfeld, P', 'Lagerlof, B']","['Reizenstein P', 'Ost A', 'Skoog L', 'Christensson B', 'Biberfeld P', 'Lagerlof B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Peroxidase/analysis']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1985 Jul-Aug;5(4):361-2.,,,,,,,,,,,

Although features such as nuclear morphology, number and nature of nucleoli, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio are useful criteria, the major morphologic features which distinguish ANLL cells from ALL cells are the presence of azurophilic granules and/or inclusions derived from fusion of these granules (Auer bodies). In most instances these can be visualized in the conventional blood film or bone marrow preparation. Sometimes, however, granules and Auer bodies are too small or too few to be seen with the light microscope. In such cases histochemical or ultrastructural studies will aid in proper classification.","['Altman, A J']",['Altman AJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/classification/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Peroxidase/analysis']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1985 Spring;7(1):21-44.,,82,,,,,,,,,

ATP depletion is a feature of the reaction to either hazard. Treatment of hepatocytes, however, with antimycin, oligomycin, sodium azide, or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide produced a rate and extent of ATP depletion comparable with anoxia without significant loss of viability. Treatment of P388D1 cells with 2-deoxyglucose plus antimycin, oligomycin, or sodium azide reproduced the loss of ATP accompanying silica particle intoxication. Again, there was no loss of viability. These data dissociate the loss of cellular ATP from the genesis of lethal injury in both cell types. ATP depletion was, however, associated with a loss of lysosomal integrity. With the metabolic inhibitors, loss of lysosomal integrity occurred in the absence of irreversible cell injury over the time course that anoxia and silica intoxication significantly damaged the cells. This implies that neither hazard produces lethal damage through mechanisms dependent on intracellular lysosomal enzyme release. While ATP depletion can cause lysosomal rupture in P388D1 macrophages, phagocytosis of silica particles in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ ions is associated with release of lysosomal contents without depletion of ATP or loss of cell integrity. Silica particles are concluded to interact directly with both the plasma and lysosomal membranes. The former leads to Ca2+ influx with resultant cell death and ATP depletion. The latter leads to release of lysosomal contents that is not followed by irreversible cell injury.","['Kane, A B', 'Petrovich, D R', 'Stern, R O', 'Farber, J L']","['Kane AB', 'Petrovich DR', 'Stern RO', 'Farber JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/ultrastructure', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Silicon Dioxide/*pharmacology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1985.249.3.C256 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1985 Sep;249(3 Pt 1):C256-66. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1985.249.3.C256.,"['AM-31114/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-03189/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-29524/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Some persons with AIDS have had evidence of HTLV-I infection. Unrelated to these findings, it has been suggested that HTLV-I is transmitted via blood products. We therefore evaluated the serologic status to the HTLV-I core antigen p24 of 48 persons with hemophilia (Hem A) receiving factor concentrate therapy (a group at risk for AIDS), 49 persons with beta-thalassemia major (Thal) receiving frozen packed red blood cells therapy (FPRC), 26 patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) receiving FPRC, and 18 persons not receiving any blood products. All participants were clinically well; only one had a risk factor other than hemophilia for AIDS, and all were from New York City, an area with a high incidence of AIDS. No Hem A or nontransfused persons had serum antibody to HTLV core p24 antigen; three with Thal and one with SCA were antibody-positive. These results were confirmed by both radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blot techniques. Positive serology did not correlate with any immune findings or quantity of blood products used. These data support that HTLV-I is preferentially transmitted through cellular blood products and that it is an infection for which cellular blood product recipients in at least some areas of the United States are at risk. Concentrate products appear free of transmission risk relative to cellular blood products, but we cannot be certain that this safety is absolute. The public health implications of blood product transmission of HTLV-I merit active, long-term investigation.","['Jason, J M', 'McDougal, J S', 'Cabradilla, C', 'Kalyanaraman, V S', 'Evatt, B L']","['Jason JM', 'McDougal JS', 'Cabradilla C', 'Kalyanaraman VS', 'Evatt BL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Humans', 'New York City', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830200205 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1985 Oct;20(2):129-37. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830200205.,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the similarities, and because of the uniform nomenclature for human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) viruses adopted at the first Cold Spring Harbor Meeting on HTLV (19, 79), this newly discovered virus associated with AIDS as HTLV-III was named HTLV-III. Other investigators making independent isolations of virus have suggested naming the virus lymphadenopathy virus or LAV (3, 16), immunodeficiency associated virus or IADV (48), AIDS-related virus (41). Immunological and nucleic acid comparison has now demonstrated that these viruses are, not surprisingly, very similar to HTLV-III (55, 63, 78). In view of the wide range of disease manifestations caused by the virus, and previous discussions concerning a uniform nomenclature for human T-lymphotropic retroviruses, it would seem ill-advised to restrict the name of this virus to one clinical manifestation of one disease. The frequent isolation of HTLV-III from patients with AIDS and ARC, the detection of antibodies specific for HTLV-III in nearly all patients with these diseases and in a high proportion of individuals at risk, and finally its effect on cells in vitro, leaves little doubt that HTLV-III is causatively involved in the development of these diseases. This etiologic association is further strengthened by the detection of HTLV-III infection in many instances where a direct cause-and-effect association can be made, e.g., hemophiliacs and children with AIDS, and blood from HTLV-III infected donors and the otherwise normal recipients of this blood who subsequently develop AIDS.","['Markham, P D', 'Shaw, G M', 'Salahuddin, S Z', 'Hahn, B', 'Sarngadharan, M G', 'Gallo, R C']","['Markham PD', 'Shaw GM', 'Salahuddin SZ', 'Hahn B', 'Sarngadharan MG', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology/microbiology/transmission', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Deltaretrovirus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/microbiology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Weight', 'Primates/microbiology', 'Syndrome', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-9430-7_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1985;187:13-34. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-9430-7_2.,,82,,,,,,,,,

The gP90gag-raf thus appears to be a glycosylated form of P75gag-raf specified by the gag sequences of the fusion protein, in analogy with Pr65gag and gPr80gag of murine leukemia viruses. Antiserum to the carboxyl-terminal P75gag-raf peptide was the most efficient in immunoprecipitation, and will be useful for detecting the product of the c-raf gene.","['Schultz, A M', 'Copeland, T D', 'Mark, G E', 'Rapp, U R', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Schultz AM', 'Copeland TD', 'Mark GE', 'Rapp UR', 'Oroszlan S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', 'Immune Sera', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/metabolism', 'Oncogenes', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Viral Fusion Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/immunology/metabolism']",1985/10/15 00:00,1985/10/15 00:01,['1985/10/15 00:00'],"['1985/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(85)90054-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1985 Oct 15;146(1):78-89. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(85)90054-6.,['N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Antibodies to the BLV antigens were of both the IgG and the IgM classes of immunoglobulins. The levels of antibodies of the IgM class were higher than those of IgG. There was a temporary decrease of reactive antibodies to the BLV antigens, to below detectable levels, during the 14-24 weeks post infection. A significant decrease in the level of plasma IgM was found in all BLV infected calves exhibiting lymphocytosis, while the level of IgG in the plasma of all experimental calves did not diverge significantly from the initial values, throughout the experiment.

Secretion is constitutive if proteins are secreted as fast as they are synthesized. In regulated secretion newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion are stored at high concentration in secretory vesicles until the cell receives an appropriate stimulus. When both constitutive and regulated protein secretion can take place in the same cell a mechanism must exist for sorting the correct secretory protein into the correct secretory vesicle. The secretory vesicle must then be delivered to the appropriate region of plasma membrane.

The N-terminal domain of the precursor gives rise to p19, a protein that interacts with the lipid envelope of the virus and that may also interact with viral RNA. The C terminus of p19 from the Prague C strain of Rous sarcoma virus was previously assigned to a tyrosine residue 175 amino acids from the N terminus. We have used metabolic labeling and carboxypeptidase digestion to show that the C terminus of p19 is actually tyrosine 155. This implies the existence of a sixth gag protein 22 amino acids in length and located between p19 and p10 on the gag precursor. The p19 species of some recombinant avian sarcoma viruses and of the defective endogenous virus derived from the ev-1 locus migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as if they were about 4,000 daltons smaller than p19.

Esterification of carboxyl groups completely suppressed the differences in migration of p19 and p19 beta.

In this report we extend these findings by showing that, with one exception, tumors containing provirus insertions in Mlvi-1 always contained provirus insertions in a second locus, Mlvi-2. To determine whether both events occurred in the same population of tumor cells, we examined the clonal nature of these tumors by taking advantage of allelic polymorphisms that occur naturally in both Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2. Tumors with provirus insertions in both Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2 arising in rats heterozygous at one of these loci were identified. DNA from these tumors was analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and hybridization to DNA probes derived from both Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2. Thus, we determined the clonal nature of three thymomas and showed that in these tumors both insertion events occurred in the same population of tumor cells. The concomitant appearance of provirus insertions in Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2 suggests a synergism of these two events that may be important in tumor induction and progression.","['Tsichlis, P N', 'Strauss, P G', 'Lohse, M A']","['Tsichlis PN', 'Strauss PG', 'Lohse MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Thymoma/genetics/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*microbiology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.56.1.258-267.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Oct;56(1):258-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.56.1.258-267.1985.,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC252516,,,,,,,

When HL-60 cells were incubated with the labeled endoperoxides (2a' and 3a') in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, no radioactivity was incorporated into either the cytosol or the chromatin fraction of the cells. When the radioactive endoperoxide (2a') was incubated in the culture medium for 3 days, with or without HL-60 cells, about 45% of the compound was similarly converted to 19,25-dihydroxy-6,19-dihydro-6,19-epoxyvitamin D3 (4a) and about 10% to 25-hydroxy-6,19-epoxyvitamin D3 (6a). These two new vitamin D derivatives were synthesized chemically and tested for their biological activities. Both compounds (4a and 6a) were about 2 times as active as 25-(OH)D3 endoperoxides (2a and 3a) and about 7 times as active as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1a) in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells. The differentiating activity of these compounds was well correlated with their activity in binding to the cytosol receptor for 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in HL-60 cells. The in vitro bone-resorbing activity of 25-hydroxy-6,19-epoxyvitamin D3 (6a) and 25-(OH)D3 endoperoxide (2a) was higher than that of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1a), indicating that the differentiating activity also paralleled the bone-resorbing activity in these vitamin D derivatives.

The potency of the endoperoxides derived from vitamin D derivatives possessing the 1 alpha-hydroxyl group such as 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 endoperoxides (2b and 2b') was markedly (10(-2)) diminished relative to the respective parent vitamin D compounds. In contrast, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 endoperoxides [25-(OH)D3 endoperoxides, 2a and 2a'] and their analogues fluorinated at the 24- or 26- and 27-positions were 2.5-10 times more potent than 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1a) in spite of the absence of the conjugated triene structure typical of vitamin D compounds. The potency of these vitamin D endoperoxides (2 and 2'), especially those lacking the 1 alpha-hydroxyl group, in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells was not correlated with their activity in binding to the cytosol receptor for 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1b). The binding efficiency to the receptor was relatively lower than the differentiating activity. To examine the action of vitamin D endoperoxides, carbon analogues of 25-(OH)D3 endoperoxides, two C-6 epimers of 25-hydroxy-6,19-dihydro-6,19-ethanovitamin D3 (6 and 6'), were synthesized.

K562 target cells when treated with highly purified human IL 1 for 1 hr bound greater numbers of LGL than untreated cells. LGL from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that bound few untreated K562 cells, attached to considerably increased numbers of IL 1-treated target cells. Cytotoxicity of LGL against target cells could similarly be increased by pulsing the latter cells with IL 1, and defective cytotoxicity of LGL from HCC patients could be corrected by treating the target K562 cells with IL 1. Lysis of PLC/PRF/5 cells, Yac-1 cells, and normal skin fibroblasts could also be increased by treatment with IL 1 for 1 hr. The enhanced binding and cytotoxicity of IL 1-treated target cells was only observed when the latter cells were preincubated with IL 1 at 37 degrees C, and was not evident at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, the IL 1-mediated effect could be abolished by treating the target cells with cycloheximide before the IL 1 pulse, or by adding rabbit anti-human IL 1 together with the IL 1. These results indicate that IL 1 affects a variety of target cells and increases their ability to bind and be lysed by enriched LGL. They demonstrate, furthermore, that defective natural cytotoxicity by the LGL of patients with advanced malignant disease can be corrected in vitro by treating the target cells with IL 1.","['Herman, J', 'Dinarello, C A', 'Kew, M C', 'Rabson, A R']","['Herman J', 'Dinarello CA', 'Kew MC', 'Rabson AR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*immunology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology/*therapy', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*immunology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Oct;135(4):2882-6.,,,,,,,,,,,

Synergistic action of phorbol ester and interleukin 2 in the induction of Tac antigen expression and interleukin 2 responsiveness in leukemic B cells.,2876-81,"Recent evidence indicates that interleukin 2 (IL 2), formerly thought to serve as growth factor exclusively for activated T cells, is directly involved in human B cell differentiation. We have investigated the role of IL 2 and IL 2 receptors (as defined by monoclonal anti-Tac antibody) in the phorbol ester-induced in vitro maturation of leukemic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Peripheral blood lymphocytes from B cells from CLL patients with high (greater than 10(5)/microliters) white blood cell counts were depleted of residual T lymphocytes and low-density cells (primarily macrophages) by consecutive steps of E rosetting, complement-mediated lysis of OKT3+ and OKT4+ cells, and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. No OKT3+ T cells were detectable in these cell populations before or after culture. When incubated for 3 days with phorbol ester plus recombinant human IL 2 (rIL 2), 12 to 57% of highly purified B cells from four of five tested patients expressed Tac antigen. Both phorbol ester and rIL 2 were required for maximal Tac antigen expression. Functional studies revealed that phorbol ester-activated (but not resting) CLL B cells responded to rIL 2 with [3H]thymidine incorporation and with enhanced secretion of IgM. Tac+ B cells were isolated in two cases on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. In one patient, stimulation of Tac+ B cells with rIL 2 resulted in enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation but no change in IgM secretion, as compared with Tac- B cells; in the second patient, stimulation of Tac+ B cells with rIL 2 did not result in [3H]thymidine uptake, but did result in significant IgM secretion. These findings indicate that certain leukemic B lymphocytes can be induced to express IL 2 receptors and respond to IL 2. The use of resting clonal B cell populations arrested at distinct stages of differentiation may help to better define the stage(s) at which IL 2 acts directly on B cells to induce proliferation and/or terminal differentiation.","['Kabelitz, D', 'Pfeffer, K', 'von Steldern, D', 'Bartmann, P', 'Brudler, O', 'Nerl, C', 'Wagner, H']","['Kabelitz D', 'Pfeffer K', 'von Steldern D', 'Bartmann P', 'Brudler O', 'Nerl C', 'Wagner H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Oct;135(4):2876-81.,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity peaked 6 days post-infection and required a 16-hr assay for maximal expression of cell lysis. Furthermore, a cell with cytotoxic characteristics of the spleen NK-like cell appeared at low levels in the circulation at 6 days post-vaccinia infection. NK-like cells from vaccinia-infected cats showed some cytotoxicity for FL74 targets in a 4-hr assay. The cat thus possesses at least two functionally different populations of naturally cytotoxic cells. NC-like cells are found in the spleen and peripheral blood, lyse virus-infected monolayer targets, and are not activated by infection.

Because various neuroendocrine factors are thought to influence immune responsiveness, we studied the effect of VIP on natural killer (NK) effector function. Human lymphocytes were incubated with 51Cr-labeled K562 target cells in a 4-hr cytotoxicity assay in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of VIP. As expected from its activation of adenylate cyclase, VIP was inhibitory at 10(-6) to 10(-10) M. Interestingly, however, when lymphocytes were preincubated with VIP for 30 or 60 min, then washed and added to target cells, a significant augmentation of NK activity ensued. Binding studies revealed that preincubation with VIP resulted in increased numbers of effector-target conjugates, whereas cytotoxic activity in agarose was not affected at the single cell level. Studies with synthetic analogs of VIP revealed that the integrity of the 14-28 C-terminal amino acid sequence was essential for its activity in cytotoxicity. These data strongly suggest a functional role for VIP in modulating immune responses during neuroendocrine interactions with the immune system.","['Rola-Pleszczynski, M', 'Bolduc, D', 'St-Pierre, S']","['Rola-Pleszczynski M', 'Bolduc D', 'St-Pierre S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*pharmacology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Oct;135(4):2569-73.,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood leukemic cells from 42 patients with ATL examined expressed IL-2 receptors that were detected by anti-Tac monoclonal antibody when examined immediately after the separation of cells or after the culture for 24 or 48 h. The number of anti-Tac binding sites ranged from 3,100 to 11,400 in fresh cells and from 3,600 to 96,000/cell in short-term cultured leukemic cells, whereas phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P)-stimulated normal T cells exhibited 6,900-35,000 anti-Tac binding sites per cell. ATL-derived and human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus, type I (HTLV-I)-infected cell lines such as MT-1 and Hut102 expressed a much higher number of anti-Tac binding sites. Leukemic cells from 15 patients with ATL examined showed no or very poor proliferative response to various concentrations of immunoaffinity-purified IL-2, although they expressed Tac antigen (Ag). Radiolabeled IL-2 binding experiments demonstrated that ATL leukemic cells could bind IL-2, and they expressed both high and low affinity IL-2 receptors, although the number of high affinity IL-2 receptor was much less than that of low affinity IL-2 receptor and that of anti-Tac binding sites. In contrast, leukemic T cells from a patient with T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in whom HTLV-I infection was not demonstrated, responded as well as PHA-P-stimulated normal T cells, and their IL-2 receptors, unlike ATL cells, were modulated (down regulated) by anti-Tac antibody. No differences were noted between ATL cells and normal activated T cells in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the IL-2 receptor. Thus, leukemic cells in ATL spontaneously and continuously express IL-2 receptor, which appears to be abnormally regulated and unresponsive to IL-2. These results, taken together with those on normal IL-2 receptors on HTLV-I-negative T-CLL cells, suggest that abnormal expression of the IL-2 receptor in ATL is closely associated with HTLV-I infection and may play a role in the neoplastic growth of ATL cells.","['Uchiyama, T', 'Hori, T', 'Tsudo, M', 'Wano, Y', 'Umadome, H', 'Tamori, S', 'Yodoi, J', 'Maeda, M', 'Sawami, H', 'Uchino, H']","['Uchiyama T', 'Hori T', 'Tsudo M', 'Wano Y', 'Umadome H', 'Tamori S', 'Yodoi J', 'Maeda M', 'Sawami H', 'Uchino H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (phytohemagglutinin-P)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Aug;76(2):446-53. doi: 10.1172/JCI111992.,,,,PMC423837,,,,,,,

Non-disruptive techniques for the introduction of (2'-5')(A)n and their analogues into cell lines or tissues are required for these studies since these highly charged compounds are cell impermeable. (2'-5')(A)n oligomers and analogues of increased stability towards phosphodiesterases were derived by chemical modification of their 2' end and encapsulated in protein-A-bearing liposomes. The specific delivery of liposome contents into L1210 mouse leukemic cells was achieved with the help of monoclonal antibodies directed against the appropriate class I major histocompatibility complex-encoded proteins expressed by these cells. This intracellular delivery led to transient inhibition of protein synthesis and an antiviral activity, both compatible with activation of RNase L. This activity was enhanced for the analogues designed to resist degradation, with respect to the natural product.","['Bayard, B', 'Leserman, L D', 'Bisbal, C', 'Lebleu, B']","['Bayard B', 'Leserman LD', 'Bisbal C', 'Lebleu B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', ""61172-40-5 (2',5'-oligoadenylate)"", 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antiviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Cell-Free System', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Oligoribonucleotides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Staphylococcal Protein A', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/drug effects']",1985/09/02 00:00,1985/09/02 00:01,['1985/09/02 00:00'],"['1985/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb09103.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1985 Sep 2;151(2):319-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb09103.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

A-MuLV-derived gag sequences could, however, functionally replace the 5' end of src and restore the transformation potential of a 5'-truncated src gene. To investigate this functional similarity, we replaced the gag sequence of an A-MuLV virus with the 5' end of src. This recombinant virus behaved like the A-MuLV virus from which it was derived: it transformed both fibroblasts and lymphoid cells in vitro.

In the present investigation, we extend these findings to demonstrate that monocyte-enhanced modulation is a phenomenon that occurs with a variety of T and B lymphoid antigens identified by murine monoclonal antibodies. Two patterns of monocyte-enhanced modulation were observed: (1) augmentation by monocytes of existing antigen modulation by the T101 and anti-Leu-4 antibodies, and (2) induction by monocytes of previously unrecognized modulation with the anti-Leu-2 and anti-Leu-9 antibodies. Enhancement of modulation by monocytes was also detected with antibodies to surface IgM and HLA-DR antigens. Antigen modulation on lymphoid cell lines appeared to be more variable than on fresh cells, with or without monocytes. Monocyte-enhanced antigen modulation was not demonstrated with two monoclonal antibodies against solid tumors. Monocyte-enhanced modulation was shown to be dependent upon the Fc portion of the antibody, but independent of proteolytic or oxidative compounds released by monocytes. These findings indicate that the results obtained during in vitro studies of antigen modulation may vary with the source of cells and the extent to which monocytic cells are present.

Since the fall of 1982, independent isolates of HTLV-III have been obtained in this laboratory, in collaboration with several clinical groups, from 101 AIDS and ARC patients and healthy donors at risk for AIDS. Most isolates were from peripheral blood T lymphocytes established in cell culture, but some were obtained from bone marrow, lymph node, brain tissue, and cell-free plasma and from cells associated with saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, and semen. Virus was isolated from approximately 50% of AIDS patients, 85% of ARC patients, and 30% of healthy individuals at risk for AIDS. The risk groups included homosexuals, promiscuous heterosexuals, i.v. drug users, recipients of blood or blood products, and spouses and offspring of AIDS patients and others at risk for AIDS. A high correlation was seen between persistent levels of serum antibody and the ability to isolate virus from patient or donor leukocytes. Immunologic and nucleic acid analysis demonstrated that the virus isolates were highly related, although substantial diversity was observed in the restriction enzyme cleavage patterns of those studied in detail. Biological analysis of cells from infected patients and donors as well as from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to virus in vitro demonstrated that OKT4/Leu3a+ (helper/inducer) lymphocytes were preferentially infected and were subjected to a characteristic cytopathic effect. The availability of multiple isolates of virus from a number of different patients and donors will greatly facilitate the characterization of HTLV-III and the study of possible biological and/or biochemical variants of the virus responsible for the development of AIDS, ARC, and related diseases.","['Salahuddin, S Z', 'Markham, P D', 'Popovic, M', 'Sarngadharan, M G', 'Orndorff, S', 'Fladagar, A', 'Patel, A', 'Gold, J', 'Gallo, R C']","['Salahuddin SZ', 'Markham PD', 'Popovic M', 'Sarngadharan MG', 'Orndorff S', 'Fladagar A', 'Patel A', 'Gold J', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology', '*Carrier State', 'Child', 'Deltaretrovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Hemophilia A/complications', 'Homosexuality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Retroviridae Infections/*microbiology', 'Risk', 'Sex', 'Sex Work', 'Transfusion Reaction']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.16.5530 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Aug;82(16):5530-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.16.5530.,,,,PMC391156,,,,,,,

Because human alveolar macrophages synthesize and secrete both a collagenase and CI that are immunologically and functionally identical to their counterparts in fibroblasts, we studied the production of such proteins by an immature human cell line (HL60) that can be induced to differentiate along monocytic or granulocytic pathways. The cells failed to synthesize collagenase under any culture condition tested. However, upon exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or phorbol esters (PMA), both of which promote monocytic differentiation of HL60, these cells synthesized and released CI in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the extent of CI expression was paralleled by the acquisition by such cells of the monocytic marker 63D3, indicating that inhibitor production and differentiation are closely correlated. This CI was immunologically and functionally identical to that produced by human macrophages and human skin fibroblasts. The quantity of CI synthesized by PMA-stimulated cells was 3- to 5-fold greater than produced by human alveolar macrophages, approximately equal to 1 microgram per 10(6) cells per day. In contrast, undifferentiated HL60 cells produced little or no detectable CI (less than or equal to 10-20 ng per 10(6) cells per day). Interestingly, when HL60 cells were stimulated to undergo granulocytic differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid, they also produced the ""monocytic"" CI.","['Bar-Shavit, Z', 'Teitelbaum, S L', 'Stricklin, G P', 'Eisen, A Z', 'Kahn, A J', 'Welgus, H G']","['Bar-Shavit Z', 'Teitelbaum SL', 'Stricklin GP', 'Eisen AZ', 'Kahn AJ', 'Welgus HG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Microbial Collagenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.16.5380 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Aug;82(16):5380-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.16.5380.,"['AM32788/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM34401/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DE05413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC390572,,,,,,,

After activation of MTX with N-hydroxysuccinimide, MTX was bound to the antibodies under conditions leading to maximum protein and antibody recovery. Although the coupling conditions for both antibodies were different, up to 13 molecules of MTX-antibody molecule could be attached with retention of antibody activity. Such conjugates were active in vitro and could inhibit the growth [( 3H]deoxyuridine uptake) of cells in culture. The conjugates were highly specific, having no effect on tumors lacking the antigen; however, MTX complexed to antibody was less potent than the free drug.

Although the virus-sensitive wild mice generally lack all or most of the xenotropic proviral genes characteristic of inbred strains, susceptibility to exogenous infection is unrelated to inheritance of these sequences. Instead, susceptibility is controlled by a single dominant gene, designated Sxv, which maps to chromosome 1. Sxv is closely linked to, but distinct from Bxv-1, the major locus for induction of xenotropic murine leukemia viruses in laboratory mice. Genetic experiments designed to characterize Sxv show that this gene also controls sensitivity to a wild mouse virus with the interference properties of mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia viruses, and that Sxv-mediated susceptibility to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses is restricted by the mink cell focus-forming virus resistance gene Rmcf. These data, together with genetic mapping of the mink cell focus-forming virus cell surface receptor locus to this same region of chromosome 1, suggest that Sxv may encode a wild mouse variant of the mink cell focus-forming virus receptor that allows penetration by xenotropic murine leukemia viruses.","['Kozak, C A']",['Kozak CA'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Genes, Dominant', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis', 'Virus Replication']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.55.3.690-695.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Sep;55(3):690-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.55.3.690-695.1985.,,,,PMC255045,,,,,,,

One of their possible sites of action is the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR). Combination of the structural features of these compounds led to the design and synthesis of the Schiff bases of N-hydroxy-N'-aminoguanidine. Synthesis and structure-activity studies of some of these compounds point to increased size and lipophilicity as important factors for activity. To optimize the activities of this series of compounds, 13 derivatives of high lipophilicity and molecular size have been synthesized and their biological activities studied. The most active anticancer compounds against L1210 in vitro (compounds 9 and 12) are about 7 times more active than hydroxyguanidine and hydroxyurea. The most active antiviral compounds against Rous sarcoma virus transformation of chick fibroblasts in vitro (7, 9) are about 40 times more active than hydroxyguanidine. One of the compounds (4) shows promising activity in vivo (% T/C = 140 against P388 leukemia in mice) and is undergoing further studies by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

These findings suggest that with TBEV, enhancement may be TBEV complex-specific rather than flavivirus-specific.

In addition, the usefulness of the present assay with taurocholate during the purification of the antigens was demonstrated. It is very likely that the present solid-phase radioimmunoassay using taurocholate will also be useful in determining other non-leukemia cell membrane antigens.","['Matsuzaki, H', 'Fukukawa, T', 'Seon, B K']","['Matsuzaki H', 'Fukukawa T', 'Seon BK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Detergents)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Detergents', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Radioimmunoassay/*methods', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine']",1985/07/16 00:00,1985/07/16 00:01,['1985/07/16 00:00'],"['1985/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(85)90121-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(85)90121-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1985 Jul 16;81(1):55-63. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(85)90121-8.,"['CA19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Regulation of transferrin receptors by phorbol diesters involves receptor internalization in association with increased receptor phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation). The intracellular mechanism of action of phorbol diester involves binding to and activation of the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Present studies comparing results obtained with whole cells and those from a cell-free system reconstituted from purified protein kinase C and transferrin receptor components have revealed that the transferrin receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase C activated by phorbol esters. Following tryptic digestion and two-dimensional separation of phosphopeptides of phosphorylated transferrin receptors, two major and several minor phosphoserine-containing fragments are resolved. These fragments are identical whether transferrin receptor is phosphorylated in whole cells incubated with phorbol diesters or following phosphorylation of affinity immobilized transferrin receptor in the in vitro reconstitution system. Phosphoamino acid analysis of these fragments indicates that serine is the only amino acid phosphorylated in whole cells or in the cell-free system. In addition, colchicine is shown to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner phorbol diester-induced internalization but not hyperphosphorylation of the surface transferrin receptor in whole cells. This inhibition is specific for colchicine since inactive beta- and gamma-Lumicolchicine have no such effect, while taxol reverses the inhibition. These results indicate that the phorbol diester-mediated process of down-regulation of the surface transferrin receptor is associated with phosphorylation of the receptor by activated protein kinase C and requires an intact cytoskeleton to affect receptor internalization.","['May, W S', 'Sahyoun, N', 'Jacobs, S', 'Wolf, M', 'Cuatrecasas, P']","['May WS', 'Sahyoun N', 'Jacobs S', 'Wolf M', 'Cuatrecasas P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1985/08/05 00:00,1985/08/05 00:01,['1985/08/05 00:00'],"['1985/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39383-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Aug 5;260(16):9419-26.,"['2P01 AM27157-07/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', '5P01 CA06973-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The human genome contains multiple dispersed nucleotide sequences related to the proto-oncogene mos and to proretroviral sequences in tight juxtaposition to each other. From sequencing appropriate cloned fragments of human DNA in phage and plasmid vectors it follows that one of these regions, NV-1, is a pseudogene of proto-mos with partial duplications and two Alu elements intervening its coding sequence, and the other, CL-1, seems to be also a mos-related gene with a deletion of the internal part of the structural gene. CL-1 is flanked by a proretroviral-like sequence including tRNAiMet binding site and U5 (part of the long terminal repeat). The proretroviral-like sequences are transcribed in 21-35S poly(A)+RNA abundant in normal and malignant human cells. Two hypotheses are proposed: endogenous retroviruses take part in amplification of at least some proto-oncogenes; proto-oncogenes are inactivated via insertion of movable genetic elements and conversion into pseudogenes. Potential oncogenicity of a normal human genome undergoes two controversial influences: it increases due to proto-oncogene amplification and decreases due to inactivation of some of them.","['Kisselev, L L', 'Chumakov, I M', 'Zabarovsky, E R', 'Prassolov, V S', 'Mett, V L', 'Berditchevsky, F B', ""Tret'yakov, L D""]","['Kisselev LL', 'Chumakov IM', 'Zabarovsky ER', 'Prassolov VS', 'Mett VL', 'Berditchevsky FB', ""Tret'yakov LD""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Placenta/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 1985;31(2):121-34.,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence and general distribution of these antigens and immune complexes in human sera was therefore of obvious interest. We now report an analysis of a total of 200 sera from 166 patients. Of these 113 sera were obtained from 84 patients with acute or chronic leukemias and 87 from 82 non-leukemic subjects, including laboratory workers and patients with non-leukemic neoplasias. Antigens and immune complexes were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The anti-SiSV gp70 antiserum used predominantly recognized the protein moieties of the glycoproteins. The distribution of SiSV gp70-related antigens and immune complexes was similar among leukemic and non-leukemic sera. The prevalence of SiSV gp70-related antigens was 53% and of SiSV gp70-related immune complexes 49% in all sera. SiSV gp70-related antigens were detected in a somewhat higher proportion of non-leukemic (69%) than leukemic sera (40%), whereas SiSV gp70-related immune complexes and cross-reactive antibodies were more evenly distributed in leukemic and non-leukemic sera (in 46 and 51% of leukemic and 54 and 51% of non-leukemic sera). Presence of antigens correlated with presence of SiSV gp70-related immune complexes in 71% of all sera, but in 13% of all sera antigens were detectable only by determining SiSV gp70-related immune complexes.

This report describes the binding of biologically-active 125I-labeled murine GM-CSF to a range of hemopoietic cells. Specific binding was restricted to murine cells and neither rat nor human bone marrow cells appeared to have surface receptors for 125I-labeled GM-CSF. 125I-Labeled GM-CSF only appeared to bind specifically to cells in the myelomonocytic lineage. The binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to both bone marrow cells and WEHI-3B(D+) was rapid (50% maximum binding was attained within 5 min at both 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C). Unlabeled GM-CSF was the only polypeptide hormone which completely inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to bone marrow cells, however, multi-CSF (also called IL-3) and G-CSF partially reduced the binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to bone marrow cells. Interestingly, the binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to a myelomonocytic cell line, WEHI-3B(D+), was inhibited by unlabeled GM-CSF but not by multi-CSF or G-CSF. Scatchard analysis of the binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to WEHI-3B(D+) cells, bone marrow cells and peritoneal neutrophils indicated that there were two classes of binding sites: one of high affinity (Kd1 = 20 pM) and one of low affinity (Kd2 = 0.8-1.2 nM). Multi-CSF only inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to the high affinity receptor on bone marrow cells: this inhibition appeared to be a result of down regulation or modification of the GM-CSF receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Walker, F', 'Burgess, A W']","['Walker F', 'Burgess AW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Reference Values']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1985 Apr;4(4):933-9.,,,,PMC554282,,,,,,,

Basal activities in both lymphoma lines were 3-4-fold greater than in mouse L1210 leukaemia cells. However, total endogenous poly (ADP-R) polymerase activity in both L5178Y cell lines, stimulated by a large excess of DNase in the presence of Triton X-100, was less than half the activity in L1210 cells. Doses of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) that produced 20-50% survival of colony-forming units increased poly (ADP-R) in both lymphoma lines by only 25% compared with 377% in L1210 cells when synthesis was measured immediately after a 30-min exposure of MNU. During the first 24 h after MNU AII cells produced a peak of activity that was not seen with LS cells. A second peak was seen in both cell lines between 24 and 48 h following MNU. Concentrations of 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) above 2.5 mM inhibited colony-forming ability of lymphoma cells and equally inhibited uptake of [14C]formate into protein, RNA and DNA indicating that 3AB behaves as a general metabolic poison. Concentrations of 3AB in the toxic range of 3-10 mM inhibited poly (ADP-R) synthesis but no degradation of the polymer was observed. Non-toxic concentrations of 3AB potentiated cell killing by MNU to a similar degree in both lymphoma cell lines.

Heteroduplexes of HTLV-I and HTLV-II demonstrated a significant amount of sequence homology, with the strongest region of conservation occurring in the 3'-most coding sequences, designated pX, and to a lesser, although substantial extent in the rest of the genome. Thus, the genomic organization of HTLV-II appears to be very similar to that of HTLV-I. All HTLV-III molecular clones appeared to be identical, with a single exception, which showed heterogeneity in the env gene region. In heteroduplexes between HTLV-I and HTLV-III, very little homology was observed, being confined to the gap/pol region.

Two of the three members in this family have been linked etiologically to human diseases: HTLV-I with adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-III with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In addition to their T-cell tropism and a number of other common biological and biochemical properties, the most unique common features of these viruses from a molecular biological point of view are the presence of the x-lor gene towards the 3' end of the genome and the phenomenon of a virus-induced trans-acting factor in activation of transcription initiated in the viral long terminal repeat. These features may not only be key in understanding the mechanism of transformation or cell killing by these viruses, but they also provide a basis for new classification of retroviruses. In spite of these similarities among HTLV-I, -II, -III, and bovine leukemia virus, the genome of HTLV-III is only distantly related to these other viruses. Instead, it shows greater homology to members of the Lentivirus family. Therefore, all these viruses may have a common progenitor. Two other salient features arose from the analyses of HTLV-III and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. (a) HTLV-III frequently infects the brain of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients who suffer from central nervous system disorders. This not only identifies HTLV-III as the direct candidate in these central nervous system disorders but also poses the problem of crossing the blood-brain barrier in therapy strategies to eradicate the virus. (b) Different HTLV-III isolates comprise a spectrum of related viruses, with the degree of divergence varying from virtual identity to 10-15% difference. The most divergent region resides in the envelope gene. Whether this finding has implications in the development of an effective vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome remains to be determined.","['Wong-Staal, F', 'Ratner, L', 'Shaw, G', 'Hahn, B', 'Harper, M', 'Franchini, G', 'Gallo, R']","['Wong-Staal F', 'Ratner L', 'Shaw G', 'Hahn B', 'Harper M', 'Franchini G', 'Gallo R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/microbiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Sep;45(9 Suppl):4539s-4544s.,,52,,,,,,,,,

Similarly HTLV-I which is T4 tropic is associated with an increased risk for development of infectious disease in regions where the virus is endemic. Since HTLV-I is also believed to be transmitted by blood and by sexual intercourse we considered the possibility that a variant form of HTLV might cause AIDS. The identification of cross-reactive antibodies to HTLV-I-MA in a third or more of the AIDS patients and in suspicious blood donors that donated to transfusion-associated cases of AIDS eventually led to the recognition of HTLV-III, the causative agent of AIDS. The protein most associated with lymphocyte immortalization or transformation in the case of HTLV-I is p42. The proteins of HTLV-I encoded by the amino terminus of the env gene designated gp61 and gp45 are the most immunogenic antigens of this virus. Similarly those encoded by the amino terminus of the env gene HTLV-III designated gp160 and gp120 appear to be the most immunogenic markers for this agent. Almost all AIDS patients, ARC patients, and asymptomatic hemophiliacs have detectable antibodies to gp120 and gp160. HTLV-III related agents designated STLV-III have been found in macaque monkeys that develop simian AIDS and high prevalence rates of antibodies to STLV-III can be found in healthy African green monkeys. We hypothesize that the STLV-III of African green monkeys could represent a recent source of the virus to have infected humans in central Africa where the human epidemic probably began. The recognition that up to one million people may already be infected with HTLV-III in the United States alone indicates the need for development of a vaccine. The availability of primate species infected with the serologically related STLV-III agents that either resist disease development (African green monkeys) or succumb to an AIDS-type syndrome (rhesus) provide models that should aid in our attempts to develop such vaccines.","['Essex, M', 'McLane, M F', 'Kanki, P', 'Allan, J', 'Kitchen, L', 'Lee, T H']","['Essex M', 'McLane MF', 'Kanki P', 'Allan J', 'Kitchen L', 'Lee TH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*microbiology/transmission', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cat Diseases/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Deltaretrovirus/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Hemophilia A/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/microbiology/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Monkey Diseases/immunology/microbiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/microbiology/veterinary', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/physiology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Sep;45(9 Suppl):4534s-4538s.,"['5T32RR07000/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",57,,,,,,,,,

Picolinic acid inhibited both iron uptake and cell growth. Furthermore, picolinic acid was shown to markedly decrease the level of ferritin in the cells. In spite of the inhibition of cell growth, picolinic acid induced a marked increase in the transferrin-binding capacity of the cells. This phenomenon was due to a two-five-fold enhancement of the rate of transferrin receptor biosynthesis. Other iron-chelating compounds, capable of reducing the level of intracellular iron, also elicited a marked enhancement of the transferrin-binding capacity of the cells. However, the addition of iron, as ferric ammonium citrate, in the culture medium elicited a marked increase in the level of ferritin and a strong decrease in the transferrin-binding capacity of the cells. On the basis of these data we propose that a feed-back mechanism is involved in the regulation of transferrin receptors: when the cells accumulate iron they decrease the number of transferrin receptors in order to prevent further accumulation of iron; when no or low iron is available to the cells, the number of transferrin receptors markedly increases as a compensatory mechanism.","['Testa, U', 'Louache, F', 'Titeux, M', 'Thomopoulos, P', 'Rochant, H']","['Testa U', 'Louache F', 'Titeux M', 'Thomopoulos P', 'Rochant H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Picolinic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'QZV2W997JQ (picolinic acid)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ferritins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Picolinic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Time Factors']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07446.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Jul;60(3):491-502. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07446.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore this relationship further, we studied the intercalating agent ethidium bromide and found that it blocked epipodophyllotoxin-induced DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II in vitro as well as in vivo. Using an in vitro assay consisting of purified calf thymus DNA topoisomerase II, end-labeled DNA, and the epipodophyllotoxin teniposide, we found that ethidium bromide markedly interfered with the enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. Furthermore, ethidium bromide also blocked the formation of DNA single- and double-strand breaks in mouse L1210 cells when exposed to the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide. This effect cannot be explained by alterations in drug accumulation since steady-state drug concentrations were unchanged, and the effect was also observed in isolated nuclei. In addition to its effects on epipodophyllotoxin-mediated DNA breakage, ethidium bromide also potently inhibited the cytotoxic effects of etoposide but only when present during drug treatment.

These aggregates are distinguishable from fibrous long-spacing collagen (in vitro and at biopsy) and the Luse body. The aggregates are produced from dermal collagen fibrils by clostridial collagenase and culture-medium extract, which supposedly contains cellular collagenase at a neutral pH, as well as by organ cultures. In vitro experiments showed that carrageenan granuloma contains fibrous long-spacing collagen and segment long-spacing collagen. The granuloma also contains the aggregates. The aggregates were found in skin biopsies from syphilitic chancres, acrosclerotic scleroderma, morphea, mycosis fungoides, myeloid leukemia, mastocytosis and malignant melanoma. These findings indicate that the aggregates are products of the in situ degradation of collagen fibrils by some collagenolytic factor.

The enzyme HphI has been shown to recognize a single nucleotide change at the 5' end of beta-IVS 2, and, using restriction enzyme analysis, demonstrated for the first time a specific defect associated with beta(0)-thalassemia. Cloning and sequencing of a beta-thalassemia gene have identified a single base change within IVS 2 at a position 705 nucleotides from the 5' end of IVS 2 that results in a beta(0)-thalassemia phenotype; no normal splicing occurs in this gene despite the fact that both the 5' and 3' ends of IVS 2 are unchanged. A unique and strong cryptic 3' acceptor splice site present in the normal gene at a position 580 nucleotides from the 5' end is used extensively in the mutant gene. Studies of this gene have indicated that there are sequences within IVS that are responsible for optimal expression of this gene; changes in these sequences can lead to markedly abnormal patterns of splicing. In addition, beta-globin gene expression has been evaluated in human erythroleukemia cells, K562 cells, and, although stable transformants with integrated beta-globin genes have been obtained, none of these transformants expressed the added beta-globin genes. This is presumably due to trans-acting factors or distal cis-acting effects that suppress the expression of these added beta-globin genes. In addition, a low epsilon-producing cell line, Bos cells, was used as a recipient for an exogenous epsilon-globin gene. A neomycin resistance gene was cotransfected into these cells, and a neomycin analogue (G418) was used to select cells containing both the neomycin resistance and epsilon-globin genes. Using Southern blotting, 10 of 11 stably transformed G418-resistant lines, which contain intact epsilon-globin genes, express epsilon-globin mRNA at much higher levels than the Bos cells into which they were transfected. Two of these lines express the epsilon-globin genes at a level comparable to that of wild-type K562 cells. These results indicate that the transfer and expression of human globin genes in human erythroid cells is feasible, and can occur at a high level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bank, A', 'Dobkin, C', 'Donovan-Peluso, M', 'Young, K']","['Bank A', 'Dobkin C', 'Donovan-Peluso M', 'Young K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Thalassemia/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb17169.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1985;445:1-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb17169.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of malignant transformation by HTLV is unknown but appears to be distinct from that of other classes of retroviruses, which induce malignant transformation through viral or cellular oncogenes. Recently a new gene, termed x, was identified in HTLV. This gene has been hypothesized to be the transforming gene of HTLV because of its conservation within the HTLV class of retroviruses. By in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-II x gene, it is now demonstrated that the presence of a functional x gene product is necessary for efficient HTLV transcription. Therefore, these studies provide direct evidence for an important function of the x gene in HTLV replication.

Subsequent seroepidemiological studies have shown the presence of HTLV-III-specific antibodies in the serum of most patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC), and in the serum of many individuals at risk for AIDS. Despite these extensive studies, there are no reports of protective effects of HTLV-III antibodies. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies specific for HTLV-I and -II have been identified previously. Therefore, we investigated whether HTLV-III-exposed individuals possess antibody activities capable of inhibiting viral infection. Here, we report that natural antibodies capable of neutralizing HTLV-III infection of H9 cells were detected in most adults AIDS and ARC patients but in no normal healthy heterosexual controls. Geometric mean antibody titres in ARC patients were double those in AIDS patients, and were even higher in two antibody-positive healthy homosexuals. This suggests that virus neutralizing antibodies may exert an in vivo protective effect.

The finding that a small region of chromosome 9 which includes the c-abl oncogene is translocated to chromosome 22 prompted studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in this disease. We have demonstrated previously that the chromosome 9 of one patient with CML contains a breakpoint 14 kilobases (kb) 5' of the most 5' v-abl-homologous exon. These data suggest a role for c-abl in CML, a theory supported by the presence of an abnormally sized abl messenger RNA and protein in the CML cell line K562. The region involved in the translocation on chromosome 22 has also been identified: all Ph'-positive patients examined to date have a breakpoint within a 5.8-kb region, for which we have proposed the name 'breakpoint cluster region' (bcr). To determine whether bcr contains protein-encoding regions, probes from bcr were tested for their ability to hybridize to complementary DNA sequences. A 0.6-kb HindIII/BamHI bcr restriction enzyme fragment proved suitable for isolating several cDNA clones from a human fibroblast cDNA library. Using bcr cDNA sequences, we obtained data strongly suggesting the presence of a chimaeric bcr/abl mRNA in the leukaemic cells of Ph'-positive CML patients. The recent isolation of cDNA clones containing bcr and abl sequences confirms this finding. Because the bcr part of the chimaeric mRNA could be required to induce the transforming activity of the human c-abl oncogene, we have now initiated studies to characterize the normal 'bcr gene' and to determine the effect of a translocation within its coding domain. We demonstrate that as a result of the Ph' translocation, a variable number of bcr exons are included in the chimaeric bcr/abl mRNA. The bcr gene sequences in this mRNA could be responsible for the transition of the abl cellular proto-oncogene into an oncogene.","['Heisterkamp, N', 'Stam, K', 'Groffen, J', 'de Klein, A', 'Grosveld, G']","['Heisterkamp N', 'Stam K', 'Groffen J', 'de Klein A', 'Grosveld G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1985/06/03 00:00,1985/06/03 00:01,['1985/06/03 00:00'],"['1985/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/315758a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Jun 27-Jul 3;315(6022):758-61. doi: 10.1038/315758a0.,,,,,['GENBANK/X02596'],,,,,,

Studies carried out to delineate the global distribution of the virus have demonstrated natural antibodies to HTLV-I in the serum of healthy donors from specific geographical areas, and have defined viral endemic areas in Japan, the Caribbean basin, Africa and the southeastern United States. Such studies have suggested that the prevalence of HTLV-I antibodies is directly correlated with age, is associated with the clinical syndrome of adult T-cell lymphoma, and is associated with transmission from mother to child. A separate subtype of the human retrovirus, HTLV-II (refs 21, 22), has also been identified. The population of Israel in part comprises groups of immigrants of various ethnic and geographical origins. Because of this, and the fact that Israel has a highly developed public health system, we surmised that the ethnic groups in Israel could be used in a seroepidemiological survey of HTLV infection. The serological survey reported here demonstrates a high prevalence of HTLV-I antibodies in new immigrants from Ethiopia. This previously ethnically and geographically isolated group, the 'Black Jews' or 'Falashas', from the Gondar region in the northern rural highlands of Ethiopia, has the highest endemic rate of HTLV-I yet reported outside Japan.","['Ben-Ishai, Z', 'Haas, M', 'Triglia, D', 'Lee, V', 'Nahmias, J', 'Bar-Shany, S', 'Jensen, F C']","['Ben-Ishai Z', 'Haas M', 'Triglia D', 'Lee V', 'Nahmias J', 'Bar-Shany S', 'Jensen FC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Africa, Northern/ethnology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Ethiopia/ethnology', '*Ethnicity', 'Europe/ethnology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Serology']",1985/06/20 00:00,1985/06/20 00:01,['1985/06/20 00:00'],"['1985/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/315665a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Jun 20-26;315(6021):665-6. doi: 10.1038/315665a0.,,,,,,,,,,,

A causal relationship between hypermethylation and gene inactivity has been established for retroviral genomes which are methylated de novo when inserted into the germ line of mice (ref. 5; for review, see ref. 6). The mutual interaction of the provirus with the host genome can influence virus expression and can result in inactivation of the host gene by insertional mutagenesis. We report here that the insertion of a provirus can change the methylation pattern of the host DNA. Sequences flanking the provirus become methylated de novo within 1 kilobase (kb) of the integration site. In Mov-13 mice, which carry a lethal mutation of the alpha 1(I) collagen gene, de novo methylation of host DNA is associated with a change in chromatin conformation. This suggests that virus-induced DNA methylation can alter DNA-protein interactions and thereby interfere with correct gene activation during embryonic development.","['Jahner, D', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Jahner D', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Col1a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1985/06/13 00:00,1985/06/13 00:01,['1985/06/13 00:00'],"['1985/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/315594a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Jun 13-19;315(6020):594-7. doi: 10.1038/315594a0.,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are very similar to the murine and human c-myc genes (ca. 90% identity). The entire c-myc coding sequence is represented in feline v-myc and replaces portions of the gag and env genes and the entire pol gene. The coding sequence is in phase with the gag gene reading frame; v-myc, therefore, appears to be expressed as a gag-myc fusion protein. Viral sequences at the 3' myc-FeLV junction begin with the hexanucleotide CTCCTC, which is also found at the 3' fes-FeLV junction of both Gardner-Arnstein and Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma viruses. These similarities suggest that some sequence specificity may exist for the transduction of cellular genes by FeLV. Feline v-myc lacks a potential phosphorylation site at amino acid 343 in the putative DNA-binding domain, whereas both human and murine c-myc have such sites.

However, the exact role(s) the accessory cells play in such a response has not been clearly defined. We have evaluated the role of Ia and the requirement for interleukin 1 (IL 1) in periodate mitogenicity by using the Ia+ cloned tumor cell lines P388AD (Ia+, IL 1 inducible) and P388NA (Ia+, IL 1 noninducible) as accessory cells. P388AD but not P388NA was able to supply accessory cell function to periodate-treated T cells, suggesting that Ia expression alone was not sufficient to reconstitute a response. Monoclonal anti-I-Ad and anti-I-Ed antibody blocked the accessory cell function of P388AD. In addition, monoclonal antibody GK 1.5, directed against the T cell determinant L3T4a, blocked the P388AD/periodate-treated T cell interaction, confirming that this interaction was restricted by class II molecules. Although Ia expression was required, the response was not major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted, because allogeneic as well as syngeneic macrophages were capable of supplying accessory cell function to periodate-treated T cells. Exogenous IL 1 alone was able to trigger periodate-treated T cells, suggesting that Ia was required for the induction of IL 1 synthesis by the accessory cells. Furthermore, purified IL 2, devoid of IL 1 activity, was able to fully reconstitute the proliferative response of accessory cell-depleted oxidized T cells to a level equal to that of whole spleen accessory cells or P388AD. These data suggest that periodate-treated T cells can proliferate with IL 1 alone and that Ia+ accessory cells in periodate-mediated T cell mitogenicity may function in the release of IL 1 and the induction of IL 2 synthesis by the T cells.","['Smith, L A', 'Cohen, D A', 'Lachman, L B', 'Kaplan, A M']","['Smith LA', 'Cohen DA', 'Lachman LB', 'Kaplan AM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '10450-60-9 (Periodic Acid)', 'B45A1BUM4Q (metaperiodate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Periodic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Aug;135(2):1137-44.,"['CA 34052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The COOH terminus of the alpha subunit was found to be immediately adjacent to the NH2 terminus of the pp32 pol protein. COOH-terminal amino acid analysis of pp32 revealed that this protein is also processed. From the deduced amino acid sequence of pol, it appears likely that pol encodes an additional 4100-dalton polypeptide located at its extreme COOH terminus.

This fusion protein contains 80 amino acids of SV40 small t and the 403 amino acid protein kinase domain of v-abl. We report here the purification and characterization of this kinase. The purified material contains two proteins (Mr = 59,800 and 57,200), both of which possess sequences derived from v-abl. Overall purification was 3,750-fold, with a 31% yield, such that 117 micrograms of kinase could be obtained from 40 g of E. coli within 6-7 days. The specific kinase activity is over 170 mumol of phosphate min-1 mumol-1, comparable to the most active protein-serine kinases. Kinase activity is insensitive to K+, Na+, Ca2+, Ca2+-calmodulin, cAMP, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. The Km for ATP is dependent on the concentration of the second substrate. GTP can also be used as a phosphate donor. The enzyme can phosphorylate peptides consisting of as few as two amino acids and, at a very low rate, free tyrosine. Incubation of the kinase with [gamma-32P]ATP results in incorporation of 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. This reaction, however, cannot be blocked by prior incubation with unlabeled ATP. Incubation of 32P-labeled kinase with either ADP or ATP results in the synthesis of [32P]ATP.

Among Japanese from HTLV-I-endemic areas and exposed to the virus as indicated by the presence of antibodies to disrupted HTLV-I, 93% of adult T-cell leukemia patients were also seropositive for HA-gp52 compared to only 16% of healthy individuals. Differing sensitivities in the methods of assaying antibodies to HTLV and HA-gp52 were not responsible for these observations as shown by the lack of correlation of HTLV-I antibody titer with the presence of antibody to HA-gp52. Among adult T-cell leukemia patients, antibody titers to HTLV-I and HA-gp52 also varied independently. These results indicate that HA-gp52 in humans is antigenic and correlated with disease.

The percentages of cells with surface and intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin M (IgM) and erythrocyte-antibody-rosetting cells agreed closely in all infected cattle. This correlation and the results of double labeling experiments indicate that virtually all the surface IgM-positive B-lymphocytes in the blood of these animals carry Fc receptors. In PL cattle, the percentages of surface IgM-positive cells were more than twice those of normal cells and accounted for all the increase in peripheral blood lymphocytes. B-cells accounted for most of the increase in peripheral blood lymphocytes seen in cattle with PL. In contrast, most BLV-infected, nonlymphocytotic cattle had normal percentages of B-cells. Thus, the expansion of the B-cell population in blood, while being a conspicuous characteristic of PL, is not necessarily a consequence of BLV infection per se. Comparisons of the percentages of IgM-positive and erythrocyte-antibody complement-rosetting cells, together with the results of double labeling experiments, indicate that about one-half the B-cells in the blood of cattle with PL lacked C-3 receptors. The proportion of these cells (most likely immature B-lymphocytes) was smaller in the blood of BLV-infected nonlymphocytotic cattle. Direct comparison showed that, in BLV-infected cattle with or without PL, and in BLV-free cattle, virtually all erythrocyte-rosetting blood cells had peanut agglutinin receptors. With only one exception, the numbers of erythrocyte-positive cells in the blood of BLV-infected cattle with or without PL were within normal values. The ""null"" blood cell population, estimated as the difference between the IgM-positive and erythrocyte-positive populations, was essentially unaffected in BLV-infected cattle without PL, but it was absent in PL cattle. The large majority of the B-lymphocytes present in the blood of cattle with PL were infected with BLV. The proportion of infected B-lymphocytes in the blood of BLV-positive nonlymphocytotic cattle was much lower. Even in cattle with low or moderate levels of BLV-infected blood lymphocytes, the percentages of these cells were remarkably constant during the 12-month period of the study.

Growth inhibition, acquisition of immunoglobulin Fc receptors, increased expression of monocyte-related surface antigens, and an increase in lysosomal enzyme contents accompany maturation induced by gamma-interferon and other cytokine factors tested. Additionally, increased receptors for chemotactic peptide (fMLPR), increased hydrogen peroxide release in response to phorbol myristic acetate stimulation, and the release of prostaglandins (PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1a) follow exposure to lymphokine and cell line sources of myeloid colony-stimulating activity (CSA).

The 2-day phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphokine contained no detectable CSA and was a good source of differentiation activity. A simple, rapid assay for a new human CSA with pluripotent hematopoietic stimulating activity (pluripoietin) is described based on stimulation of [3H]glucosamine incorporation. Cell line conditioned media containing pluripoietin, purified pluripoietin, and gamma-IFN are active in this assay.

A T-cell line was established in culture from her peripheral blood. The presence of HTLV-I in the cultured T-cell line was established by the detection of expressed viral specific gag protein p-19 and proviral DNA. Thus, a B-cell lymphoid malignancy can occur in the presence of HTLV-I infected T-cells, suggesting the possibility of an indirect leukemogenic mechanism.","['Clark, J W', 'Hahn, B H', 'Mann, D L', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Popovic, M', 'Richardson, E', 'Strong, D M', 'Lofters, W S', 'Blattner, W A', 'Gibbs, W N']","['Clark JW', 'Hahn BH', 'Mann DL', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Popovic M', 'Richardson E', 'Strong DM', 'Lofters WS', 'Blattner WA', 'Gibbs WN', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'DNA, Viral/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/analysis', 'Jamaica', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850801)56:3<495::aid-cncr2820560314>3.0.co;2-h [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 Aug 1;56(3):495-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850801)56:3<495::aid-cncr2820560314>3.0.co;2-h.,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were from the Nagasaki district, which is one of the most endemic areas of ATL in Japan. Pre-ATL is a subclinical T cell abnormality differing from ATL. It is characterized by an insidious onset and appearance of abnormal T lymphocytes (10% to 40%) in the peripheral blood without clinical symptoms except for a few cases transiently presenting fever, skin eruptions, and slight lymphadenopathies. Most abnormal T lymphocytes were small and mature with incised or lobulated nuclei and formed E rosettes with sheep RBCs. Virologic and biomolecular analysis revealed that all cases were infected with HTLV, and proviral DNA was integrated in host lymphocytes from 12 of the 14 cases examined. Furthermore, the lymphocyte populations, including abnormal T lymphocytes, were monoclonal with respect to the site of the provirus integration. Abnormal T lymphocytosis persisted from one to more than seven years in six cases, three of which developed ATL after a one- to five-year pre-ATL stage, whereas abnormal T lymphocytes spontaneously decreased in the other seven patients. However, HTLV-infected monoclonal lymphocytes were detected in four cases examined, even after most of the abnormal T lymphocytes had disappeared. Moreover, the same clonally provirus-integrated lymphocytes persisted in two of four cases not only during the course of abnormal lymphocytosis, but also in the subsequent almost-normal blood. These results indicate that the majority of the cases were in a pre-ATL state with a potential to develop ATL.","['Kinoshita, K', 'Amagasaki, T', 'Ikeda, S', 'Suzuyama, J', 'Toriya, K', 'Nishino, K', 'Tagawa, M', 'Ichimaru, M', 'Kamihira, S', 'Yamada, Y']","['Kinoshita K', 'Amagasaki T', 'Ikeda S', 'Suzuyama J', 'Toriya K', 'Nishino K', 'Tagawa M', 'Ichimaru M', 'Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', '*Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology/*pathology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82511-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Jul;66(1):120-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

The decrease was almost complete within 30s after the PHA addition. This decrease was followed by an increase in the 32P-labelling of phosphatidic acid (maximally 2.8-fold at 2 min). The stimulation of myo-[2-3H]inositol-prelabelled JURKAT cells by PHA induced an accumulation of [2-3H]inositol trisphosphate in the presence of 5 mM-LiCl.

C14-labeled fatty acids were incubated with 10,000 X g supernatant of homogenate of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells in the presence of Ca++ at 37 degrees C. 5,11,14-Eicosatrienoic acid was not converted by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and 5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid was mainly converted to 5-hydroxy-6,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid (5-HETE). This monohydroxy was identified by UV spectrometry (UV max 235 nm) and GC-mass spectrometry. Incubations with whole homogenate analyzed by HPLC and bioassay showed that no detectable LTC, LTD or LTE was formed.

The rates of nucleotide substitution in the v-mos and gag genes are very high and are similar to those of RNA viral genes such as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes in the influenza A virus. Thus, oncogenes seem to exemplify a general feature of genome evolution: the rate of evolution of RNA genomes can be more than a million times greater than that of DNA genomes because of a high mutation rate in the RNA genome.","['Gojobori, T', 'Yokoyama, S']","['Gojobori T', 'Yokoyama S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Gene Products, gag', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.12.4198 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jun;82(12):4198-201. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.12.4198.,"['GM-20293/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-28672/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH-31302/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC397963,,,,,,,

RS-1 cells, transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, contain high levels of pp60src; LSTRA cells, transformed by Moloney murine leukemia virus, contain a tyrosine kinase (pp56) that is the product of an unknown cellular gene. Rates of phosphorylation of peptide tyrosine were elevated more than 20-fold in RS-1 and LSTRA particulate fractions compared to fractions from suitable control cells (N2 and YAC-1), but there was not a proportional increase in rates of phosphorylation of PtdIns, PtdIns4P, or diacylglycerol. Heat (34 degrees C) completely inactivated the LSTRA tyrosine kinase, while it enhanced the phosphorylation of PtdIns and PtdIns4P and had no effect on the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol. PtdIns4P inhibited the phosphorylation of PtdIns but had no effect on tyrosine kinase activity. An antibody, raised against a peptide with a sequence homologous to the autophosphorylation site of pp60src, immunoprecipitated tyrosine kinase activity from RS-1 and LSTRA extracts but had no effect on PtdIns kinase or PtdIns4P kinase activity. These results provide evidence that the phosphorylations of tyrosine and PtdIns are catalyzed by different proteins. An additional observation was that a monoclonal antibody that binds to pp60src and pp56 removed PtdIns kinase as well as tyrosine kinase activity from RS-1 and LSTRA particulate extracts. This antibody also removed PtdIns kinase from N2 and YAC-1 extracts, in which tyrosine kinase activity was low or undetectable. Thus, the anti-pp60src monoclonal antibody may recognize the PtdIns kinase in addition to pp60src and pp56.","['MacDonald, M L', 'Kuenzel, E A', 'Glomset, J A', 'Krebs, E G']","['MacDonald ML', 'Kuenzel EA', 'Glomset JA', 'Krebs EG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.67 (1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Substrate Specificity']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.12.3993 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jun;82(12):3993-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.12.3993.,"['HL07028/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC397920,,,,,,,

Fr-MuLV disease is divided into two stages based on the ability of the leukemia cells to grow in culture and transplant into syngeneic mice. Hematopoietic cells taken from the early stage of disease after Fr-MuLV infection grow as immortal myeloid cell lines in the presence of WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium (CM) or interleukin 3. These growth factor-dependent cell lines do not grow in culture in the absence of CM and do not form tumors in syngeneic animals. If these Fr-MuLV-infected cells are superinfected with Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MuLV), they lose their dependence on WEHI-3 CM and proliferate in culture in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Concomitant with the loss of growth factor dependence in culture, the Ab-MuLV-infected cell lines become tumorigenic in syngeneic mice. This secondary level of transformation is Ab-MuLV specific. Fr-MuLV-immortalized myeloid cell lines superinfected with Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) or amphotropic virus remain dependent on WEHI-3 CM for growth in vitro and are not tumorigenic in vivo. Neither Ab-MuLV- nor Ha-MuSV-infected normal mouse myeloid cell cultures produce growth factor-independent or tumorigenic cell lines. We conclude that at least two genetic events are needed to convert a murine myeloid precursor into a tumorigenic cell line. The first event occurs in Fr-MuLV-infected mice, generating cells that are growth factor dependent but immortal in vitro. The second event, which can be accomplished by Ab-MuLV infection, converts these immortal myeloid precursors into growth factor-independent and tumorigenic cells.","['Oliff, A', 'Agranovsky, O', 'McKinney, M D', 'Murty, V V', 'Bauchwitz, R']","['Oliff A', 'Agranovsky O', 'McKinney MD', 'Murty VV', 'Bauchwitz R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Harvey murine sarcoma virus/genetics', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Oncogenes']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.10.3306 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 May;82(10):3306-10. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.10.3306.,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC397764,,,,,,,

Phosphates of carbocyclic nucleoside analogs as inhibitors of hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase.,666-75,"In cell cultures treated with the carbocyclic analog of adenosine (C-Ado, (+/-)-aristeromycin), the utilization of hypoxanthine and guanine has been observed to be blocked. In an attempt to define the mechanism of this inhibition, we have reexamined the metabolism of C-Ado and its effects on the metabolism of guanine and hypoxanthine. In cultures of L1210 cells, C-Ado at a concentration of 25 microM inhibited the utilization of hypoxanthine and guanine for nucleotide synthesis by more than 90% but produced little or no inhibition of the utilization of these bases in cultures of L1210/MeMPR cells which lack adenosine kinase and cannot phosphorylate C-Ado. In cultures of mammalian cells (L1210, HEp-2, and colon-26 cells), C-Ado was converted to the triphosphate (as previously observed) and also to the triphosphate of the carbocyclic analog of guanosine. The presence of coformycin in the medium at a concentration sufficient to inhibit AMP deaminase almost completely prevented the formation of carbocyclic GTP; thus, the deamination of C-Ado monophosphate is essential for the formation of phosphates of carbocyclic guanosine. Since hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase is known to be subject to end product inhibition, it was considered likely that phosphates of carbocyclic guanosine or carbocyclic inosine, present in C-Ado-treated cells, were responsible for inhibition of utilization of hypoxanthine and guanine. The 5'-phosphates of the carbocyclic analogs of inosine and guanosine were synthesized and found to be effective inhibitors of the phosphoribosyltransferase. Carbocyclic GMP was a better inhibitor than carbocyclic IMP and was also superior to GMP and IMP; the concentration of C-GMP that produced a 50% inhibition of GMP formation was approximately 1 microM. It is probable that the presence of phosphates of carbocyclic guanosine accounts for the inhibition of utilization of hypoxanthine and guanine in C-Ado-treated cells.","['Bennett, L L Jr', 'Brockman, R W', 'Rose, L M', 'Allan, P W', 'Shaddix, S C', 'Shealy, Y F', 'Clayton, J D']","['Bennett LL Jr', 'Brockman RW', 'Rose LM', 'Allan PW', 'Shaddix SC', 'Shealy YF', 'Clayton JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Inosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '19186-33-5 (aristeromycin)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '3545-76-4 (Cyclic IMP)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '97727-47-4 (carbocyclic guanosine monophosphate)', '97727-48-5 (carbocyclic inosine monophosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line', 'Coformycin/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclic IMP/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hypoxanthines/*metabolism', 'Inosine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pentosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism']",1985/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1985 Jun;27(6):666-75.,['5 PO1-CA34200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

FeLV-UV alters in vitro murine T lymphocyte behavior by reversibly impairing lymphokine secretion.,583-90,"Murine splenocytes and cloned murine T cells were used to study the in vitro immunosuppressive effects of UV-inactivated feline leukemia virus (FeLV-UV) on lymphokine secretion. FeLV-UV can significantly depress the accumulation of IL 2 in cultures of Con A-stimulated C57BL/6 splenocytes and in cultures containing the alloreactive helper T cell clone B6D/2-2m plus Con A. Inhibition of lymphokine accumulation in these cultures could not be attributed to absorption or inactivation of IL 2 by the FeLV-UV or to the FeLV-UV-induced production of substances which interfere with the IL 2 bioassay. Thus, FeLV-UV appears to block production and/or secretion of IL 2 by a direct inhibitory effect on IL 2-secreting murine T lymphocytes. Additional studies indicate that FeLV-UV impairs IL 2 production only if added very soon after lymphocyte contact with lymphokine-inducing agents and that IL 2 secretion resumes when FeLV-UV is removed from the culture. FeLV-UV also impairs accumulation of MAF (interferon-gamma?) in cultures of Con A-stimulated C57BL/6 splenocytes and in cultures containing the alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone B6D/2-7c plus Con A. The latter observation again suggests that FeLV-UV impairs lymphokine secretion by a direct effect on lymphokine-producing T lymphocytes. Furthermore, it suggests that FeLV-UV does not selectively impair production of IL 2 nor does it have selective inhibitory effects on helper T cells. Rather, FeLV-UV appears to have a general inhibitory effect on lymphokine production by T lymphocytes. Finally, concentrations of FeLV-UV which suppress MAF production by the CTL clone have little influence on the cytolysis mediated by the same cloned T cell population. Thus, the immunosuppressive influence of FeLV-UV is selective for phenomena associated with induction of new T lymphocyte functions, such as lymphokine secretion, and spares other immune functions already expressed by the same cells.","['Orosz, C G', 'Zinn, N E', 'Olsen, R G', 'Mathes, L E']","['Orosz CG', 'Zinn NE', 'Olsen RG', 'Mathes LE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-Activating Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Macrophage-Activating Factors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jul;135(1):583-90.,"['AI20851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Chemotactic concentrations of LTB4 elicited a rapid increase in [Ca+2]in, which reached a peak within 0.6 to 1 min and then decayed back to baseline levels by 6 to 10 min. The maximal increase and the half-maximal increase in [Ca+2]in were achieved by LTB4 at mean concentrations of 5 X 10(-10) M and 2 X 10(-10) M, respectively, where the binding of LTB4 to high-affinity receptors predominates. A rank order of potency of LTB4 greater than 5(S),12(S)-6-trans-LTB4 greater than 12(S)-LTB4 was established for the elicitation of increases in [Ca+2]in, which reflects the binding of the isomers to low-affinity receptors. PMN leukocytes were preincubated with 10(-8) M LTB4 to induce chemotactic deactivation, which eliminates the expression of high-affinity receptors without altering the expression of the low-affinity receptors for LTB4. LTB4 elicited an increase in [Ca+2]in in the deactivated PMN leukocytes with an EC50 of 3 X 10(-8) M, which is similar to the Kd for LTB4 binding to the low-affinity receptors. Two lines of cultured human leukemic cells, IM-9 and HL-60, did not bind LTB4 specifically and did not show any change in [Ca+2]in upon the addition of 3 X 10(-8) M LTB4. The HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line was induced to differentiate in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide to leukocytes with more mature myelocytic characteristics. Differentiated HL-60 cells expressed an average of 54,000 low-affinity receptors for LTB4 per cell with an average dissociation constant of 7.3 X 10(-8) M and concurrently developed the capacity to respond to LTB4 with an increase in [Ca+2]in. The binding of LTB4 to either high-affinity or low-affinity receptors appears to be sufficient to initiate an increase in [Ca+2]in in human PMN leukocytes and differentiated HL-60 cells. The specificity of LTB4 receptors in transducing maximum increases in [Ca+2]in is determined by the subset of receptors that predominate as a result of the concentration of LTB4 and the state of the responding cells.","['Goldman, D W', 'Gifford, L A', 'Olson, D M', 'Goetzl, E J']","['Goldman DW', 'Gifford LA', 'Olson DM', 'Goetzl EJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '83104-85-2 (Quin2-acetoxymethyl ester)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Calcium/*biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jul;135(1):525-30.,"['AI-19784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-31809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Experiments were performed to further characterize this event with respect to iron metabolism and heme synthesis. In control cells, up to 85% of the iron taken up from iron-transferrin was incorporated into ferritin, 7% into heme, and the remainder into compartments not yet identified. In cells grown with desferrioxamine, net accumulation of intracellular desferrioxamine (14-fold) was observed and iron incorporation into ferritin and heme was inhibited by 86% and 75%, respectively. In contrast, complete inhibition of heme synthesis in cells grown with succinylacetone had no effect on transferrin binding or iron uptake. Exogenous hemin (30 microM) inhibited transferrin binding and iron uptake by 70% and heme synthesis by 90%. These effects were already evident after 2 h. Thus, although heme production could be reduced by desferrioxamine, succinylacetone, and hemin, cell iron uptake was enhanced only by the intracellular iron chelator. The effects of exogenous heme are probably unphysiologic and the greater inhibition of iron flow into heme can be explained by effects on early steps of heme synthesis. We conclude that in this cell model a chelatable intracellular iron pool rather than heme synthesis mediates regulation of iron uptake.","['Bottomley, S S', 'Wolfe, L C', 'Bridges, K R']","['Bottomley SS', 'Wolfe LC', 'Bridges KR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Deferoxamine/metabolism', 'Heme/biosynthesis', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1985/06/10 00:00,1985/06/10 00:01,['1985/06/10 00:00'],"['1985/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)88852-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Jun 10;260(11):6811-5.,,,,,,,,,,,

At 10(-8) M, a concentration that induced maturation, TPA effectively stimulated C-kinase activity in cell-free preparations by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+. Similar activation was observed with 20 micrograms/ml of OAG. At these concentrations, addition of either compound to intact cells stimulated the phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Treatment with TPA resulted in an increased phosphorylation of 14 proteins, 9 of which also changed in response to OAG. In addition to the effects on protein phosphorylation, TPA and OAG both affected choline lipid metabolism. TPA at 10(-8) M stimulated the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and lysophosphatidylcholine. OAG at 20 micrograms/ml had quantitatively similar effects on the labeling of the former two lipids, but did not affect incorporation of choline into lysophosphatidylcholine. Despite the similar biochemical effects of TPA and OAG, the diglyceride was unable to induce HL-60 cell maturation as measured by inhibition of cell growth, development of nonspecific esterase activity, phagocytosis, adherence of cells to plastic, and loss of transferrin receptor activity. The lack of effect is not due to metabolism of OAG; maturation could not be induced by treating cells with fresh OAG every 2 h for a period of 12 h. These results suggest a dissociation of the activation of C-kinase and the induction of HL-60 cell maturation by TPA.","['Kreutter, D', 'Caldwell, A B', 'Morin, M J']","['Kreutter D', 'Caldwell AB', 'Morin MJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1985/05/25 00:00,1985/05/25 00:01,['1985/05/25 00:00'],"['1985/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)88925-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 May 25;260(10):5979-84.,"['AM19813/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The optimal treatment conditions included incubation with antibody for 30 min at 37 degrees C followed by 3 additions of human complement 30 min apart. Cell lysis ranged from 94 to 98% in 4 SCC cell lines at antibody dilutions of 1:100: a lower level of lysis (60%) occurred in a lung squamous-cell carcinoma cell line. The cytotoxic effect was strictly complement-dependent. No cytotoxic effect was seen with other human cell lines including lung adenocarcinoma, lung large-cell carcinoma, myeloid leukemia, and lymphoblastic leukemia. No lysis was seen with nucleated marrow cells from healthy volunteers. Normal marrow cells in excess did not inhibit SCC cell lysis. Incubation with antibody and complement resulted in a 100-fold reduction of colony formation of SCC cells, but did not reduce the number of colonies of marrow-cell precursors, including CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-C.

In the second patient the concentration of the paraprotein decreased considerably. Because both patients were no longer under cytostatic treatment after manifestation of the paraproteinaemia, and were in complete remission during the whole of the observation period (4 years and 1 year), a direct relationship with the primary disease is unlikely.

Cells from this leukemia are characterized by the expression of large numbers of receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2). In an attempt to prepare an immunotoxin with selective cytotoxicity for ATL cells, we conjugated anti-Tac, a monoclonal anti-IL-2 receptor antibody, to purified ricin A chains. Although unmodified anti-Tac had no effect on the protein synthesis of these cells, anti-Tac-ricin A chain conjugates produced half-maximal inhibition of protein synthesis in HTLV-1-infected leukemic T cell lines at concentrations of 2 to 6 X 10(-10) mol/L (ID50). An essentially identical ID50 was obtained with leukemic peripheral blood T lymphocytes isolated from two patients with ATL. In contrast, half-maximal inhibition of protein synthesis in HTLV-uninfected, IL-2 receptor-negative T and B cell lines required 200- to 1,000-fold higher concentrations of anti-Tac-ricin A chain conjugates. Both unconjugated anti-Tac and immunoaffinity-purified IL-2 completely inhibited the toxic effects of anti-Tac-ricin A, confirming the specificity of the conjugate-IL-2 receptor interaction. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that anti-Tac-ricin A chain was able to eliminate greater than 99.9% of an HTLV-1-infected T cell population at concentrations only marginally affecting IL-2 receptor-negative cells.

Using potentiometric and spectroscopic measurements we have shown that carminomycin forms with Fe(III) a well-defined species in which three molecules of drug are chelated to one Fe(III) ion. This occurs with the release of one proton per molecule of drug. Magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that six oxygen atoms are bound to iron. The stability constant is 3 X 10(34). The in vitro inhibition of P 388 leukemia cell growth by this complex compares with that of the free drug.

The potassium equilibrium potential of the cells was found to be -71 +/- 7 mV. The resting membrane potential was partly dissipated by the protonophore m-chlorocarbonylcyanidephenylhydrazone (10 microM), but was unaffected by ouabain (1 mM) and apparently by the calcium ionophore A23187 (2.5 microM). Monensin (20 microM) caused a hyperpolarization which, since it was blocked by ouabain, was presumed to be brought about by activation of the Na+K+-ATPase via an elevated cytoplasmic Na+ concentration. Adriamycin at concentrations as high as 5 X 10(-4) M brought about no change in the resting potential of the cells. Also, cytotoxic concentrations of adriamycin, unlike ouabain, had no effect on rubidium-86 transport into L1210 cells, nor upon a monensin-induced increased in rubidium-86 uptake. The results suggest that although adriamycin is capable of interaction with the plasma membrane, and may exert its cytotoxicity at this locus, changes in ion flux mediated by Na+K+-ATPase or those capable of changing the membrane potential do not appear to be implicated in its mechanism of action.","['Chahwala, S B', 'Hickman, J A']","['Chahwala SB', 'Hickman JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Trityl Compounds)', '15912-74-0 (triphenylmethylphosphonium)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Onium Compounds/metabolism', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/analysis', 'Trityl Compounds/metabolism']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(85)90691-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(85)90691-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1985 May 1;34(9):1501-5. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90691-4.,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of infection depends on a variety of factors including the virus does encountered and the age and immune status of the host. FeLVs can establish persistent infection, either overt or latent. Degenerative diseases of the haemopoietic system are the most common result of persistent infection and immunosuppression with secondary infection accounts for more deaths than does neoplastic disease. However, more is known about the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis in this system and there are now numerous examples of field case tumours where FeLV has transduced an oncogene or acted as an insertional mutagen. The factors affecting the relative frequency of these mechanisms are considered as is the possibility that recombinant env gene recombinants play a role in FeLV pathogenesis.","['Neil, J C', 'Onions, D E']","['Neil JC', 'Onions DE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/immunology', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/immunology/*microbiology/transmission', 'Cats', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology/transmission/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/classification/*genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/microbiology/veterinary', 'Oncogenes', 'Sarcoma/microbiology/veterinary', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1985 Jan-Feb;5(1):49-63.,,126,,,,,,,,,

Examples can be found from several different types of tumour with the bulk of the data deriving from neuroblastoma and myeloid leukaemia. There is no clear correlation of inducer with cell type, other than some specific peptides like MSH, and agents such as dimethyl sulphoxide and dexamethasone have wide ranging activity. Steroid hormone action may require interaction between different cell types, and the inability of tumours to differentiate in situ may implicate reduced cell-cell interaction, possibly due to degradation of extracellular matrix, or to alteration of the stromal phenotype by tumour-derived factors such as peptides or prostaglandins. When differentiation has been demonstrated, it has been possible, in some cases, to correlate increased differentiation with reduced malignancy by in vitro characterisation or tumorigenicity. Conditions which induce differentiation in rat mammary carcinoma and mouse myeloma also reduce tumour growth in vivo. Clinical trials have not provided any conclusive evidence for a therapeutic benefit so far, but relatively few trials have been carried out.

The polymorphism at both loci was due to the presence or absence of a long interspersed repeated DNA element (LINE). The LINE insertion in the Igh locus occurred in the joining (J) region, which is involved in the physiological rearrangement of this locus. The LINE insertion in the Mlvi-2 locus has occurred approximately 6 kilobases from the region of provirus integration in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat thymomas. The two inserts are colinear with each other and with other randomly selected cloned copies of the rat LINE family, the general characteristics of which we also present. LINE insertion in the Mlvi-2 locus was observed in several rat strains, established from independent rat colonies, suggesting that LINE-containing Mlvi-2 alleles may be widespread in the rat population. LINE insertion in the Igh locus was observed in 1 of 27 rats. The detection of a LINE-related polymorphism at two nonselected loci indicates that LINEs are transposable. The presence or absence of these long (greater than 5 kilobases), highly transcribed elements at single-copy loci could have profound effects on gene activity. Furthermore, LINE-containing single-copy loci could be affected by homologous interaction between the resident LINE and any of the other 50,000 or so copies of these elements in the rat genome.","['Economou-Pachnis, A', 'Lohse, M A', 'Furano, A V', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Economou-Pachnis A', 'Lohse MA', 'Furano AV', 'Tsichlis PN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Attachment Sites, Microbiological', 'DNA/*genetics', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Rats', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.9.2857 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 May;82(9):2857-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.9.2857.,"['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR95539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC397665,,,,,,,

It shares the transformation-specific myc sequence with three other avian carcinoma viruses (MC29, MH2, CMII) and also with a normal chicken gene proto-myc and the gag, pol, and env elements with non-transforming retroviruses. Unlike the other myc-containing viruses, which synthesize singular myc proteins, OK10 synthesizes two different myc-related proteins of 200 and 57 kDa. Here we have sequenced the myc region of an infectious OK10 provirus to investigate how OK10 synthesizes two different proteins from the same myc domain and to identify characteristic differences between the normal proto-myc gene and the myc-related viral transforming genes. It was found that the 1.6-kilobase myc domain of OK10 is colinear and coterminal with the myc domains of MC29, MH2, and the terminal two exons of proto-myc. It is preceded by the same splice acceptor as the myc sequence of MH2 and as the second proto-myc exon. From this and the known structure of retroviruses, it follows that the OK10 gene encoding the 57-kDa protein is discontinuous with a small 5' exon that includes six gag codons and a large 3' myc exon (delta gag-myc). This gene and the delta gag-myc gene of MH2 are isogenic. The proto-myc-derived intron preceding the myc domain of OK10 is in the same reading frame as the adjacent delta pol and myc domains and, hence, is part of the gag-delta pol-myc gene encoding the 200-kDa protein. Sequence comparisons with proto-myc and MC29 and MH2 indicate that there are no characteristic mutations that set apart the viral myc domains from proto-myc. It is concluded that transforming function of viral myc-related genes correlates with the lack of a viral equivalent of the first proto-myc exon(s) and conjugation of the viral myc domains with large or small retroviral genetic elements rather than with specific point mutations. Because OK10 and MH2 each contain two genes with potential transforming function (namely, delta gag-myc and gag-delta pol-myc or delta gag-mht, respectively), it remains to be determined whether the delta gag-myc genes have transforming function on their own or need helper genes. The possible helper requirement cannot be very specific because the two potential helper genes are very different.","['Hayflick, J', 'Seeburg, P H', 'Ohlsson, R', 'Pfeifer-Ohlsson, S', 'Watson, D', 'Papas, T', 'Duesberg, P H']","['Hayflick J', 'Seeburg PH', 'Ohlsson R', 'Pfeifer-Ohlsson S', 'Watson D', 'Papas T', 'Duesberg PH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Species Specificity']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.9.2718 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 May;82(9):2718-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.9.2718.,['CA 11426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC397636,['GENBANK/M11352'],,,,,,

A 92-kilodalton protein, NCP92, was found to be the mammalian counterpart of the previously identified avian c-fps/fes protein NCP98 by its structural similarity to NCP98, its associated tyrosine kinase activity, and its similar tissue distribution. The highest levels of NCP92 were found in tissue macrophages and in bone marrow. In bone marrow NCP92 expression was restricted to cells of the monocyte/macrophage and granulocyte lineages. That the expression of NCP92 is limited to these cell types was confirmed by the analysis of murine and human hematopoietic tumors representing different cell lineages: NCP92 was positive in leukemic cells of granulocytic and monocytic origin but not in B-lymphocytic, T-lymphocytic, or erythroid tumor cells.

We previously reported that structural rearrangements in the cellular oncogene c-erbB correlate with the development of erythroblastosis induced by avian leukosis virus (ALV). c-erbB recently has been shown to be related to the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor. We now have characterized the detailed mechanisms of c-erbB activation by ALV proviruses. We report here that the ALV proviral integration sites are clustered 5' to the region where homology to v-erbB starts, suggesting that interruption in this region of c-erbB is important for its activation. The proviruses are oriented in the same transcriptional direction as c-erbB and usually are full-size. The latter finding is in contrast to the frequent deletions observed within the c-myc-linked proviruses in B-cell lymphomas. We have also identified a second c-erbB allele, which differs from the previously known allele primarily by a deletion in an intron region. This allele is also oncogenic upon mutation by an ALV provirus.","['Raines, M A', 'Lewis, W G', 'Crittenden, L B', 'Kung, H J']","['Raines MA', 'Lewis WG', 'Crittenden LB', 'Kung HJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Attachment Sites, Microbiological', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Genes, Viral', '*Oncogenes', 'Operon', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.8.2287 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Apr;82(8):2287-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.8.2287.,['CA33158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC397542,,,,,,,

The gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CATase) was linked to an HTLV-I LTR sequence (pLTR-CAT) by replacing the simian virus 40 promoter in plasmid pSV2-CAT with the LTR sequence. The transient CATase activities of cells transfected with the plasmids were compared. The results are summarized as follows: The HTLV LTR was active even in an epithelial cell line, with efficiency similar to that of the simian virus 40 promoter. pLTR-CAT expressed high CATase activity, 40-200 times that expressed by pSV2-CAT, in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, such as the human cell lines MT-2 and HUT-102, or in HTLV-I-infected rat cell lines. This enhanced activity of the LTR seems to be associated with HTLV gene expression, since only low activity of pLTR-CAT was observed in the HTLV-infected cell line MT-1, in which only a small percent of cells express viral antigens. In HTLV-infected rat cell lines, the pX-encoded protein p40x was the only viral protein detected. Thus, we suggest that p40x is the factor associated directly or indirectly with the enhanced activity of the LTR.","['Fujisawa, J', 'Seiki, M', 'Kiyokawa, T', 'Yoshida, M']","['Fujisawa J', 'Seiki M', 'Kiyokawa T', 'Yoshida M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Operon', 'Plasmids', 'Rats', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.8.2277 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Apr;82(8):2277-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.8.2277.,,,,PMC397540,,,,,,,

While the other murine CSFs (granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, macrophage (M)-CSF and multi-CSF) show little or no differentiation-inducing activity on murine myelomonocytic leukaemia cell lines, G-CSF (or MGI-2(6)) is able to induce the production of terminally differentiated cells from WEHI-3B and other myeloid leukaemia cell lines.

It is important to identify the human analogue of murine G-CSF so that its effectiveness on human myeloid leukaemia cells can be assessed.

The enhancer elements of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) are localized in a tandemly repeated region (approximately 75 base pairs (bp) long), which lies 5' to the CAT and TATA promoter elements in the U3 region of the LTR (see Fig. 1). We have shown that the tandem repeats are required both for LTR promoter activity, as measured by transient expression assays, and for biological activity, as measured by production of infectious virus. Furthermore, they can be replaced by transcriptional enhancers from the F101 host-range mutant of polyoma virus without loss of function. We report here that the addition of the polyoma (PyF101) enhancers to the M-MuLV LTRs (either with or without the M-MuLV tandem repeats) results in complete loss of viral leukaemogenicity, even though the virus can replicate to high titres in tissue culture fibroblasts and can establish infection in animals.","['Davis, B', 'Linney, E', 'Fan, H']","['Davis B', 'Linney E', 'Fan H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polyomavirus/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1985/04/11 00:00,1985/04/11 00:01,['1985/04/11 00:00'],"['1985/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/314550a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Apr 11-17;314(6011):550-3. doi: 10.1038/314550a0.,"['CA32454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

These leukemia cells invariably contain large amounts of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA and MMTV proteins and have extra MMTV proviruses integrated in their DNA. We show here that the extra MMTV proviruses are all derived from the endogenous MMTV provirus associated with the Mtv-2 locus and that the T-cell leukemias are clonal with respect to the acquired MMTV proviruses. The extra MMTV proviruses in six transplantable T-cell leukemia lines studied had rearranged, shortened long terminal repeats (LTRs); each T-cell leukemia, however, had a different LTR rearrangement within its extra MMTV provirus. The alteration within the extra LTRs of T-cell leukemia line 42 involved deletion of 453 nucleotides and generation of a tandem repeat region consisting of regions flanking the deletion. This alteration generated a sequence similar to the adenovirus enhancer core sequence. The viral RNAs in the T-cell leukemias contained corresponding alterations in their U3 regions. These results demonstrate that expression of MMTV in T-cell leukemias of GR mice may be the consequence of the generation of a novel enhancer, which could also stimulate expression of any adjacent cellular oncogene.","['Michalides, R', 'Wagenaar, E', 'Weijers, P']","['Michalides R', 'Wagenaar E', 'Weijers P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.5.4.823-830.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Apr;5(4):823-30. doi: 10.1128/mcb.5.4.823-830.1985.,,,,PMC366787,['GENBANK/M10761'],,,,,,

Nuclei from M-MuLV-infected mouse NIH 3T3 cells were digested with limited amounts of DNase I, and hypersensitive (HS) sites were mapped by the indirect end labeling technique. Particular emphasis was placed on the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), since viral transcription initiates there. M-MuLV proviral DNA showed two strong DNase I-HS sites in the 5' LTR, one coincident with the transcription initiation (cap) site and the other with the transcriptional enhancers. Two weaker DNase I-HS sites were also detected in internal proviral DNA. The 3' LTR also showed a strong HS site in the region of the enhancers, but an HS site at the cap site of the 3' LTR was not detected. Thus, the chromatin configurations of the 5' and 3' LTRs of integrated M-MuLV proviruses appear to be different. The chromatin configuration of M-MuLV proviruses which contain LTR insertions of polyomavirus enhancer sequences was also studied. The 5' LTR of M-MuLV proviruses containing polyoma enhancer sequences substituted for the M-MuLV enhancers showed two strong HS sites, one in the polyoma sequences and one at the cap site. The 5' LTR of M-MuLV proviruses containing polyoma enhancer sequences inserted into the wild-type M-MuLV LTR between the cap site and the M-MuLV enhancers showed three HS sites. Two HS sites corresponded to those of the wild-type M-MuLV LTR, whereas the third mapped to the inserted polyoma sequences.

Carboxylic esterase.,209-29,"The isoenzyme patterns of carboxylic esterase (E.C. 3.1.1.1) were studied in 74 proven human leukemia-lymphoma and 12 normal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. These cell lines have been extensively phenotyped using poly- and monoclonal antibodies. Esterase isoenzymes were separated by isoelectric focusing and visualized by histo-cytochemical techniques. No leukemia-specific or (except for monocytes) blood cell type-specific isoenzyme or isoenzyme pattern could be detected. The monocytic element in some cell lines was characterized by a strong isoenzyme band which could be selectively and completely inhibited by sodium fluoride. The enzyme phenotypes were stably expressed in all subcultures of a given cell line and did not appear to have any cell cycle dependency. The leukemia-lymphoma cell lines have been subclassified into four major groups according to immunological parameters: T-cell, B-cell, myelomonocytic and non-T, non-B-cell. On the basis of immunological data the T-cell lines were assigned to five stages of differentiation. The number and staining intensity of the isoenzymes increased with differentiation of the T-cells paralleling the expression of immunological markers. The B-cell leukemia-lymphoma cell lines were divided into pre B-, B-, Burkitt lymphoma, multiple myeloma and hairy cell leukemia cell lines. Substantial variability among the isoenzyme patterns was detected ranging from immature profiles of pre B-cell lines to complete isoenzyme repertoires of multiple myeloma cell lines. No significant difference was seen between the isoenzymes of mature B-cell lines and normal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. The most prominent feature seen in myelomonocytic cell lines was the monocytic band indicating a monocytic origin and separating the 'monocytoid' from the 'pure myeloid' cell lines. Considerable heterogeneity in the isoenzyme patterns was observed in the non-T, non-B cell groups which comprised erythroleukemia cell lines and cell lines arrested at a very early stage of lymphoid differentiation.

Studies with mouse L1210 and human HL-60 cell lines revealed that glucocorticoid (GC) receptors accumulate during G1 phase of the cell cycle. In human lymphoblastic leukemia, the per cell receptor number was highest in cells in S and G2 phase and lowest in small, noncycling cells. In normal human white blood cells, GC receptor content was maximal in large lymphocytes and monocytes while no receptors were present in small lymphocytes. However, the receptor density of large lymphocytes was still 3-4 fold lower than of leukemic lymphoblasts of similar size. In L1210 cells the number of GC receptors decreased considerably in stationary cultures or following inhibition of cell cycle progression by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbc-AMP). Receptor content was also reduced in cells growing as ascites tumors in hosts with terminal disease. Accordingly, the receptor content in leukemic blasts appeared highly dependent on cell cycle distribution and on the proliferative status of the tumor cells. These findings may in part explain the large interpatient variation and the conflicting views regarding GC receptor content and prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Smets, L A', 'van der Klooster, P', 'Otte, A']","['Smets LA', 'van der Klooster P', 'Otte A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90083-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90083-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(2):199-207. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90083-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth inhibition is demonstrated to be due to specific binding of IL-2 to receptors on the TL cells.","['Sugamura, K', 'Nakai, S', 'Fujii, M', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Sugamura K', 'Nakai S', 'Fujii M', 'Hinuma Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.161.5.1243 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 May 1;161(5):1243-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.161.5.1243.,,,,PMC2187604,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been reported that IL-2 stimulates T-lymphocyte proliferation via IL-2 receptor by induction of transferrin receptor on these cells. Using leukemic T cells as a model of the monoclonal mature T cell, we examined those sequential steps of T-cell activation. Our studies revealed that transferrin receptors do not always appear after IL-2 receptor expression, IL-2 up-regulates the expression of IL-2 receptor but not of transferrin receptor, and IL-2 can initiate DNA synthesis without altering transferrin receptor expression. Thus, the sequential activation steps reported for normal T cells were not observed in the present study on leukemic T cells. These data suggest that there are other pathways to DNA synthesis in leukemic T cells and even in normal T cells.","['Tsuda, H', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Tsuda H', 'Takatsuki K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00915008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1985 Mar;5(2):109-14. doi: 10.1007/BF00915008.,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of ribosomes bound to its cytoplasmic surface suggests that it could be a site of synthesis of membrane glycoproteins. We have examined the biogenesis of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein in the nuclear envelope as a model for the biogenesis of membrane glycoproteins. G protein was present in nuclear membranes of infected Friend erythroleukemia cells immediately following synthesis and was transported out of nuclear membranes to cytoplasmic membranes with a time course similar to transport from rough endoplasmic reticulum (t 1/2 = 5-7 min). Temperature-sensitive mutations in viral membrane proteins which block transport of G protein from endoplasmic reticulum also blocked transport of G protein from the nuclear envelope. Friend erythroleukemia cells and NIH 3T3 cells differed in the fraction of newly synthesized G protein found in nuclear membranes, apparently reflecting the relative amount of nuclear membrane compared to endoplasmic reticulum available for glycoprotein synthesis. Nuclear membranes from erythroleukemia cells appeared to have the enzymatic activities necessary for cleavage of the signal sequence and core glycosylation of newly synthesized G protein. Signal peptidase activity was detected by the ability of detergent-solubilized membranes of isolated nuclei to correctly remove the signal sequence of human preplacental lactogen. RNA isolated from the nuclear envelope was highly enriched for G protein mRNA, suggesting that G protein was synthesized on the outer nuclear membrane rather than redistributing to nuclear membranes from endoplasmic reticulum before or during cell fractionation. These results suggest a mechanism for incorporation of membrane glycoproteins into the nuclear envelope and suggest that in some cell types the nuclear envelope is a major source of newly synthesized membrane glycoproteins.","['Puddington, L', 'Lively, M O', 'Lyles, D S']","['Puddington L', 'Lively MO', 'Lyles DS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus', '*Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",1985/05/10 00:00,1985/05/10 00:01,['1985/05/10 00:00'],"['1985/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89071-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 May 10;260(9):5641-7.,"['AI15892/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 32861/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

VSV replicated much less effectively in HEp-2 cells grown in DM as compared to serum containing complete medium (CM). Observed reduction in the rate of virus multiplication was, at least in part, due to reduced virus penetration which was monitored using VSV labeled with nitroxyl free radicals as electron spin probe. Surface proteins of VSV were labeled with maleimide spin-label, and succinimide spin-label. Ni2+ was used as a broadening agent to identify the spin-label signals from viruses inside the cell. HEp-2 cells and mouse leukemia cell line L1210 treated with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) cadaverine, an agent previously shown to inhibit the uptake of VSV in vitro, was used as a positive control in some experiments. VSV penetrated less effectively in both DM-grown cells and in CM-grown cells in the presence of dansylcadaverine. Similar results were obtained by monitoring the uptake of 125I-labeled VSV. When HEp-2 cells grown for several generations in DM were incubated with 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h, the cells supported virus replication to a similar extent as the cells grown in CM. In contrast, addition of arachidonic acid restored VSV growth only partially. Continued growth of HEp-2 cells in DM resulted in a shift in fatty acyl chain composition of phospholipids. The results indicate a finite role for essential fatty acids in receptor-mediated internalization of virus particles.","['Pottathil, R', 'Gutierrez, P L', 'Davis, L H', 'Chandrabose, K A']","['Pottathil R', 'Gutierrez PL', 'Davis LH', 'Chandrabose KA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)', 'I9N81SC5HD (monodansylcadaverine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadaverine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', '*Endocytosis', 'Fatty Acids/analysis', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Nickel/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Spin Labels', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*metabolism']",1985/05/10 00:00,1985/05/10 00:01,['1985/05/10 00:00'],"['1985/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89016-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 May 10;260(9):5265-70.,,,,,,,,,,,

In a group of 167 retired breeders followed for spontaneous tumors, the probability of survival for mice eventually dying with a tumor was greater for the NK-competent, +/bg than for the NK-deficient, homozygous C57BL/6-bg/bg mice (p = 0.0019), although the higher overall incidence of tumors in the bg/bg group (48%) was not significantly different from that in the +/bg group (37%). In the bg/bg group the incidence of tumor death appeared to increase relatively sharply in the 25- to 29-month age bracket compared to the fairly regular increase in incidence observed in the +/bg group. All the spontaneous tumors except 2 (discovered in +/bg mice) were classified histologically as widely disseminated malignant lymphomas. The other two were one squamous-cell carcinoma and one sarcoma. A total of 73 bg/bg mice injected s.c. with benzo[alpha]pyrene (BP) had a higher overall incidence of tumors (81%) (rhabdomyosarcomas) than 138 +/bg mice (64%) and in the largest group (0.3 mg, n = 85) the bg/bg group developed tumors, at a higher incidence (p = 0.01) and with a shorter latency (p = 0.025) than the +/bg group. On the other hand, mice injected with dimethylbenzanthracene or given 4 weekly doses of 160 rads of gamma irradiation showed no difference in overall tumor incidence. In addition, mice injected with various doses of DMBA-induced murine leukemia virus (DMBA-LV) also showed no significant difference in tumor incidence. Others have reported that some of these treatments (DMBA, split-dose irradiation) cause profound NK suppression, thereby reducing NK differences between the two groups of mice. These results suggest that a partial NK impairment in beige mutant mice early in life may lead to significantly greater rates of death with spontaneous malignant tumors late in life. Some primary oncogenesis treatments (BP) but not others (DMBA, split-dose irradiation, leukemia viruses) cause tumors with a greater incidence and shorter latency in beige mice.

AKR mice also are more susceptible to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced thymomas than are low-leukemia-incidence mouse strains. To determine whether virally and chemically induced lymphomagenesis proceeds by similar pathways in AKR mice, spontaneous and MNU-induced thymic lymphomas were analyzed for a DNA restriction linkage generated during spontaneous tumor development by recombination between envelope genes of endogenous murine leukemia proviral loci. DNA from spontaneous thymic lymphomas invariably contained a restriction fragment characteristic of recombinant murine leukemia virus etiology, while four of five MNU-induced thymic lymphomas did not show this restriction linkage. In addition, analysis of lymphocyte differentiation antigen profiles indicated that MNU-induced lymphomas represent a more immature stage of T-cell differentiation than the majority of spontaneous lymphomas. These data suggest that there are fundamental differences in the mechanisms of induction of virally and chemically induced thymic lymphomas in AKR mice.","['Richie, E R', 'Nairn, R S', 'Becker, F F']","['Richie ER', 'Nairn RS', 'Becker FF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Ly/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*etiology/immunology', 'Methylnitrosourea', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Phenotype', 'Thymus Neoplasms/chemically induced/etiology']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jun;45(6):2802-6.,"['CA 20657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Chickens were infected with ALV subgroup A by contact at hatching and by oral inoculation at 4-5 weeks of age. In the first experiment, chickens were inoculated with a virulent strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) at 1 day or 6 weeks of age. In the second experiment, chickens were neonatally treated with cyclophosphamide (CY), or were inoculated with strain T of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) at hatching, or were inoculated with strain JM of Marek's disease virus (MDV) at 2 weeks of age. The infection profile and cloacal shedding of ALV in chickens exposed to ALV and inoculated with immunodepressive viruses or CY were compared with those in hatchmates exposed only to ALV. In two of four chicken lines tested in the first experiment, shedding of ALV, as determined by virological assays of cloacal swabs at 22 weeks of age, was significantly higher in chickens infected with IBDV at 1 day of age than in uninfected hatchmates. The rate of shedding of ALV in one of these two lines was also significantly higher in chickens infected with IBDV at 6 weeks of age than in uninfected chickens. Further, the frequency of ALV-antibody detection at 22 weeks of age was significantly lower in chickens of these two lines infected with IBDV at 1 day of age than in uninfected chickens. In the second experiment, neonatal treatment with CY significantly increased the frequency of viremic chickens of both experimental and commercial flocks. The frequency of ALV-viremic chickens at 22 weeks of age was considerably higher in the REV- and MDV-inoculated groups (54% and 44%, respectively) than in control hatchmates (29%), but only in chickens of the commercial line. These findings suggest that chemically or virus-induced immunodepression may lead to an increase in rates of viremia and shedding of ALV in chickens infected with virus after hatching, especially in certain genetic lines.","['Fadly, A M', 'Witter, R L', 'Lee, L F']","['Fadly AM', 'Witter RL', 'Lee LF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology/isolation & purification', '*Chickens', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Infectious bursal disease virus/immunology', 'Male', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Poultry Diseases/*immunology', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/immunology', 'Viremia/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Avian Dis. 1985 Jan-Mar;29(1):12-25.,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that the majority of the sequences are organized into two complete provirus families integrated at multiple sites in the cell genome and that they are hypermethylated in embryonal carcinoma cells as compared with differentiated cells.

Both conditions are caused by an indigenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV). These mice have a lifelong persistent viremia with total immunologic tolerance to the virus. The characteristic pathologic features are centered on the anterior-lateral horns of the lumbosacral spinal cord and consist primarily of a noninflammatory spongiform change, with reactive gliosis and neuronal dropout. The main cause of neuronal death apparently is abortive intracytoplasmic replication of virus particles. Genetic control of the naturally occurring disease in wild mice is achieved by segregation of a dominant ecotropic virus restriction gene, Akvr-1R/Fv-4R. The neurologic and/or neoplastic diseases are readily reproduced by experimental inoculation of newborn susceptible laboratory mice with purified, cloned ecotropic virus derived from the affected wild mice.

Data are presented regarding the types of first and second neoplasm, the therapy administered, and the predisposing factors. Of the 292 cases (308 SMN), the most common primary was retinoblastoma followed by Hodgkin's disease, soft-tissue sarcomas, and Wilms' tumor. This is not similar to the relative frequency of these cancers in children but rather reflects specific risk factors. Bone sarcomas were the most common SMN among the 208 SMN developing in previously irradiated sites while acute leukemia was the most common SMN unassociated with radiation. Known predisposing conditions to cancer were present in 73 cases; retinoblastoma was the most common of these, followed by neurofibromatosis. There were ten patients with three and three patients with four malignant neoplasms. In 14 patients, the cause of SMN was not suggested by known risk factors as these patients had negative family histories and received no radiation or chemotherapy. We note, therefore, that although most cases of SMN in survivors of childhood cancer can be attributed to radiation, genetic disease, chemotherapy, or combinations of these, unrecognized predisposition or chance may also play a role.","['Meadows, A T', 'Baum, E', 'Fossati-Bellani, F', 'Green, D', 'Jenkin, R D', 'Marsden, B', 'Nesbit, M', 'Newton, W', 'Oberlin, O', 'Sallan, S G']","['Meadows AT', 'Baum E', 'Fossati-Bellani F', 'Green D', 'Jenkin RD', 'Marsden B', 'Nesbit M', 'Newton W', 'Oberlin O', 'Sallan SG', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Eye Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Retinoblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Wilms Tumor']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.4.532 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Apr;3(4):532-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.4.532.,"['CA 14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-91049/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The ecotropic/MCF (mink cell focus-inducing) mixture of MuLV stimulates polyclonal B lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation to antibody-secreting cells. Serum Ig levels are elevated for all isotypes except IgA. The viral infection leads to a rapid decline in T lymphocyte responses to mitogens and alloantigens, as well as a decrease in helper cell activity. Specific antibody responses to both T-dependent and T-independent antigens are impaired, and the response of B lymphocytes to mitogens is abolished. The profound immunosuppression seems to be due to the MuLV-induced polyclonal activation of lymphocytes. No active suppression of normal lymphocyte responses by cells from virus-infected mice was observed. The disease induced by the LP-BM5 MuLV isolate thus seems a promising model for the study of lymphocyte activation and the mechanisms of retrovirus-induced immunosuppression.","['Mosier, D E', 'Yetter, R A', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Mosier DE', 'Yetter RA', 'Morse HC 3rd']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/pathology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Female', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/etiology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/immunology/pathology']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.161.4.766 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Apr 1;161(4):766-84. doi: 10.1084/jem.161.4.766.,"['AI-15879/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-16120/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2189053,,,,,,,

FeLV-UV and specific FeLV proteins alter T lymphocyte behavior by inducing hyporesponsiveness to lymphokines.,3396-403,"Murine splenocytes were used to study the in vitro immunosuppressive effects of UV-inactivated feline leukemia virus (FeLV-UV). FeLV-UV blocks both alloantigen (DBA/2)-induced and Con A-induced proliferation of C57BL/6 splenocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, C57BL/6 anti-DBA/2 mixed lymphocyte cultures containing FeLV-UV fail to develop detectable DBA/2-specific cytolytic activity, although FeLV-UV has no effect on the cytolytic activity of preformed C57BL/6 anti-DBA/2 cytolytic T cells (CTL). Disruption of lymphocyte proliferation and CTL generation by FeLV-UV could not be overcome by the addition of exogenous lymphokines. These data suggest that FeLV-UV can interfere with the lymphokine reactivity of alloactivated lymphocytes. In fact, FeLV-UV blocks the lymphokine-induced proliferation of the murine IL 2-dependent cell line CTLL-20. The CTLL-20 cells were subsequently used to study the mechanism(s) by which retroviruses alter T lymphocyte function. Normally, CTLL-20 cells undergo significant proliferation when cultured in EL4 SN, an IL 2-containing culture supernatant from PMA-stimulated EL4 cells. This lymphokine-induced CTLL-20 proliferation is abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by UV-inactivated murine leukemia virus (MuLV-UV), FeLV-UV, and a purified 15,000 dalton viral protein, p15, derived from FeLV. Suppression of CTLL-20 proliferation requires only brief contact (6 hr) with FeLV-UV or with p15, but is most efficient after prolonged (24 hr) contact with these agents. Furthermore, suppression of CTLL-20 proliferation by FeLV-UV and p15 is reversible, because CTLL-20 cells which have been pretreated for 24 hr with FeLV-UV or p15 are equally as efficient at responding to EL4 SN as untreated CTLL-20. Additional studies indicate that CTLL-20 cells continue to remove IL 2 activity from EL4 SN in the presence of suppressive concentrations of FeLV-UV, and that suppressive concentrations of FeLV-UV do not remove IL 2 activity from EL4 SN. This suggests that FeLV does not block CTLL-20 proliferation by absorbing or inactivating IL 2, or by occluding IL 2 receptors, and that T lymphocytes develop an insensitivity to lymphokines after contact with FeLV-UV, which may be caused by a metabolic, rather than an immunologic, defect. Because lymphokines are requisite signals for T cell function, considerable immunosuppression would be associated with acquired lymphokine insensitivity.","['Orosz, C G', 'Zinn, N E', 'Olsen, R G', 'Mathes, L E']","['Orosz CG', 'Zinn NE', 'Olsen RG', 'Mathes LE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (p10 protein, feline leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology/radiation effects', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/pharmacology', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology/radiation effects']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 May;134(5):3396-403.,"['AI20851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Many investigators have used artificial agents to stimulate macrophages to produce IL 1. We now report production of large quantities of IL 1 after a physiologic stimulus. The Lyme disease spirochete, recently isolated and adapted for growth in vitro, was used to stimulate P388D1 cells or human peripheral blood monocytes. Spirochetes were added to confluent macrophage cultures in serum-free RPMI at a ratio of 10:1. The release of IL 1 was dose-dependent. The 24-hr supernatant IL 1 activity was determined by using the thymocyte Con A co-mitogenesis assay. Activity was not due to an endotoxin on, or produced by, the spirochete. A polymyxin B affinity column failed to remove activity, and polymyxin B in the spirochete-macrophage culture had no effect on IL 1 production. Supernatants were collected, were concentrated, and were subjected to size exclusion HPLC. Three areas of activity were found in P388D1 cell supernatants (Mr greater than 60,000, 40,000, and 20,000), whereas two peaks (Mr 23,000 and 13,000) were found in human monocyte supernatants. The Mr 20,000 and 13,000 peaks from murine and human cell supernatants, respectively, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were shown to be single bands (Mr 12,400 for the mouse IL 1 and Mr 13,500 for the human IL 1). Isoelectric focusing of column-purified IL 1 preparations showed two different pI in both human (pI 7.25 and 4.4 to 5) and murine (pI 7.25 and 5.55) IL 1. Fibroblasts cultured with murine or human IL 1 preparations demonstrated both an increase in secreted collagenase and increased cell proliferation. Thus, a physiologic stimulus and simple biochemical techniques produce large amounts of very pure mouse or human IL 1. That this IL 1 is produced by Lyme disease spirochete-stimulated macrophages may explain some of the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease.","['Habicht, G S', 'Beck, G', 'Benach, J L', 'Coleman, J L', 'Leichtling, K D']","['Habicht GS', 'Beck G', 'Benach JL', 'Coleman JL', 'Leichtling KD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endotoxins/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Lyme Disease/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microbial Collagenase/biosynthesis', 'Phagocytes/metabolism', 'Spirochaetales/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 May;134(5):3147-54.,['AG00801/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In these studies, leukemia cell lines cultured without serum and fresh leukemia cells were used to investigate the roles of Fe, transferrin receptors, and transferrin in leukemia cell growth, and mechanisms of 42/6 inhibition and resistance. HL60 and KG-1 leukemia cells grown in serum-free medium were inhibited by 42/6. In contrast to results in fetal calf serum (FCS), soluble Fe (ferric nitriloacetate) reversed 42/6 growth inhibition of serum-free HL60 cells. When HL60 cells were adapted for growth in serum-free, transferrin-free medium, they became refractory to 42/6 growth inhibition. By using radiolabeled transferrin and 42/6, HL60 cells cultured in FCS and transferrin displayed similar quantities of transferrin receptors (29,000-30,000/cell) and similar Kd's (3.8-4.9 X 10(-9) M). Cells grown in transferrin-free medium showed a similar Kd (3.1 X 10(-9) M), but fewer transferrin binding sites (5,000/cell). Transferrin-independent cells contained a log higher concentration of intracellular ferritin. For both FCS and serum-free HL60 cells, calculated affinities for 42/6 were lower (5.7-10.0 X 10(-9) M), but the number of binding sites was three- to fourfold higher. To investigate further the relationship between receptor display and antibody inhibition in proliferating normal and malignant myeloid cells, simultaneous immunofluorescence was used to determine the cell cycle status of transferrin receptor-positive cells. Malignant cells in S + G2/M displayed approximately 50% of the amount of transferrin receptors detected in normal dividing colony-stimulating factor-stimulated marrow cells. Receptor display by dividing cells from two patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was variable. When HL60 cells were exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide, transferrin receptor display decreased, and 42/6 growth inhibition was abrogated or greatly diminished. The presence of 42/6 did not prevent dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL60 differentiation in serum-containing or serum-free cultures. We conclude that human leukemia cells require Fe for growth and that 42/6 inhibits transferrin-dependent cells by Fe deprivation. Some dividing normal and differentiating malignant cells display reduced transferrin receptors, and can also escape antibody inhibition. The increased ferritin levels and decreased transferrin receptors in transferrin-independent HL60 cells confirm the inverse relationship between cell ferritin content and transferrin receptor display. These studies indicate a critical role for Fe in leukemia cell growth and possible roles in cellular differentiation.","['Taetle, R', 'Rhyner, K', 'Castagnola, J', 'To, D', 'Mendelsohn, J']","['Taetle R', 'Rhyner K', 'Castagnola J', 'To D', 'Mendelsohn J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111768 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Mar;75(3):1061-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI111768.,"['CA-32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC423664,,,,,,,

We postulate the existence in the chick system of a serum macrophage differentiation factor (M-DF) which converts early granulocytic progenitors (or exclusively diverts a common progenitor) into monocytic cells.","['Dodge, W H', 'Sharma, S']","['Dodge WH', 'Sharma S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*physiology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*physiology', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Culture Media', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041230217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1985 May;123(2):264-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041230217.,['CA 19275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes taken from the rabbits between 4 and 14 days after the inoculation of MT-2 cells, but not lymphocytes obtained in earlier or later periods, could be immortalized in vitro and expressed ATLA and type C virus particles. However, lymphocytes harvested during an early culture period (5 to 8 days) were found to be negative for ATLA. The transformed cells had the karyotype of a normal male rabbit. Two rabbits inoculated with the autologous HTLV-producing cell lines did not allow their growth in vivo, but some peripheral blood lymphocytes could be immortalized in vitro. One of these transformed cell lines was examined for the integration of HTLV-I provirus genome.

Light-scatter pulse-width time-of-flight, a direct and readily calibrated measure of cell diameter, was used to calculate receptor density as the average number of receptors per unit cell surface area. Cell surface TfRs were unimodally distributed over the cell population and were present throughout the cell cycle. The number of receptors increased as cells progressed through the cell cycle, but cell cycle phase was also correlated with cell volume. However, when size heterogeneity was factored out by reanalysis of listmode data, there was a clear cell-cycle effect: among cells of the same size, both the number of receptors per cell and the receptor density increased from G1 to S to G2/M. TfR expression was also followed over time in culture after dilution into fresh medium. A decrease in growth rate after four days was preceded by one to two days by a decrease in both number of TfRs per cell and mean receptor density, indicating that decreased TfR expression represented true ""down-regulation"" and not just decreased cell size or an increase in the proportion of smaller G1 cells. This type of analysis is generally applicable for resolving the effects of cell size heterogeneity and cell cycle on membrane protein distribution and for other studies of ligand-receptor interaction.","['Rudolph, N S', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm, B M', 'Leary, J F', 'Rowley, P T']","['Rudolph NS', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm BM', 'Leary JF', 'Rowley PT']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Time Factors']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990060211 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1985 Mar;6(2):151-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990060211.,"['5-T32-GM 7098/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23088/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Since it is possible that SpA dissociates from the SAC column during treatment, and that intravenous infusion of SpA could be a more efficacious form of treatment than extracorporeal immunoadsorption therapy, 6 normal cats and 15 FeLV-infected pet cats with naturally occurring leukemia or LSA were infused with SpA. No toxic effects resulting from SpA infusion were observed in the normal cats. Antitumor effects were observed in one of the eight cats with LSA and in three of the six cats with leukemia, but there were no antiviral responses. The antitumor responses were objective regressions; however, all tumors recurred.

Using potentiometric and spectroscopic measurements, we have shown that adriamycin and daunorubicin form two well-defined species with Fe(III), which can be formulated as respectively Fe(HAd)3 and Fe(HDr)3. In these formulas, HAd and HDr stand for adriamycin and daunorubicin in which the 1,4-dihydroxy-anthraquinone moiety is half-deprotonated. Both complexes are six-membered chelates. The stability constant is beta = (2.5 +/- 0.5) X 10(28) for both complexes. Interaction with DNA has been studied showing that, despite strong coordination to Fe(III), anthracyclines are able to intercalate between DNA bases pairs, releasing the metal. These complexes display antitumor activity against P 388 leukemia that compares with that of the free drug. Fe(HAd)3, unlike adriamycin, does not catalyze the flow of electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen through NADH dehydrogenase.

A new sensitive focal immunofluorescence assay employing monoclonal antibodies was used to detect foci of virus infection in live cell monolayers. Monoclonal antibodies were chosen which reacted with the challenge virus but not with the interfering virus. The results obtained confirmed some of the findings of previous workers using Moloney sarcoma virus pseudotypes as challenge viruses on mouse and nonmouse cells. In addition, SC-1 mouse cells nonproductively infected with defective spleen focus-forming virus were found to be resistant to superinfection by recombinant dual-tropic viruses. Furthermore, results indicated that interference patterns between some pairs of viruses differed in different cell types. Thus, xenotropic MuLV blocked superinfection by recombinant dual-tropic viruses in SC-1 feral mouse cells, but not in two lines of NZB mouse cells. Also, in a Mus dunii tail fibroblast cell line some unique patterns of interference were observed. One ecotropic MuLV blocked infection by two xenotropic viruses and three recombinant dual-tropic viruses. Two other ecotropic viruses blocked infection by only one of the two xenotropic viruses tested. These two ecotropic viruses also differed from each other in their ability to block the three recombinant viruses.

The FIA was performed directly on a variety of live cells in tissue culture dishes and was used successfully with C-type murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) of different tropism including ecotropic, xenotropic, amphotropic, and dual-tropic recombinant mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses. With the FIA, we were able to titrate and distinguish ecotropic Friend-MuLV and Friend-MCF viruses present in mixtures. Dual-tropic MCF viruses could be specifically detected directly in mouse cells by using MCF-specific monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies replaced the requirement for production of typical MCF cytopathic effect in mink cells for MCF virus detection, and also allowed efficient titration in mouse cells of MCF virions pseudotyped with ecotropic envelope proteins. Furthermore, by picking foci of fluorescent cells and using their cell-free viral progeny, MCF viruses were cloned from complex pseudotypic mixtures. This allowed the cloning of viruses present at low frequency in heterogeneous mixtures obtained from leukemic tissues.","['Sitbon, M', 'Nishio, J', 'Wehrly, K', 'Lodmell, D', 'Chesebro, B']","['Sitbon M', 'Nishio J', 'Wehrly K', 'Lodmell D', 'Chesebro B']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Mink/microbiology', 'Retroviridae/*analysis', 'Species Specificity']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(85)90187-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1985 Feb;141(1):110-8. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(85)90187-4.,,,,,,,,,,,

Day-2 control supernatants were capable of significantly enhancing proliferation and suppressor cell activity but were less efficient at restoring cytotoxic cell function. Day-2 supernatants from CSA-treated cultures were not able to enhance lymphoproliferation or cytotoxic cell function but did induce significant levels of suppressor cell activity.

Prolonged survival has focused attention on the quality of life and strategies to enable these children and their families to cope effectively with chronic, life-threatening illness. Research is ongoing on several fronts: to find innovative treatment approaches for children who currently have a poorer prognosis, to minimize or prevent acute and late toxicities by modifying treatment plans so less intensive treatment can be given to patients with a low risk of disease recurrence, and to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and etiology of childhood cancer. With the continued efforts of researchers in the laboratory and at the bedside, prevention of these catastrophic diseases may some day become a reality.","['Waskerwitz, M J', 'Ruccione, K']","['Waskerwitz MJ', 'Ruccione K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nurs Clin North Am,The Nursing clinics of North America,0042033,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/therapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Eye Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/therapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/therapy', 'Retinoblastoma/therapy', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/therapy']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nurs Clin North Am. 1985 Mar;20(1):5-29.,,71,,,,,,,,,

Cell lines were derived from thymomas induced by each Abelson virus complex and were classified according to normal thymus cell phenotypes. Each virus complex induced some cell lines which were like a 0.7% subpopulation of murine thymocytes in that they failed to express the Thy-1 cell-surface antigen. These lines are thus far indistinguishable from some Abelson-derived bone marrow transformants classified as pre-B cells. However, the Abelson-Moloney complex induced some cell lines which expressed low levels of Thy-1 and which shared most markers with immature blast cells of the thymic medulla, whereas the Abelson-RadLV complex induced some lines which were clearly like thymic cortex blast cells.

When the p15-deleted genome was introduced into previously transformed lymphoid lines, its protein product exhibited a marked instability. The tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation activity per cell was less than 1/20th that of the nondeleted protein. Although pulse-Ia-beling showed that the p15-deleted protein was synthesized efficiently, immunoblotting demonstrated that its steady-state level was less than 1/10th that of the nondeleted Abelson protein. The specific instability of the p15-deleted protein in lymphoid cells explains the requirement of these sequences for lymphoid but not fibroblast transformation.","['Prywes, R', 'Hoag, J', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Baltimore, D']","['Prywes R', 'Hoag J', 'Rosenberg N', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.54.1.123-132.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Apr;54(1):123-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.54.1.123-132.1985.,"['CA24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC254769,,,,,,,

Of 15 hydroxyl radical scavengers tested, 13 inhibited lysis. These were not toxic, because cell morphology and spontaneous chromium release were not affected and preculture with scavengers was not inhibitory. These scavengers differed widely in structure, but degree of inhibition of lysis correlated with their rate constants (k) for reaction with hydroxyl radical (k vs log inhibitor concentration required to decrease lysis by 50%: r = -0.9202, p less than 0.001), showing that inhibition was due to inactivation of the hydroxyl radical. Target cell binding was not reduced at concentrations that inhibited lysis. Inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway also decreased lysis, suggesting this pathway to be the source of hydroxyl radicals.

The sialic acid residues of the TfR glycoprotein were used to monitor transport to the Golgi complex, the site of sialyltransferases. Surface-labeled cells were treated with neuraminidase, and readdition of sialic acid residues, monitored by isoelectric focusing of immunoprecipitated TfR, was used to assess the movement of receptor to sialyltransferase-containing compartments. Asialo-TfR was resialylated by the cells with a half-time of 2-3 h. Resialylation occurred in an intracellular organelle, since it was inhibited by treatments that allow internalization of surface components but block transfer out of the endosomal compartment. Moreover, roughly half of the resialylated molecules were cleaved when cells were retreated with neuraminidase after culturing, indicating that this fraction of the molecules had returned to the cell surface. These results suggest that TfR is transported from the cell surface to the Golgi complex, the intracellular site of sialyltransferases, and then returns to the cell surface. This pathway, which has not been previously described for a cell surface receptor, may be different from the route followed by TfR in iron uptake, since reported rates of transferrin uptake and release are significantly more rapid than the resialylation of asialo-TfR.","['Snider, M D', 'Rogers, O C']","['Snider MD', 'Rogers OC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Endocytosis', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Transferrin/pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.100.3.826 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1985 Mar;100(3):826-34. doi: 10.1083/jcb.100.3.826.,['GM-31375/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2113516,,,,,,,

Detailed mapping of the DNase I-hypersensitive region revealed four strong cutting sites within a 500-base pair segment immediately upstream from the DHFR coding sequence and a weak cutting site within intron I. Two of the strong DNase I cutting sites in chromatin were also sensitive to S1 nuclease nicking when this DNA fragment was part of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Promoter undermethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity, features previously shown for specialized and inducible genes, have now been shown to be characteristic of the constitutively expressed DHFR gene. That these features characterize all copies of the amplified DHFR gene in a methotrexate-resistant cell line suggest that all gene copies are transcriptionally active.","['Shimada, T', 'Nienhuis, A W']","['Shimada T', 'Nienhuis AW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', '*Gene Amplification', 'HeLa Cells/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/analysis', 'Methylation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics']",1985/02/25 00:00,1985/02/25 00:01,['1985/02/25 00:00'],"['1985/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89577-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Feb 25;260(4):2468-74.,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of these was purified by biological cloning and examined for its envelope properties and leukemogenicity. Both the e- and the RM-MuLV's were single isolates and unique in terms of their neutralization profiles and peptide maps. The cloned e-Gi-MuLV was highly leukemogenic in C57Bl mice, inducing a very rapid lethal thymic lymphoma but no myeloid leukemia. e-Gi-MuLV also accelerated thymic lymphoma in AKR mice. The purified RM-MuLV did not induce any tumors. Infectious cell center (ICC) experiments of organs of mice inoculated with e-Gi-MuLV showed that virus replicated very rapidly and reached maximal titers in about one week in C57Bl mice. There was a highly preferential replication in the thymus of the animal so that this e-Gi-MuLV can be considered as thymotropic. Within two weeks after infection of mice, infected cells of the thymus also began to release low levels of a non-ecotropic MuLV. The rapid induction of lymphoma is compared to that induced by other e-MuLV's and their RM-MuLV's, and to the natural AKR-MuLV-associated disease. These findings are discussed in the context of prevailing theories on envelope gene rearrangements in the virus and in the proviral sequences in resulting tumors.","['Fischinger, P J', 'Dunlop, N M', 'Robey, W G']","['Fischinger PJ', 'Dunlop NM', 'Robey WG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(85)90145-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(85)90145-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1985 Feb;11(2):241-51. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(85)90145-2.,,,,,,,,,,,

The present findings are based on multiple surveys, using each assay technique at least twice. Although Niigata Prefecture has been considered a non-endemic region for HTLV-I, Sado Island has been proven by this study to be a relatively endemic pocket within this non-endemic area. Seropositivity was highest in residents of Sado Island; 97/1, 117 (8.7%) by IFM and 33/1,061 (3.1%) by ELISA; followed by Niigata City, 18/650 (2.8%) by IFM and 16/638 (2.5%) by ELISA; and lowest in the remaining areas, 57/2,631 (2.2%) by IFM and 20/2,551 (0.8%) by ELISA. Seropositivity was demonstrated in 172/4,398 (3.9%) by IFM and 69/4,250 (1.6%) by ELISA in Niigata Prefecture taken as a whole. In general, the incidence of seropositive residents increased gradually with age. The sex difference was not significant. The serum samples tested were categorized into 4 groups; (1) IFM and ELISA both positive, (2) IFM positive but ELISA negative, (3) IFM negative but ELISA positive, and (4) IFM and ELISA both negative. By absorption tests, IFM and ELISA seemed to recognize different specific antibodies in sera; IFM recognized antibodies to HTLV-I-related cellular antigens in addition to HTLV-I viral antigens, but ELISA recognized antibodies to HTLV-I viral antigens alone. Thus, IFM detected a broader spectrum of antigens, resulting in recognition of more positive sera than those detected by ELISA.","['Aoki, T', 'Miyakoshi, H', 'Koide, H', 'Yoshida, T', 'Ishikawa, H', 'Sugisaki, Y', 'Mizukoshi, M', 'Tamura, K', 'Misawa, H', 'Hamada, C']","['Aoki T', 'Miyakoshi H', 'Koide H', 'Yoshida T', 'Ishikawa H', 'Sugisaki Y', 'Mizukoshi M', 'Tamura K', 'Misawa H', 'Hamada C', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Carrier State/epidemiology/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Disease Reservoirs', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/immunology']",1985/03/15 00:00,1985/03/15 00:01,['1985/03/15 00:00'],"['1985/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910350304 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Mar 15;35(3):301-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910350304.,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, all lines responded by enhanced proliferation to supernatants from a BCGF-producing T-cell hybridoma. Not all lines, however, displayed autostimulation to their own supernatants and no tumor B-cell line appeared totally dependent on soluble factors for its growth. Non-tumorigenic B-cell lines, by contrast, revealed a strict dependency on homologous growth factor for their continued proliferation in suspension culture.

In vitro, the three RSV isolates tested induced erythroblast-like colonies in infected bone marrow cells that were distinguishable by size and cell arrangement from those induced by avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV). Also in contrast to AEV-transformed erythroblast cultures, isolated cell colonies induced by RSV required complex growth conditions in liquid medium similar to the in vitro conditions necessary for erythroblasts transformed by the acute leukemia virus E26. Temperature-shift experiments using temperature-sensitive (ts) NY68 RSV revealed that when grown at the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees), mutant-infected cells became benzidine positive and partially differentiated into erythrocytes. Wild-type (wt) RSV-transformed cells did not undergo similar changes. However, both wt RSV-, and to a greater extent, ts RSV-transformed cultures at the permissive temperature (37 degrees) did contain populations of spontaneously differentiating erythroid cells signifying that the transforming activity of the virus did not fully arrest erythroid maturation. In addition, the RSV-transformed cells did express tyrosine kinase activity. When injected intravenously into birds, RSV induced an erythroblastosis-like disease similar to AEV but also caused fibrosarcomas and leg paralysis. These results show that RSV can alter the pattern of erythroid differentiation in a manner similar to, but distinct from, AEV and indicate that the tyrosine-specific pp60src kinase is involved in erythroid cell transformation.

To determine whether the c-mos oncogene has been translocated in AML-M2 with this translocation and to isolate DNA sequences and genes from these two chromosomes that may be important in malignancy, we constructed somatic cell hybrids between a Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) mutant defective in glycine metabolism and myeloblasts with an 8;21 translocation from a patient with AML. We isolated the 21q+ chromosome of this translocation in a somatic cell hybrid and showed that the c-mos oncogene had not been translocated to chromosome 21, ruling out the possibility that translocation of c-mos to chromosome 21 is necessary for development of AML-M2. In addition, there was no detectable rearrangement of the c-mos locus within a 12.4-kilobase region surrounding the gene, indicating that rearrangement of the coding region of the gene itself or alteration of proximal 5' or 3' flanking sequences is not involved. We used this hybrid to determine whether specific DNA sequences and biochemical markers from chromosomes 8 and 21 had been translocated in this case.","['Drabkin, H A', 'Diaz, M', 'Bradley, C M', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rowley, J D', 'Patterson, D']","['Drabkin HA', 'Diaz M', 'Bradley CM', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD', 'Patterson D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endodeoxyribonuclease SacI)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI', '*Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Ovary/analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.2.464 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jan;82(2):464-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.2.464.,"['AG00029/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD13432/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC397059,,,,,,,

To establish further the significance of this lesion and its relationship to the subsequent development of lymphomas, we have compared the incidence of transformed follicles observed in animals susceptible or resistant to ALV-induced tumor development. During the 8 weeks following ALV infection, transformed follicles were detected in 82% of the susceptible animals and in 11% of the resistant animals.

These cells present a normal phenotype at 39 degrees C and a transformed phenotype at 28 or 33 degrees C, expressing two viral proteins, termed P85gag-mos and P58gag, at 28 to 33 degrees C, whereas only P58gag is expressed at 39 degrees C. It has been previously shown that 6m2 cells contain two virus-specific RNA species, a 4.0-kilobase (kb) RNA coding for P58gag and a 3.5-kb RNA coding for P85gag-mos. Using both Northern blot and S1 nuclease analyses, we show here that the 3.5-kb RNA is the predominant viral RNA species in 6m2 cells grown at 28 degrees C, whereas only the 4.0-kb RNA is detected at 39 degrees C. During temperature shift experiments, the 3.5-kb RNA species disappears after a shift from 28 to 39 degrees C and is detected again after a shift back from 39 to 28 degrees C. By Southern blot analysis, we have detected only one ts110 proviral DNA in the 6m2 genome. This observation, as well as previously published heteroduplex and S1 nuclease analyses which showed that the 3.5-kb RNA species lacks about 430 bases found at the gag gene-mos gene junction in the 4.0-kb RNA, suggests that the 3.5-kb RNA is a splicing product of the 4.0-kb RNA. The absence of the 3.5-kb RNA when 6m2 cells are grown at 39 degrees C indicates that the splicing reaction is thermosensitive. The splicing defect of the ts110 Moloney murine sarcoma virus viral RNA in 6m2 cells cannot be complemented by acute Moloney murine leukemia virus superinfection, since no 3.5-kb ts110 RNA was detected in acutely superinfected 6m2 cells maintained at 39 degrees C. The spliced Moloney murine leukemia virus env mRNA, however, is found in acutely infected cells maintained at 39 degrees C, suggesting that the lack of ts110 viral RNA splicing at 39 degrees C is not due to an obvious host defect. In sharp contrast, however, 6m2 cells chronically superinfected with Moloney murine leukemia virus produce a 3.5-kb RNA species at 39 degrees C as well as at 28 degrees C and contain proviral DNAs corresponding to the two viral RNA species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hamelin, R', 'Brizzard, B L', 'Nash, M A', 'Murphy, E C Jr', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Hamelin R', 'Brizzard BL', 'Nash MA', 'Murphy EC Jr', 'Arlinghaus RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag', '*Genes, Viral', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Oncogenes', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Temperature', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1985/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.53.2.616-623.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Feb;53(2):616-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.53.2.616-623.1985.,"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36714/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC254677,,,,,,,

This is the first report to show that HTLV expression in T lymphocytes cultured in vitro is inversely proportional to constitutive gamma interferon production. Of 16 fresh T lymphocyte cultures established from patients with mature T lymphocyte neoplasias, 3 were grown continuously for over 3 years and 13 were grown for 2 to 8 months in culture. Of the 16 cultures, 9 were HTLVp19 positive and interferon negative, whereas the remaining 7 were HTLVp19 negative or weakly positive and also interferon positive (12 to 105 U/ml). The prototype HTLV-positive T-cell line (HUT102) was examined over a long-term culture and after selective cell cloning for high virus yield. Results indicate that early-passage, low-HTLV-producing HUT102 cells constitutively produced significant levels of gamma-immune interferon. In late-passage and cloned HUT102 cells, an increase in HTLV production was concordant with a decrease in constitutive interferon production and the loss of mature T lymphocyte antigens. Transformation of human umbilical cord blood lymphocytes by HTLV was possible only after cocultivation with the non-interferon, high virus-producing, cloned HUT102 T lymphocytes. The inverse relationship between interferon and HTLV production was also observed when normal human umbilical cord blood and adult T lymphocytes were transformed by HTLV and maintained in culture.","['Moore, J L', 'Poiesz, B J', 'Zamkoff, K W', 'Merl, S A', 'Hanna, S', 'Gazdar, A F', 'Comis, R L']","['Moore JL', 'Poiesz BJ', 'Zamkoff KW', 'Merl SA', 'Hanna S', 'Gazdar AF', 'Comis RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Retroviridae Infections/*blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*microbiology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.53.2.440-446.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Feb;53(2):440-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.53.2.440-446.1985.,,,,PMC254655,,,,,,,

Incubation of radioactively labelled Gz-p65gag in the presence of unlabelled Mo-MuLV under optimal conditions resulted in the cleavage of Gz-p65gag to proteins of 40000 (P40) and 25000 (P25) Mr. P40 and P25 appeared to be similar in both mobility and antigenicity to Mo-MuLV intermediates, Pr40gag and Pr25gag, previously found in infected cells. Additional proteins of 30000 (Gz-p30), 15000 (Gz-p12), 12000 (Gz-p15) and 10000 (Gzp10) Mr were also generated upon cleavage of Gz-p65gag and contained antigenic determinants of Mo-MuLV structural proteins p30, pp12, p15 and p10, respectively. Both detergent-disrupted Mo-MuLV and Rauscher murine leukaemia virus produced similar cleavage profiles. Trypsin and detergent-disrupted mouse mammary tumour virus generated cleavage patterns very different from that produced by Mo-MuLV. Both visual and quantitative time studies of the reaction indicated that P40 gave rise to Gz-p30 and Gz-p10. Tryptic peptide mapping of Gz-p65gag and its cleavage products supported the results obtained from both immunoprecipitation studies with anti-gag sera and the kinetics of cleavage of Gz-p65gag. Both Mo-MuLV Pr65gag and Gz-p65gag were found to be very similar in primary sequence as judged by peptide mapping. P40 produced tryptic peptides that co-migrated with Mo-MuLV p30 peptides; P25 contained tryptic peptides that were also found in Mo-MuLV p15. Gz-p30 and Gz-p15 contained the tryptic peptides of Mo-MuLV p30 and p15, respectively, that were found in P40 and P25. The Gz-p10 fraction contained a tryptic peptide that was also found in P40, but not p30.

Implications for the role of interleukin 2 in human B cell function.,181-97,"In the present study, we examined the expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors on normal human B cells as well as established B cell lines. Anti-Tac monoclonal antibody did not bind to freshly separated normal human B cells. Unexpectedly, with the appropriate activation of the normal B cells by anti-mu antibody, phorbol myristate acetate, or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC), Tac antigen was induced on the activated B cells. Anti-Tac antibody showed consistent reactivity with two B cell lines that were infected by human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and some reactivity with two out of eight Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines established from normal adult donors. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that antigens of similar size with a molecular weight of 50,000-60,000 can be precipitated with anti-Tac antibody from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal T cell blasts and normal activated B cells, as well as a cloned B cell line. Binding assays of IL-2 on normal activated B cells and on the cloned B cell (HS1) revealed that B cells have significantly fewer sites and lower-affinity IL-2 receptors compared with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal T cell blasts. Finally, biological properties of the IL-2 receptor on B cells were examined by incubating B cells with recombinant IL-2. It was found that moderate concentrations of IL-2 induce significant enhancement of proliferation and differentiation in SAC-activated normal B cells. These results suggest that normal B cells may express functional IL-2 receptors or closely related proteins and thus IL-2 may play a significant role in the modulation of B cell function.","['Muraguchi, A', 'Kehrl, J H', 'Longo, D L', 'Volkman, D J', 'Smith, K A', 'Fauci, A S']","['Muraguchi A', 'Kehrl JH', 'Longo DL', 'Volkman DJ', 'Smith KA', 'Fauci AS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism/physiology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.161.1.181 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Jan 1;161(1):181-97. doi: 10.1084/jem.161.1.181.,,,,PMC2187555,,,,,,,

For each enzyme, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics in various immunologically defined subclasses of acute leukaemia are described. The quantitative evaluation of enzyme activities represents an adjunctive classification technique which should be incorporated into the multivariate analysis, the ""multiple marker analysis."" By qualitative characterisation pronounced heterogeneity of leukaemia subsets is uncovered. The application of 2'-deoxycoformycin, a specific inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, and the potential usefulness of two other enzymes as targets for treatment with selective agents is discussed. The concept that gene products expressed at certain developmental stages of normal cells can similarly be detected in leukaemic cells (which therefore seem to be ""frozen"" or ""arrested"" at this particular maturation/differentiation stage) is supported by the results obtained in enzyme studies.

Exogenous iron concentration in culture was manipulated by supplementing the medium with sera having different iron concentrations over the range 0.6 to 5.4 micrograms/ml, by the addition of iron in the form of FeCl3, iron-saturated serum, or diferric transferrin, and by the addition of the iron chelator Desferal (desferrioxamine). TfR expression was negatively correlated with exogenous iron content: any treatment that reduced exogenous iron supply by at least 15% resulted in as much as a 1.8-fold increase in external receptors, detected as binding by both transferrin and monoclonal anti-TfR antibodies, and a 1.5-fold increase in the pool of internal receptors, as detected by anti-TfR antibody binding. None of these treatments altered growth rate, total cellular protein content, protein synthetic rate, cell cycle distribution or cell size. The rapid (12 hr) and reversible induction of internal and external receptors by Desferal was inhibited by cycloheximide and therefore may have resulted from de novo synthesis and not just mobilization of internal receptor pool to the cell surface.

Co-cultivation of lymphocytes from the 2 other seroconverters with lymphocytes from 2 anti-HTLV-negative healthy men gave rise to the establishment of an HTLV-producing T-cell line derived from each individual. Blood transfusion from one of the HTLV-infected rabbits into 2 female rabbits also resulted in the seroconversion of both recipients. An HTLV-carrying lymphoid cell line (Ra-2) was established from one of the transfusion-related seroconverters. The Ra-2 cell line was initially TCGF-dependent but later became TCGF-independent.

Amsalem cells are unique in that they possess antigenic determinants associated with the E-receptor, yet fail to form rosettes with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Amsalem cells were found to possess morphological and cytochemical features characteristic of T-lymphocytes, and were sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of rabbit antisera specific for T-cell antigens. In immunofluorescent tests with monoclonal antibodies, Amsalem cells showed a strong reactivity with the OKT-11A and A-22 antibodies, specific for the E-receptor. The cells were reactive with OKT-4 and showed a very weak reactivity with OKT-6 and OKT-8. No reactivity was found with the OKT-3, Leu 7, Leu 11, and OKM1 antibodies. Amsalem cells failed to form rosettes with SRBC; however, mouse anti-Amsalem serum inhibited the formation of E-rosettes.

Neonatal CFW/D mice were given an intrathymic injection of an endogenous virus (DMBA-LV) isolated from a DMBA-induced thymic lymphoma.

A third group (group 3) consisted of lymphomas with a mixture of an abnormal stem line and sidelines. Chromosome analysis of cultures at subsequent times showed that there were fluctuations in the proportion of cells characterized as either stem line or sideline in all tumors at different times during culture. The initial sideline in group 1 tumors had a diploid complement. Although the proportion of the diploid cells increased in 5 of the 6 tumors following either 24 or 48 hr in culture, cells with a diploid karyotype remained as a sideline throughout the culture period. Similarly, the two tumors analyzed in group 2 showed that the initial sideline that contained trisomy 15 increased temporarily to become the stem line following 6 or 12 hr in culture. Group 3 tumors showed a slight variation in the proportion of cells with an abnormal stem line or sideline during culture. Considering all the data from the 10 tumors, 7 tumors had cells with a diploid karyotype, and, although the proportion of cells with this karyotype increased (4 tumors) or persisted (3 tumors) during 48 hr in culture, it remained as a sideline and was not overgrown by trisomy 15 stem line.","['Chan, F P', 'Ball, J K']","['Chan FP', 'Ball JK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Ploidies', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Trisomy']",1985/01/15 00:00,1985/01/15 00:01,['1985/01/15 00:00'],"['1985/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(85)90196-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(85)90196-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1985 Jan 15;14(3-4):303-11. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(85)90196-7.,,,,,,,,,,,
