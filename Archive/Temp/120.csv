Peripheral blood samples from 27 patients after hiBMT were harvested and the percentage and absolute counts of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were detected by flow cytometry. The correlations of GVHD occurrence and disease relapse with the reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were analyzed. The results showed that the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells of peripheral blood samples increased significantly after G-CSF priming. At day 30 after hiBMT, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were recovered to the 20% of normal level, followed by a slowly process in 3 months, and up to one half of the normal level at 180 days. There was no evidence to prove relationship between CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells and acute GVHD, while CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were increased significantly in the chronic GVHD group. The absolute count of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells showed no relations with relapse of leukemia during the first year after hiBMT. In conclusions, chronic but not acute GVHD was in relation to the reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells based on the anti-CD25 antibody therapy model for the prevention of GVHD after hiBMT. Further investigation is needed to clarify whether the relapse of leukemia after hiBMT is related to the reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells.","['Duan, Lian-Nng', 'Ding, Li', 'Yan, Hong-Min', 'Xue, Mei', 'Liu, Jing', 'Zhu, Ling', 'Wang, Heng-Xiang', 'Ji, Shu-Quan']","['Duan LN', 'Ding L', 'Yan HM', 'Xue M', 'Liu J', 'Zhu L', 'Wang HX', 'Ji SQ']","['Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital of Chinese PLA, Beijing 100036, China. duanln@tom.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)'],IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/surgery']",2010/02/09 06:00,2011/10/07 06:00,['2010/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)01-0177-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Feb;18(1):177-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major end points of study included overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse rate and transplantation related mortality (TRM). The results showed that 3-year OS and DFS of the study population reached to 58.4% and 53.9% respectively, and the relapse rate and TRM leaded to 16.9% and 29.9% respectively. Incidence of acute GVHD was 59.6%, with 18.7% II-IV aGVHD. Different prognosis was observed between HSCT recipients of alternative donor and HLA-matched related donor (MRD) (3-year DFS was 34.3% vs 60.0%, p = 0.019), between patients of refractory leukemia and the control (3-year DFS was 35.7% vs 58.2%, p = 0.048), between recipients with and without severe aGVHD (3-year DFS was 35.7% vs 54.4%, p = 0.059). Further analysis revealed significantly high TRM in recipients receiving allo-HSCT of alternative donor (p = 0.033) and high rate of severe aGVHD (p = 0.010). Multivariate analysis revealed three negative prognostic factors: donor availability (alternative vs MRD) (p = 0.049, RR = 2.09, 95%CI 1.01 - 4.36), refractory leukemia (p = 0.038, RR = 2.33, 95%CI 1.05 - 5.20) and severe aGVHD (p = 0.040, RR = 2.33, 95%CI 1.04 - 5.20). It is concluded that allo-HSCT is a choice for the AML case at complete remission and TRM is the major cause of the transplantation failure.

On the basis of initial leukocyte count and prognostic factors, patients enrolled in this study were divided into three risk groups (early relapse, high leukocyte count and standard risk groups). The proteins of leukemic cells from patients at diagnosis were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot detection, quantification and alignment were performed with the PDQuest 7.3.0 image analysis software. Differentially expressed spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry for peptide mass finger (PMF) data. The results showed that the significant difference of protein expression profile existed in 3 groups of childhood TEL/AML1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Compared with the high leukocyte count and standard risk groups, 71 protein spots disappeared; 93 new protein spots were found; 37 protein spot expressions were up-regulated; 23 protein spots were down-regulated in early relapse group. Compared the high leukocyte count group, 6 protein spots disappeared, 56 new protein spots were found, 7 protein spot expression were up-regulated, 19 protein spot expressions were down-regulated in standard risk group. The identification of 40 differential protein spots by using mass spectrometry revealed some proteins in 3 groups such as tropomyosin, lactotransferrin, lactate dehydrogenase A, CRMP1 protein, alphaenolase, AKR1B1, calnexin precursor, heat shock protein (HSP86/HSP89/HSP90), annexin VI, G22P1 and so on. Among them the HSP86/HSP89/HSP90 highly expressed only in early reapse group, the lactotransferrin, alphenolase and G22P1 expressions were up-regulated in early relapse group. It is concluded that the protein expression in early relapse group is significant different from the others. Some proteins may be further used in research on leukemia mechanisms. In addition, these analyses may promote the identification of new targets for individualized treatment approaches.","['Guo, Ye', 'Fan, Bao-Li', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Hu, Ying', 'Zou, Yao', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Guo Y', 'Fan BL', 'Chen YM', 'Hu Y', 'Zou Y', 'Chen XJ', 'Zhang L', 'Zhu XF']","['Diagnostic and Therapeutic Center for Childhoood Hematologic Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjing 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proteome']",2010/02/09 06:00,2011/10/07 06:00,['2010/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)01-0116-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Feb;18(1):116-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last two decades, sequential changes to the approach to HCT have resulted in reduced regimen-related toxicity, superior engraftment and less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in improved survival. The two pivotal changes that most influenced these improvements were the addition of fludarabine to the preparative regimen to augment engraftment, and the use of T cell depletion to reduce GVHD. With these improved HCT outcomes, indications for HCT are quite consistent regardless of donor source. Emphasis is now being placed on developing HCT regimens that will improve quality of life by reducing late effects, particularly the risk of malignancy, sterility and endocrinopathies.

In general, LIF engages a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of a low-affinity LIF receptor (LIFRbeta) and gp130, and activates STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3) and ERKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinases). However, in undifferentiated ES cells in the presence of LIF, STAT3 is phosphorylated but ERKs are not. The removal of LIF-induced dephosphorylation of phospho-STAT3 and phosphorylation of ERKs resulted in the differentiation of ES cells. Here, we show that the dephosphorylation of phospho-STAT3 corresponds to the activation of ERKs pathway from the time-courses of the phosphorylation levels in detail. We found that the treatment of membrane-permeable STAT3IP (STAT3 inhibitory peptide), which inhibits homodimeric formation of STAT3, induced the phosphorylation of ERKs in ES cells in the presence of LIF. In addition, the removal of LIF decreased the expression level of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3), a negative regulator of LIF signalling, and the phosphorylation of ERKs was efficiently induced in the ES cells where SOCS3 was down-regulated. These results suggested that LIF-induced SOCS3 suppressed the ERKs activation pathway in undifferentiated ES cells, and the down-regulation of SOCS3 by the removal of LIF triggered the phosphorylation of ERKs.","['Miyazu, Sakiko', 'Furuno, Tadahide', 'Nakanishi, Mamoru']","['Miyazu S', 'Furuno T', 'Nakanishi M']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Mizuhoku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flavonoids/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/metabolism']",2010/02/09 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20090466 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20090466 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Biol Int. 2010 Mar 29;34(5):485-92. doi: 10.1042/CBI20090466.,10.1042/CBI20090466 [doi],20100329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen septin genes have been characterized to date (SEPT1 to SEPT14) in humans. Septins have been reported to be misregulated in various human diseases, including neurological disorders, infection, and neoplasia. In this review, we describe what is known thus far about septin deregulation in myeloid neoplasia. Septin abnormalities in myeloid neoplasia can be divided into two major groups. First, some septins (SEPT2, SEPT5, SEPT6, SEPT9, and SEPT11) have been repeatedly identified as in-frame fusion partners of the MLL gene in de novo and therapy-related myeloid neoplasia, in both children and adults. Second, deregulation of the expression of septin family genes in hematological cancers can be observed either with or without the concomitant presence of MLL gene fusions. Although current hypotheses regarding the roles of septins in oncogenesis remain speculative for the most part, the fundamental roles of septins in cytokinesis, membrane remodeling, and compartmentalization can provide some clues on how abnormalities in the septin cytoskeleton could be involved in neo-plastic disorders.","['Cerveira, Nuno', 'Santos, Joana', 'Teixeira, Manuel R']","['Cerveira N', 'Santos J', 'Teixeira MR']","['Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida, 4200-072 Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism']",2010/02/09 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1aaaaf156ec9f641,77cb72336378eb40 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.v15.i1-2.40 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2009;15(1-2):91-115. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.v15.i1-2.40.,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For elderly patients who only receive palliative treatment, the median survival is only 2-3 months. Inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor family is one of the therapeutic strategies that are considered in AML. NF-kappaB is an important regulator of several biological processes that are involved in leukemogenesis, including proliferation, differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation has been detected in AML cells and NF-kappaB inhibition is therefore a possible therapeutic strategy in AML. Multiple pharmacological agents have shown inhibitory effects against NF-kappaB signaling pathways, including proteasome inhibitors as well as the more-specific agents that are directed against various steps of this signaling pathway. Recent studies strongly suggest that primary human AML cells (including AML stem cells) are susceptible to NF-kappaB inhibition, but this therapeutic approach should possibly be combined with other therapeutic agents to achieve a combined effect both on NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, tumor suppressor-induced signaling, and stress-induced pathways. The clinical documentation with regard to the efficiency and safety of NF-kappaB inhibition is still limited, but experimental evidence strongly suggests that NF-kappaB inhibition should be further investigated in human AML.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Olsnes, Astrid Marta', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Ersvar, Elisabeth', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Olsnes AM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Ersvar E', 'Bruserud O']","['Division for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2010/02/09 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1aaaaf156ec9f641,0ec1b8dd079de327 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.v15.i1-2.10 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2009;15(1-2):1-41. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.v15.i1-2.10.,,,184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, we highlight the controversial significance of silent candiduria, clinical relevance of which should be investigated case by case, to exclude and/or prevent candiduria as well as renal impairment.","['Savini, Vincenzo', 'Catavitello, Chiara', 'Di Marzio, Ilaria', 'Masciarelli, Gioviana', 'Astolfi, Daniela', 'Balbinot, Andrea', 'Bianco, Azaira', 'Pompilio, Arianna', 'Di Bonaventura, Giovanni', ""D'Amario, Claudio"", ""D'Antonio, Domenico""]","['Savini V', 'Catavitello C', 'Di Marzio I', 'Masciarelli G', 'Astolfi D', 'Balbinot A', 'Bianco A', 'Pompilio A', 'Di Bonaventura G', ""D'Amario C"", ""D'Antonio D""]",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Letter']",Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Azoles)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azoles/*pharmacology', 'Candida/classification/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/*complications/microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Urine/*microbiology']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11046-010-9278-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2010 Jun;169(6):457-9. doi: 10.1007/s11046-010-9278-5.

The association of a lack of expression of ZAP70 with an immunodeficiency consisting in a markedly reduced T lymphocyte-mediated immunity highlighted the crucial role of this tyrosine kinase in T cell development and function. This discovery was soon accompanied by the characterization of the substrates of ZAP70 and the signalling cascades that depend on ZAP70 activity. These studies demonstrated that ZAP70 was indeed at the crossroad of several signalling pathways that control T lymphocyte development and function. Recently, a revival of interest for this protein came again from studies associating abnormal ZAP70 expression with pathological conditions. Some chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells were shown to express ZAP70, and this expression was correlated with bad prognosis. Mouse models also revealed that partial defects in ZAP70 activity can be associated with autoimmunity. These last results suggested that ZAP70 is involved in the fine balance between immunity and tolerance. In this review, we will discuss the role of ZAP70 in T cell activation and focus on what we learnt from pathological conditions associated with defective expression or activity of the ZAP70 kinase.","['Fischer, Alain', 'Picard, Capucine', 'Chemin, Karine', 'Dogniaux, Stephanie', 'le Deist, Francoise', 'Hivroz, Claire']","['Fischer A', 'Picard C', 'Chemin K', 'Dogniaux S', 'le Deist F', 'Hivroz C']","['INSERM, U768, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Semin Immunopathol,Seminars in immunopathology,101308769,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00281-010-0196-x [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Immunopathol. 2010 Jun;32(2):107-16. doi: 10.1007/s00281-010-0196-x.

However, patients with D835 mutations did not show differences in RFS or overall survival (OS). Moreover, patients with initial normalized copy number (NCN) of PML-RARalpha transcripts less than the 25(th) percentile had adverse clinical features and shorter 5-year RFS (P<0.0001) and OS (P=0.004) compared to patients with higher NCN. Patients with low NCN showed increased incidence of ITDs (P=0.001), with higher ratios (P<0.0001) and/or longer sizes (P=0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that long FLT3-ITD (P=0.001), low PML-RARalpha levels (P=0.004) and elevated WBC counts (>10x10(9)/L) (P=0.018) were independent predictors for shorter RFS. We identified a subgroup of patients with high WBC, long FLT3-ITD and low NCN of transcripts that showed an extremely bad prognosis (5-year RFS 23.4%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FLT3-ITD size and PML-RARalpha transcript levels at diagnosis could contribute to improve the risk stratification in APL.","['Chillon, Maria Carmen', 'Santamaria, Carlos', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Balanzategui, Ana', 'Sarasquete, Maria Eugenia', 'Alcoceba, Miguel', 'Marin, Luis', 'Caballero, Maria Dolores', 'Vidriales, Maria Belen', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Bernal, Teresa', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, Joaquin', 'Garcia de Coca, Alfonso', 'Penarrubia, Maria Jesus', 'Queizan, Jose Antonio', 'Giraldo, Pilar', 'San Miguel, Jesus F', 'Gonzalez, Marcos']","['Chillon MC', 'Santamaria C', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Balanzategui A', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Alcoceba M', 'Marin L', 'Caballero MD', 'Vidriales MB', 'Ramos F', 'Bernal T', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Garcia de Coca A', 'Penarrubia MJ', 'Queizan JA', 'Giraldo P', 'San Miguel JF', 'Gonzalez M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, Salamanca, 37007, Spain. chillon@usal.es']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2010/02/06 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.015073 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.015073 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 May;95(5):745-51. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.015073.

Induction of SYK in an ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system results in STAT3 activation, as documented by tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, as well as amplified expression of several STAT3 target genes. STAT3 activation after oxidative stress (OS) is strongly diminished in DT40 chicken B-lineage lymphoma cells rendered SYK-deficient by targeted disruption of the syk gene. Introduction of a wild-type, C-terminal or N-terminal SH2 domain-mutated, but not a kinase domain-mutated, syk gene into SYK-deficient DT40 cells restores OS-induced enhancement of STAT-3 activity. Thus, SYK plays an important and indispensable role in OS-induced STAT3 activation and its catalytic SH1 domain is critical for this previously unknown regulatory function. These results provide evidence for the existence of a novel mode of cytokine-independent cross-talk that operates between SYK and STAT3 pathways and regulates apoptosis during OS. We further provide experimental evidence that SYK is capable of associating with and phosphorylating STAT3 in human B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cells challenged with OS. In agreement with a prerequisite role of SYK in OS-induced STAT3 activation, OS does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in SYK-deficient human proB leukemia cells. Notably, inhibition of SYK with a small molecule drug candidate prevents OS-induced activation of STAT3 and overcomes the resistance of human B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cells to OS-induced apoptosis.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Ma, Hong', 'Tuel-Ahlgren, Lisa', 'Ozer, Zahide']","['Uckun FM', 'Qazi S', 'Ma H', 'Tuel-Ahlgren L', 'Ozer Z']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Childrens Hospital, P.O.

The underlying molecular mechanisms for this regulation remain ill-defined. With U937-PR9 cell lines stably expressing luciferase reporter gene under the control of different mutants of the TF promoter, both luciferase and ChIP data allowed the localization of the PML/RARalpha-responsive sequence in a previously undefined region of the TF promoter at position -230 to -242 devoid of known mammalian transcription factor binding sites. Within this sequence a GAGC motif (-235 to -238) was shown to be crucial because deletion or mutation of these nucleotides impaired both PML/RARalpha interaction and promoter transactivation. However, EMSA results showed that PML/RARalpha did not bind to DNA probes encompassing the -230 to -242 sequences, precluding a direct DNA association. Mutational experiments further suggest that the activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites of the TF promoter are dispensable for PML/RARalpha regulation. This study shows that PML/RARalpha transactivates the TF promoter through an indirect interaction with an element composed of a GAGC motif and the flanking nucleotides, independent of AP-1 binding.","['Yan, Jinsong', 'Wang, Kankan', 'Dong, Leiming', 'Liu, Hongchen', 'Chen, Weiqin', 'Xi, Wenda', 'Ding, Qiulan', 'Kieffer, Nelly', 'Caen, Jacques P', 'Chen, Saijuan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Xi, Xiaodong']","['Yan J', 'Wang K', 'Dong L', 'Liu H', 'Chen W', 'Xi W', 'Ding Q', 'Kieffer N', 'Caen JP', 'Chen S', 'Chen Z', 'Xi X']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coagulation Protein Disorders/etiology/*genetics', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Thromboplastin/*genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['0915006107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0915006107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Feb 23;107(8):3716-21. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0915006107.

In this study, the protein expression of CT45 was examined in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas and classical Hodgkin lymphoma by immunohistochemical analysis. Serological response to CT45 was also evaluated by ELISA using CT45 recombinant protein and sera from patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. None of the 80 low-grade B-cell lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, expressed CT45. In comparison, CT45 was expressed in 28 of 126 (22%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). A remarkably high percentage (42/72, 58%) of classical Hodgkin lymphoma contained CT45-positive Reed-Sternberg cells. Nodular sclerosis and mixed-cellularity subtypes had similar frequency of CT45 expression, but most EBV-positive cases were CT45 negative. Gray-zone lymphoma (cases with features of both DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma) also showed frequent (64%) CT45 expression. Evaluation of reactive lymphoid tissues showed scattered CT45-positive lymphocytes in a single case of florid follicular hyperplasia, raising the possibility that this case was an evolving malignancy. Despite frequent CT45 expression, only 1 of 67 Hodgkin lymphoma patients had detectable anti-CT45 antibodies in the serum, suggesting that the immune response to CT45 may be suppressed. In conclusion, classical Hodgkin lymphoma has the highest frequency of CT45 expression among all malignancies tested to date, the frequency of CT45 expression in DLBCL is similar to that seen in epithelial cancers, and low-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas do not express CT45.","['Chen, Yao-Tseng', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Lee, Peishan', 'Hsu, Melinda', 'Ritter, Erika', 'Chiu, April', 'Gnjatic, Sacha', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Knowles, Daniel M', 'Old, Lloyd J']","['Chen YT', 'Chadburn A', 'Lee P', 'Hsu M', 'Ritter E', 'Chiu A', 'Gnjatic S', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Knowles DM', 'Old LJ']","['Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CT45A1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/metabolism']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/05/11 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['0915050107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0915050107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Feb 16;107(7):3093-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0915050107.

We have found that it is also frequently amplified and the miRNAs are aberrantly overexpressed in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute leukemias. Furthermore, we show that MLL fusions exhibit a much stronger direct binding to the locus of this miRNA cluster than does wild-type MLL; these changes are associated with elevated levels of histone H3 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation and an up-regulation of these miRNAs. We further observe that forced expression of this miRNA cluster increases proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of human cells. More importantly, we show that this miRNA cluster can significantly increase colony-forming capacity of normal mouse bone marrow progenitor cells alone and, particularly, in cooperation with MLL fusions. Finally, through combinatorial analysis of miRNA and mRNA arrays of mouse bone marrow progenitor cells transfected with this miRNA cluster and/or MLL fusion gene, we identified 363 potential miR-17-92 target genes that exhibited a significant inverse correlation of expression with the miRNAs. Remarkably, these potential target genes are significantly enriched (P < 0.01; >2-fold) in cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Taken together, our studies suggest that overexpression of miR-17-92 cluster in MLL-rearranged leukemias is likely attributed to both DNA copy number amplification and direct up-regulation by MLL fusions, and that the miRNAs in this cluster may play an essential role in the development of MLL-associated leukemias through inhibiting cell differentiation and apoptosis, while promoting cell proliferation, by regulating relevant target genes.","['Mi, Shuangli', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Chen, Ping', 'He, Chunjiang', 'Cao, Donglin', 'Elkahloun, Abdel', 'Lu, Jun', 'Pelloso, Luis A', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Huang, Hao', 'Luo, Roger T', 'Sun, Miao', 'He, Miao', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Thirman, Michael J', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Liu, Paul P', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Mi S', 'Li Z', 'Chen P', 'He C', 'Cao D', 'Elkahloun A', 'Lu J', 'Pelloso LA', 'Wunderlich M', 'Huang H', 'Luo RT', 'Sun M', 'He M', 'Neilly MB', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Thirman MJ', 'Mulloy JC', 'Liu PP', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J']","['Department of Medicine and Committee on Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multigene Family']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['0914900107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0914900107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Feb 23;107(8):3710-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0914900107.

METHODS: Adult patients who initiated induction or reinduction chemotherapy for the treatment of AML between December 1, 2006, and March 31, 2008, at a tertiary care hospital were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups: preprotocol (treated before June 1, 2007) and postprotocol (treated on or after June 1, 2007). Medical charts, including pharmacy and laboratory data, were reviewed for all patients. Outcomes measured included antifungal and antibacterial drug costs and utilization and total pharmacy costs. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients were evaluated (33 in each group). Baseline characteristics, except patient age, were similar between groups. Each group incurred similar costs and utilized resources for similar periods of time as evidenced by similar lengths of stay, duration of neutropenia, and mortality. Antibacterial costs, total pharmacy costs, and other utilization outcomes were also similar between the two groups. Alterations to antifungal management strategy occurred more often in the postprotocol group (33% versus 58%, p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Implementation of a posaconazole protocol did not significantly alter antifungal or antibacterial drug costs or utilization or total pharmacy costs. Prophylactic posaconazole was frequently changed to alternative antifungal therapy due to an adverse drug event, perceived lack of efficacy, avoidance of a drug interaction, or inability to tolerate oral intake.","['Nemerovski, Carrie W', 'Mackler, Emily R', 'DePestel, Daryl D', 'Collins, Curtis D', 'Welch, Kathleen S', 'Stevenson, James G']","['Nemerovski CW', 'Mackler ER', 'DePestel DD', 'Collins CD', 'Welch KS', 'Stevenson JG']","['University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC), Ann Arbor, MI, USA. cnemerovski@wayne.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*economics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics', '*Drug Costs', 'Drug Utilization/economics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/economics/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/chemically induced/economics/*prevention & control', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital/economics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['67/4/295 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp090101 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2010 Feb 15;67(4):295-9. doi: 10.2146/ajhp090101.,10.2146/ajhp090101 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a number of endogenous molecules have been reported to be ligands of TLRs. Some of these molecules are known to be expressed in cancer tissue and activate intracellular signal pathways via TLRs during cancer progression. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the expression dynamics of TLRs in the bone marrow of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) during the course of transformation to overt leukemia (OL) using real-time RT-PCR. MDS bone marrow cells at the time of initial diagnosis tended to express higher levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 than control bone marrow cells. Among these TLRs, TLR9 exhibited a significant decrease of expression at the time of transformation to OL. The expression of TLR9 and TNF-alpha showed significant correlation in bone marrow cells from patients with MDS and OL. Immunohistochemically, TLR2 was mostly localized to neutrophils of the control and MDS bone marrow. TLR4 was observed in a subset of neutrophils and a few mononuclear cells in control and MDS bone marrow. In addition, TLR4 was weakly expressed in nearly half of immature myeloid cells of MDS cases. TLR9 was mainly localized to neutrophils in the control and RA bone marrow and strongly expressed in the immature myeloid cells of RAEB cases, although the blastic cells of OL cases did not express TLR9. Bone marrow cells in MDS exhibit frequent apoptosis, while OL cells are prone to be immortal. Thus, TLR9 might be associated with regulation of apoptotic/proliferative signals via TNF-alpha in the MDS bone marrow.","['Kuninaka, Nobuo', 'Kurata, Morito', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Suzuki, Shiho', 'Umeda, Shigeaki', 'Kirimura, Susumu', 'Arai, Ayako', 'Nakagawa, Yasunori', 'Suzuki, Kenshi', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Kuninaka N', 'Kurata M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Suzuki S', 'Umeda S', 'Kirimura S', 'Arai A', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2009/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(10)00025-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2010 Apr;88(2):293-8. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.01.009.

We have shown that nilotinib induces apoptosis in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells which have the wild-type BCR-ABL fusion gene almost to the same extent as it does in the parental sensitive cells by the increase in caspase-3 enzyme activity and the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.

Numerous retroviruses including AEV, FLV, M-MuLV and HTLV-1 have the ability to infect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in the deregulation of normal hematopoiesis and the development of leukemia/lymphoma. Research over the last few decades has elucidated similarities between retroviral-induced leukemogenesis, initiated by deregulation of innate hematopoietic stem cell traits, and the cancer stem cell hypothesis. Ongoing research in some of these models may provide a better understanding of the processes of normal hematopoiesis and cancer stem cells. Research on retroviral induced leukemias and lymphomas may identify the molecular events which trigger the initial cellular transformation and subsequent maintenance of hematologic malignancies, including the generation of cancer stem cells. This review focuses on the role of retroviral infection in hematopoietic stem cells and the initiation, maintenance and progression of hematological malignancies.","['Banerjee, Prabal', 'Crawford, Lindsey', 'Samuelson, Elizabeth', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Banerjee P', 'Crawford L', 'Samuelson E', 'Feuer G']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Retroviridae/*growth & development', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/*virology']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-8 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Feb 4;7:8. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-8.,10.1186/1742-4690-7-8 [doi],20100204,203,,,['CA124595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2826343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jaks are composed of a FERM domain, an SH2 domain, a pseudokinase domain and a kinase domain, and a complex interplay of the Jak domains is involved in regulation of catalytic activity and association to cytokine receptors. Most activating mutations are found in the pseudokinase domain. Here we present recently discovered mutations in the context of our structural models of the respective domains. We describe two structural hotspots in the pseudokinase domain of Jak2 that seem to be associated either to myeloproliferation or to lymphoblastic leukaemia, pointing at the involvement of distinct signalling complexes in these disease settings. The different domains of Jaks are discussed as potential drug targets. We present currently available inhibitors targeting Jaks and indicate structural differences in the kinase domains of the different Jaks that may be exploited in the development of specific inhibitors. Moreover, we discuss recent chemical genetic approaches which can be applied to Jaks to better understand the role of these kinases in their biological settings and as drug targets.","['Haan, Claude', 'Behrmann, Iris', 'Haan, Serge']","['Haan C', 'Behrmann I', 'Haan S']","['Life Sciences Research Unit, University of Luxembourg, 162A, av. de la Faiencerie, 1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. claude.haan@uni.lu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Drug Discovery', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/*genetics', '*Mutation', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'src Homology Domains/genetics']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM1018 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01018.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Mar;14(3):504-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01018.x.

However, data supporting this notion are surprisingly scarce. Therefore, we assessed expression of ZAP-70 in serial samples taken during the course of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 44 patients with CLL diagnosed according to NCI-WG criteria (34 men, 10 women, median age 62, range, 36-81). A total of 104 samples were examined; all patients had at least two measurements. Median interval between the first and the second sample was 13 months (range, 2-36). ZAP-70 expression was detected by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody clone 1E7.2 and negative isotype control. Twenty percent of positive cells were considered as the threshold of positivity. RESULTS: Significant change in ZAP-70 expression (i.e. from positivity to negativity and vice versa) was detected in 15/44 patients (34%). Interestingly, 7/8 patients whose ZAP-70 expression converted to positivity had unmutated IgVH genes. In addition, the conversion was accompanied by clinical progression or relapse in all but one patient. On the other hand, 5/7 patients with loss of ZAP-70 had stable clinical course. One patient became ZAP-70-negative during treatment with prednisone for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to commonly accepted opinion, significant change in ZAP-70 expression in time was detected in a substantial proportion of our patients with CLL. While the conversion to ZAP-70 negativity was found predominantly in patients with stable disease, change to positivity was typical in patients with unmutated IgVH genes at the time of progression or relapse. Based on our pilot results, repeated assessment of ZAP-70 expression might be especially useful at the time of progression or relapse in patients who were initially ZAP-70-negative.","['Vroblova, Vladimira', 'Vrbacky, Filip', 'Hrudkova, Monika', 'Jankovicova, Karolina', 'Schmitzova, Daniela', 'Maly, Jaroslav', 'Krejsek, Jan', 'Smolej, Lukas']","['Vroblova V', 'Vrbacky F', 'Hrudkova M', 'Jankovicova K', 'Schmitzova D', 'Maly J', 'Krejsek J', 'Smolej L']","['Institute of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, Charles University in Prague, School of Medicine and University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. vroblvla@fnhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*blood']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/02/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1425 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01425.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Jun;84(6):513-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01425.x.

Erythropoietin (EPO) can reverse radiotherapy-induced anaemia by stimulating bone marrow cells to produce erythrocytes. However, there are limited studies that address the mechanisms by which EPO exerts its beneficial effects in radiotherapy-induced anaemia. In the present study, we used a human bone marrow-derived EPO-dependent leukaemia cell line UT-7/EPO that progressed further in erythroid development to evaluate the anti-apoptotic effects of EPO on irradiated human erythroid progenitor. 2. The UT-7/EPO cells exposed to gamma-irradiation were cultured in the presence or absence of EPO at a concentration of 7 U/mL. The cell viability, cell apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax and caspase 3 were examined. 3. The results showed that EPO protected the viability of human UT-7/EPO cells exposed to gamma-irradiation. EPO significantly inhibited gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis in human UT-7/EPO cells: a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells was observed (62, 69 and 62% at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively). Furthermore, EPO significantly increased the expression of Bcl-2 protein and the relative Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and decreased the activation of caspase 3 and formation of the p17 and p12 cleavage in similar conditions. 4. In conclusion, EPO exerts anti-apoptotic effects on irradiated human UT-7/EPO cells through upregulation of Bcl-2 protein and the relative Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and by decreasing the activation of caspase 3. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the beneficial function of EPO in radiotherapy-induced anaemia.","['Liu, Yuan-Yuan', 'She, Zhen-Jue', 'Yao, Ming-Hui']","['Liu YY', 'She ZJ', 'Yao MH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, P.

We conducted a single-cell level comparative analysis of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region (TCR-BV) gene families of a total of 1242 spontaneously induced WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in HLA-A*2402(+) patients with AML or MDS and those in healthy donors (HDs). This is the first report of direct usage analysis of TCR-BV gene families of individual TAA-specific CD8(+) T cells at single-cell level. Usage analysis using single-cell RT-PCR of TCR-BV gene families of individual FACS-sorted WT1 tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells showed for the first time (i) that BVs 5, 6, 20, and 27 were commonly biased in both HDs and patients; (ii) that BV4 was commonly biased in HDs and MDS patients; (iii) that BV19 was commonly biased in the patients; and (iv) that BVs 7 and 28, BVs 9 and 15, and BVs 12 and 29 were specifically biased in HDs, AML, and MDS patients, respectively. However, statistical analysis of similarity among HD, AML, and MDS of individual usage frequencies of 24 kinds of TCR-BV gene families indicated that the usage frequencies of TCR-BV gene families in AML and MDS patients reflect those in HDs.

Unusual plasma membrane expression of Hsp70, observed in some cancer cells, contributes to the cell's recognition and elimination by the immune system. Induction of apoptosis in cancer cells was demonstrated to increase Hsp70 translocation to the surface membrane, enhancing immunogenic effects through the stimulation of dendritic cells. As hyperthermia is proposed as a method of choice for anti-cancer therapy, we examined whether apoptosis induction by heat shock enhances Hsp70 membrane translocation in U-937 leukaemia cells. Cells were exposed to sub-lethal heat shock, and intracellular and membrane-bound Hsp70 expression was evaluated in apoptotic and viable cell sub-populations, employing flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Heat shock induced Hsp70 membrane translocation in the viable cells that were able to enhance Hsp70 production upon heating, but not in the cells undergoing apoptosis that continued to express low basal levels of the intracellular protein. Data suggest that the protein translocation was associated with the increasing Hsp70 content rather than the apoptotic process.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib either 140 mg once daily (n = 40) or 70 mg twice daily (n = 44). The rate of confirmed major hematologic response with once-daily dosing (38%) was similar to that with twice-daily dosing (32%). The rate of major cytogenetic response with once-daily dosing (70%) was higher than that with twice-daily dosing (52%). Compared with the twice-daily schedule, the once-daily schedule had longer progression-free survival (median, 3.0 months versus 4.0 months, respectively) and shorter overall survival (median, 9.1 months versus 6.5 months, respectively). Overall safety profiles were similar between two groups, with nonhematologic adverse events being mostly grade 1 or 2. Pleural effusion was less frequent with once-daily dosing than with twice-daily dosing (all grades, 18% versus 32%).

It is widely believed that BCR-ABL activates Akt signalling that suppresses the forkhead O transcription factors (FOXO), supporting the proliferation or inhibiting the apoptosis of CML cells. Although the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is a breakthrough for CML therapy, imatinib does not deplete the leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) that drive the recurrence of CML. Here, using a syngeneic transplantation system and a CML-like myeloproliferative disease mouse model, we show that Foxo3a has an essential role in the maintenance of CML LICs. We find that cells with nuclear localization of Foxo3a and decreased Akt phosphorylation are enriched in the LIC population. Serial transplantation of LICs generated from Foxo3a(+/+) and Foxo3a(-/-) mice shows that the ability of LICs to cause disease is significantly decreased by Foxo3a deficiency. Furthermore, we find that TGF-beta is a critical regulator of Akt activation in LICs and controls Foxo3a localization. A combination of TGF-beta inhibition, Foxo3a deficiency and imatinib treatment led to efficient depletion of CML in vivo. Furthermore, the treatment of human CML LICs with a TGF-beta inhibitor impaired their colony-forming ability in vitro. Our results demonstrate a critical role for the TGF-beta-FOXO pathway in the maintenance of LICs, and strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms that specifically maintain CML LICs in vivo.","['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Hoshii, Takayuki', 'Muraguchi, Teruyuki', 'Tadokoro, Yuko', 'Ooshio, Takako', 'Kondo, Yukio', 'Nakao, Shinji', 'Motoyama, Noboru', 'Hirao, Atsushi']","['Naka K', 'Hoshii T', 'Muraguchi T', 'Tadokoro Y', 'Ooshio T', 'Kondo Y', 'Nakao S', 'Motoyama N', 'Hirao A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Center for Cancer and Stem Cell Research, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-0934, Japan. kazunaka@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (FoxO3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2009/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08734 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08734 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Feb 4;463(7281):676-80. doi: 10.1038/nature08734.,10.1038/nature08734 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a subset of MDS patients with deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)), lenalidomide exerts hematological and cytogenetic effects, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we have investigated the in vitro effects of lenalidomide on an MDS-derived cell line, MDS-L, which carries del(5q) and complex chromosome abnormalities. We found that the growth of MDS-L cells was specifically suppressed mainly by apoptosis, and in addition, multinucleated cells were frequently formed and finally died out in the presence of lenalidomide. Time-lapse microscopic observation and the DNA ploidy analysis revealed that lenalidomide does not affect DNA synthesis but inhibits cytokinesis of MDS-L cells. The gene expression profile showed decreased expression of M phase-related genes such as non-muscle myosin heavy-chain 10, polo-like kinase 1, aurora kinase B, citron kinase and kinesin family member 20A(KIF20A). Interestingly, KIF20A is located at 5q31.

Interferon beta (IFN beta) has shown promise in the treatment of both solid and hematologic malignancies, although the short half-life and toxicity associated with high doses have limited its clinical utility. To overcome these limitations, we investigated the effect of continuous, gene transfer-mediated delivery of IFN beta using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression, on ALL cells with the t(4;11) translocation. We found that this method of IFN beta delivery resulted in complete remission of leukemia in a murine model. However, leukemic cells eventually became resistant to IFN beta and relapse was observed. Activation of NF-kappaB was identified as a mechanism for IFN beta resistance, and inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in resistant cells sensitized cells to IFN beta. IFN beta combined with agents that inhibit NF-kappaB could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of children with mixed lineage leukemia subtype ALL.","['Tracey, L', 'Streck, C J', 'Du, Z', 'Williams, R F', 'Pfeffer, L M', 'Nathwani, A C', 'Davidoff, A M']","['Tracey L', 'Streck CJ', 'Du Z', 'Williams RF', 'Pfeffer LM', 'Nathwani AC', 'Davidoff AM']","[""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20102 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):806-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.2.

In this study, we assess the impact of intensity and duration of Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition on primary CD34(+) progenitors of chronic phase CML patients. As CML cells exposed to dasatinib in vivo are in a cytokine-rich environment, we also assessed the effect of cytokines (six growth factors cocktail or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF) or granulocyte-CSF) in combination with dasatinib. In the presence of cytokines, short-term intense Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition (>or=90% p-Crkl inhibition) with 100 nM dasatinib did not reduce CD34(+) colony-forming cells (CFCs). In contrast, without cytokines, short-term exposure to dasatinib reduced CML-CD34(+) CFCs by 70-80%. When cytokines were added immediately after short-term exposure to dasatinib, CML-CD34(+) cells remained viable, suggesting that oncogene dependence of these cells can be overcome by concomitant or subsequent exposure to cytokines. Additional inhibition of Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak) activity re-established the sensitivity of CML progenitors to intense Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition despite the presence of cytokines. These findings support the contention that therapeutic strategies combining intense Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition and blockade of cytokine signaling pathways can be effective for eradication of CML progenitors.","['Hiwase, D K', 'White, D L', 'Powell, J A', 'Saunders, V A', 'Zrim, S A', 'Frede, A K', 'Guthridge, M A', 'Lopez, A F', ""D'Andrea, R J"", 'To, L B', 'Melo, J V', 'Kumar, S', 'Hughes, T P']","['Hiwase DK', 'White DL', 'Powell JA', 'Saunders VA', 'Zrim SA', 'Frede AK', 'Guthridge MA', 'Lopez AF', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'To LB', 'Melo JV', 'Kumar S', 'Hughes TP']","['Division of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009299 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.299 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):771-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.299.

Although most polycythemia vera patients carry the JAK2V617F mutation, half of those with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis do not, suggesting alternative mechanisms for constitutive JAK-STAT signaling in MPNs. Most patients with primary myelofibrosis have elevated levels of JAK-dependent proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-6) consistent with our observation of JAK1 hyperactivation. Accordingly, we evaluated the effectiveness of selective JAK1/2 inhibition in experimental models relevant to MPNs and report on the effects of INCB018424, the first potent, selective, oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor to enter the clinic. INCB018424 inhibited interleukin-6 signaling (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 281nM), and proliferation of JAK2V617F(+) Ba/F3 cells (IC(50) = 127nM). In primary cultures, INCB018424 preferentially suppressed erythroid progenitor colony formation from JAK2V617F(+) polycythemia vera patients (IC(50) = 67nM) versus healthy donors (IC(50) > 400nM). In a mouse model of JAK2V617F(+) MPN, oral INCB018424 markedly reduced splenomegaly and circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, and preferentially eliminated neoplastic cells, resulting in significantly prolonged survival without myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive effects.

Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the oncogenic potential of every HOXA gene in primary hematopoietic cells. With exception of HOXA2 and HOXA5, all HOXA genes caused a block or delay of hematopoietic differentiation and cooperated with Meis1. No evidence for the alleged tumor-suppressor function of HOXA5 could be found. Whereas all active HOXA genes immortalized mixed granulocytic/monocytic populations, HOXA13 preferentially specified monocytoid development. The anterior HOXA genes HOXA1, HOXA4, and HOXA6 transformed cells, generating permanent cell lines, although they did so less potently than HOXA9. Upon transplantation these lines induced myeloproliferation and acute myeloid leukemia in recipient animals. Kinetic studies with inducible HOX derivatives demonstrated that anterior HOXA genes autonomously contributed to cellular transformation. This function was not mediated by endogenous Hoxa9, which was persistently expressed in cells transformed by anterior HOX genes.

During interphase PML-NBs adopt a spherical organization characterized by the assembly of PML and Sp100 proteins into patches within a 50- to 100-nm-thick shell. This spherical shell of PML and Sp100 imposes little constraint to the exchange of components between the PML-NB interior and the nucleoplasm. Post-translational SUMO modifications, telomere repeats and heterochromatin protein 1 were found to localize in characteristic patterns with respect to PML and Sp100. From our findings, we derived a model that explains how the three-dimensional organization of PML-NBs serves to concentrate different biological activities while allowing for an efficient exchange of components.","['Lang, Marion', 'Jegou, Thibaud', 'Chung, Inn', 'Richter, Karsten', 'Munch, Sandra', 'Udvarhelyi, Aniko', 'Cremer, Christoph', 'Hemmerich, Peter', 'Engelhardt, Johann', 'Hell, Stefan W', 'Rippe, Karsten']","['Lang M', 'Jegou T', 'Chung I', 'Richter K', 'Munch S', 'Udvarhelyi A', 'Cremer C', 'Hemmerich P', 'Engelhardt J', 'Hell SW', 'Rippe K']","['Division of High Resolution Optical Microscopy, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO3 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Autoantigens/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['123/3/392 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.053496 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2010 Feb 1;123(Pt 3):392-400. doi: 10.1242/jcs.053496.,10.1242/jcs.053496 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have recently demonstrated the existence of naturally occurring protein-encoding transcripts of negative polarity in complex retroviruses. We report here on the identification of transcripts of negative polarity in simple murine leukemia virus (MLV). In T-cell and B-cell lymphomas induced by SL3-3 and Akv MLV, antisense transcripts initiated in the U3 region of the proviral 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) and continued into the cellular proto-oncogenes Jdp2 and Bach2 to create chimeric transcripts consisting of viral and host sequence. The phenomenon was validated in vivo using a knock-in mouse model homozygous for a single LTR at a position known to activate Nras in B-cell lymphomas. A 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis indicated a broad spectrum of initiation sites within the U3 region of the 5' LTR. Our data show for the first time transcriptional activity of negative polarity initiating in the U3 region of simple retroviruses and suggest a novel mechanism of insertional activation of host genes. Elucidation of the nature and potential regulatory role of 5' LTR antisense transcription will be relevant to the design of therapeutic vectors and may contribute to the increasing recognition of pervasive eukaryotic transcription.","['Rasmussen, Mads Heilskov', 'Ballarin-Gonzalez, Borja', 'Liu, Jinghua', 'Lassen, Louise Berkhoudt', 'Fuchtbauer, Annette', 'Fuchtbauer, Ernst-Martin', 'Nielsen, Anders Lade', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Rasmussen MH', 'Ballarin-Gonzalez B', 'Liu J', 'Lassen LB', 'Fuchtbauer A', 'Fuchtbauer EM', 'Nielsen AL', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, C.F.

A multicenter study by the GFM (Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies).,864-70,"BACKGROUND: Iron chelation therapy (CT) improves survival in thalassemia major but its beneficial effects on survival in MDS patients remain uncertain. METHODS: We analyzed, by multivariate analysis, survival and causes of deaths in 97 low or intermediate 1 IPSS patients regularly transfused as outpatients, chelated or not, who were included during a month period and followed for 2.5 years. RESULTS: 44 (45%) of patients were not chelated and 53 (55%) received CT, mainly with deferoxamine, for at least 6 months (median duration of chelation 36 months, range 6-131+). During the follow-up period, 66 of the 97 patients died, including 51% and 73% of chelated and non-chelated patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 53 months and 124 months in non-chelated and in chelated patients (p<0.0003). Causes of death did not significantly differ between the two groups (p=0.51). In multivariate Cox analysis, adequate chelation was the strongest independent factor associated with better OS. CONCLUSION: Iron chelation therapy appears to improve survival in heavily transfused lower risk MDS, but prospective randomized studies are required to confirm our findings, and to determine more precisely the mechanisms of this potential survival benefit.","['Rose, Christian', 'Brechignac, Sabine', 'Vassilief, Dominique', 'Pascal, Laurent', 'Stamatoullas, Aspasia', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Larbaa, Dalila', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Chaury, Marie Pierre', 'Roy, Lydie', 'Cheze, Stephane', 'Morel, Pierre', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Rose C', 'Brechignac S', 'Vassilief D', 'Pascal L', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Guerci A', 'Larbaa D', 'Dreyfus F', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Chaury MP', 'Roy L', 'Cheze S', 'Morel P', 'Fenaux P']","[""Service d'Onco-Hematologie, Hopital Saint Vincent de Paul, Universite Catholique de Lille, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chelation Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Deferoxamine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Iron', 'Iron Chelating Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Iron Overload/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transfusion Reaction']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00576-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jul;34(7):864-70. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.12.004.

Implantation is a continuum involving blastocyst adhesion to the endometrial epithelium followed by trophoblast penetration of the epithelium. The trophoblast proliferates and invades through the endometrium, with a subpopulation acting to remodel the spiral arteries. Trophoblast-endometrial interactions in humans involve carefully orchestrated temporal and spatial alterations in factors that are critical for pregnancy success. Emerging evidence suggests important roles for locally produced cytokines including interleukin 11 and leukemia inhibitory factor in the various stages of implantation.

Platelet activation is relevant in a variety of acute thrombotic events and coronary heart diseases. Few studies have examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on platelets, and the mechanisms underlying the signaling pathways remain obscure. The aim of this study was to examine systematically the detailed mechanisms of arsenic trioxide in preventing platelet activation. Arsenic trioxide (5 micromol/L) exhibited more potent activity at inhibiting collagen (1 microg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation than other agonists. Arsenic trioxide (15 and 25 micromol/L) inhibited collagen-induced platelet activation accompanied by [Ca(+2)]i mobilization, thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) formation, phospholipase C (PLC)gamma 2 phosphorylation, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Arsenic trioxide (15 and 25 micromol/L) did not significantly affect cyclic nucleotide-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation. Moreover, arsenic trioxide markedly inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not JNK1/2 or ERK2 phosphorylation in washed platelets. Arsenic trioxide also markedly reduced hydroxyl radical (OH(.)) formation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) study. The most important findings of this study suggest that the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide possibly involves inhibition of the PLC gamma 2-PKC-p38 MAPK cascade, thereby leading to inhibition of [Ca(+2)]i or free radical formation, and finally the inhibition of platelet aggregation.","['Lin, Kuan H', 'Chang, Yi F', 'Fan, Chiao Y', 'Jayakumar, Thanasekaran', 'Lee, Jie J', 'Chou, Duen S', 'Hsiao, George', 'Sheu, Joen-Rong']","['Lin KH', 'Chang YF', 'Fan CY', 'Jayakumar T', 'Lee JJ', 'Chou DS', 'Hsiao G', 'Sheu JR']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Pharmacology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transl Res,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,101280339,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2009/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1931-5244(09)00263-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trsl.2009.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Transl Res. 2010 Feb;155(2):97-108. doi: 10.1016/j.trsl.2009.08.005.

OBJECTIVES: The characteristics of the flanking host chromatin were evaluated at the integration sites in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patients infected with the virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From seven leukemic Colombian patients positive for the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), lymphocyte DNA samples were extracted and amplified by inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR). Clonal expansion and human genome nucleotide composition in an extension of 50 bp was determined. To establish the characteristics of the human genome flanking provirus, 61 IPCR sequences from Colombian and Japanese ATLL patients, were analyzed in silico to obtain insights about the genomic structure, functions and nature of associated chromatin. RESULTS: The clonal expansion of cell clones was predominantly oligoclonal. From 61 IPCR sequences, 155 alignments with homology higher than 95% (e-value < 0.05) were screened. Seventy-five percent of those sequences corresponded to non coding elements that include repetitive and non-repetitive DNA. Fifty percent of the proviral integrations were associated with chromosomes of A and B groups. Viral DNA integration tended to favor exons of genes that replicated early, controlled the cell cycle, or were involved in signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that HTLV-I integration was preferentially directed towards genomic environments with high C:G content, and toward genes that replicate early, regulate cell cycle or involved with signal transduction.","['Salcedo-Cifuentes, Mercedes', 'Cabrera, Jesus', 'Cuesta-Astroz, Yesid', 'Carrasca, Edwin', 'Eizuru, Yoshito', 'Dominguez, Martha C', 'Sanchez, Adalberto', 'Garcia-Vallejo, Felipe']","['Salcedo-Cifuentes M', 'Cabrera J', 'Cuesta-Astroz Y', 'Carrasca E', 'Eizuru Y', 'Dominguez MC', 'Sanchez A', 'Garcia-Vallejo F']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Patogenesis, Departamento de Ciencias Fisiologicas, Facultad de Salud, Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Composition', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/virology', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, cdc', 'Genes, pX', '*Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Virus Integration/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/05 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2010/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['S0120-41572009000200007 [pii]'],ppublish,Biomedica. 2009 Jun;29(2):218-31.,,,,,,,,,Expansion clonica y caracterizacion genomica del proceso de integracion del virus linfotropico humano tipo I en la leucemia/linfoma de celulas T en adultos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: The study population included 83 consecutive patients, referred to our Center with a diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma (50) or solid tumors (33) between 1977 and 1989 and infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) during chemotherapy. RESULTS: At enrollment 77 subjects were HCV-RNA positive. After a median follow-up of 21 years (range 13-36), a sustained virological response (SVR) was obtained in 3 of 29 patients (10%) treated with interferon (IFN), in 1 of 3 patients (33%) treated with IFN and ribavirin, and in 5 of 11 patients (42%) treated with pegylated-IFN and ribavirin (P = 0.03). Forty-two patients remained untreated and only one (2.5%) cleared viremia. Four of 77 patients (5%) developed cirrhosis while other 4 patients died of causes not related to liver. At last follow-up, 72% of HCV-RNA positive patients had abnormal ALT. CONCLUSIONS: In patients cured of pediatric malignancy chronic hepatitis C tends to run an indolent course during childhood and adolescence but more than 70% of treated and more than 80% of untreated cases children maintained HCV viremia. Moreover, after 2-3 decades of observation, 60% of HCV-RNA positive patients had abnormal ALT and 5% had developed cirrhosis. Among treated patients, IFN or pegylated-IFN and ribavirin obtained the higher rate of HCV-RNA clearance.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Bortolotti, Flavia', 'Petris, Maria Grazia', 'Brugiolo, Alessandra', 'Guido, Maria', 'Carli, Modesto']","['Cesaro S', 'Bortolotti F', 'Petris MG', 'Brugiolo A', 'Guido M', 'Carli M']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. simone.cesaro@unipd.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alanine Transaminase/analysis/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fibrosis/drug therapy/virology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Ribavirin/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22438 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):108-12. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22438.,10.1002/pbc.22438 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):7.

There are few studies on the medical management of osteonecrosis in this setting. We studied the therapeutic and radiological effects of oral and intravenous bisphosphonate use compared with standard care as treatment for osteonecrosis in this population. METHOD: Patients who developed osteonecrosis as a complication of ALL therapy between 1994 and 2007 were treated at a single paediatric institution. Of 17 patients, 9 were commenced on bisphosphonates and 8 treated conservatively. Both groups were observed with time. Pain, analgesic requirement and musculoskeletal function were assessed monthly. Affected joints were radiologically imaged at set intervals. Each scan was graded using an ellipsoid method to give the total volume of osteonecrosis, by blinded radiologic examination. RESULTS: Three of six patients treated with oral alendronate showed clinical improvement. The three patients that had no improvement were subsequently treated with intravenous pamidronate. All six patients treated with intravenous pamidronate showed clinical improvement. Seven of eight conservatively treated patients deteriorated clinically. All patients demonstrated reduction in the radiological burden of osteonecrosis with time. There was no difference in the rate of reduction between conservative and bisphosphonate arms. CONCLUSION: Bisphosphonate use, in particular pamidronate, improved pain scores, analgesic requirement and musculoskeletal function in patients with osteonecrosis occurring as a complication of childhood ALL therapy. Objective radiologic benefit of bisphosphonate treatment could not be demonstrated. Risks, benefits and long-term outcome of bisphosphonate use in this population should be addressed in a larger prospective, randomised trial.","['Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Powers, Neil', 'Lee, Senq-J', 'Murray, Kevin J', 'Carter, Tina', 'Cole, Catherine']","['Kotecha RS', 'Powers N', 'Lee SJ', 'Murray KJ', 'Carter T', 'Cole C']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. rishi.kotecha@health.wa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X1J18R4W8P (Alendronate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Alendronate/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Calcium/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diphosphonates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Pain/drug therapy/etiology', 'Pamidronate', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin D/therapeutic use']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22428 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 1;54(7):934-40. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22428.,10.1002/pbc.22428 [doi],,,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (e.g. R-roscovitine) have been shown to induce neutrophil apoptosis and enhance the resolution of inflammation. Interestingly, NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways and key endogenous survival proteins (typified by Mcl-1) are involved in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis and, in cancer-cell lines, have been implicated as possible targets of CDK inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that R-roscovitine over-rides TNF-alpha and LPS-induced survival (determined by morphological examination and binding of fluorescently labelled annexin-V) of isolated peripheral blood neutrophils. This effect did not appear to be mediated via effects on early markers of neutrophil activation (e.g. surface marker expression, shape change, aggregation and superoxide anion generation), by direct inhibition of NF-kappaB activation (assessed by cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha proteolysis and NF-kappaB p65 subunit translocation) and ERK activation (determined by specific ERK phosphorylation) but due to down-regulation (at protein and mRNA level) of the survival protein Mcl-1 but not the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 homologue Bim. These findings suggest that key endogenous survival proteins may be the targets of CDK inhibitors and consequently may be of critical importance in the resolution of inflammation.","['Leitch, Andrew E', 'Riley, Nicola A', 'Sheldrake, Tara A', 'Festa, Michela', 'Fox, Sarah', 'Duffin, Rodger', 'Haslett, Christopher', 'Rossi, Adriano G']","['Leitch AE', 'Riley NA', 'Sheldrake TA', 'Festa M', 'Fox S', 'Duffin R', 'Haslett C', 'Rossi AG']","[""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. aleitch3@staffmail.ed.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Roscovitine', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/05/18 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.200939664 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2010 Apr;40(4):1127-38. doi: 10.1002/eji.200939664.,10.1002/eji.200939664 [doi],,,,,"['G0601481/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT082181/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plant extracts that exhibited IC(50) values less than 30 microg/ml against any tumor cell line were tested on sea urchin egg development and mouse erythrocytes. In addition, all extracts were evaluated for their general toxicity using the brine shrimp lethality assay.

METHODS: The authors describe a 7-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who carried a central venous catheter and developed bacteremia due to Agrobacterium radiobacter (A. radiobacter). RESULTS: Microbiological cure was achieved after administration of systemic ceftriaxone along with gentamicin lock therapy to the central venous catheter for 10 days. Catheter removal was not required, and the patient has not relapsed with bacteremia due to the same pathogen for more than 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A. radiobacter is an emerging pathogen affecting immunocompromised children, particularly those with leukemia who carry central venous catheters. Although it has a low virulence, erratic susceptibility patterns, and high frequency of resistance to many antibiotics, ceftriaxone appears to be successful in treatment of most cases. Catheter removal for the clearance of bloodstream infections due to A. radiobacter may not be required in selected patients like the present case.","['Mantadakis, Elpis', 'Kondi, Anna', 'Christidou, Athanassia', 'Kalmanti, Maria']","['Mantadakis E', 'Kondi A', 'Christidou A', 'Kalmanti M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Democritus University of Thrace and University District Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Thrace, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Catheter-Related Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous', 'Ceftriaxone/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Rhizobium/*isolation & purification']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2008/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12519-010-0018-1 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2010 May;6(2):181-4. doi: 10.1007/s12519-010-0018-1.

Quantitative detection of BCR-ABL fusion gene has become a reliable approach to diagnose and monitor CML. The aim of this study was to evaluate a Roche t (9; 22) kit in CML diagnosis, monitoring treatment responses, and identification of relapse. Using BCR-ABL fusion gene-expressing K562 cells, a series of standard samples were prepared and used to establish a curve for the calculation of BCR-ABL fusion gene expression in patient samples. Our results indicate that PCR detection system with aforementioned kit has good reproducibility. In addition, the relative concentration of BCR-ABL measured by PCR was in agreement with the patient's response to the Imatinib treatment and bone marrow morphology remission. Furthermore, we found that the relative concentration of BCR-ABL fusion gene increased 1-3 months before CML relapse was clinically and cytogenetically diagnosed, suggesting that the PCR-based BCR-ABL fusion gene detection with t (9; 22) kit is able to diagnose the recurrence of CML at least 1 month earlier than the classic cytogenetic analysis. In conclusion, detection of BCR-ABL fusion gene expression in CML using Roche t (9; 22) kit has great clinical value in the primary diagnosis, monitoring treatment responses, and identification of relapse in CML patients.","['Lu, Xiaojun', 'Song, Xingbo', 'Ye, Yuanxin', 'Liu, Xianzhong', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Wang, Jun', 'Ying, Binwu', 'Wang, Lanlan']","['Lu X', 'Song X', 'Ye Y', 'Liu X', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang L', 'Wang J', 'Ying B', 'Wang L']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041 Chengdu, Sichuan Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",2010/02/04 06:00,2011/10/22 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-010-9979-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2011 Jun;38(5):3101-5. doi: 10.1007/s11033-010-9979-3.

Celastrol, derived from the 'Thunder God Vine' and Pro-EGCG, a pre-drug version of green tea polyphenol EGCG have shown potent biological activity in vitro and in vivo. Whether these natural products augment the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of leukemia cells has yet to be demonstrated. Here we demonstrate that these natural products could sensitize the effect of chemotherapy in both K-562 and Jurkat T human leukemia cells. Accordingly, this potent biological activity was associated with increased levels of leukemia cell killing, caspase 3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, the higher levels of apoptotic indices were associated with decreased levels of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in K-562 cells.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that KBH-A42 [N-hydroxy-3-(2-oxo-1-(3-phenylpropyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-3-yl)propanamide ], a synthetic histone deacetylase inhibitor, effectively inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines. In this study, we attempted to determine whether KBH-A42 was also capable of inhibiting the growth of multidrug-resistant cells. Doxorubicin dose-dependently inhibited the growth of P-gp-negative K562 human leukemia cells, but did not show substantial inhibition on the growth of P-gp-positive K562/ADR cells even at 10 microM, the highest concentration of KBH-A42 used, which increased the acetylation of histones in these leukemia cells, dose-dependently and effectively inhibited the cell growth, regardless of the presence of P-gp in the cells. KBH-A42 mediated G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, probably as the result of the down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 and the up-regulation of p21WAF1. When the expression of p21WAF1 was ablated by a specific siRNA, the inhibition of cell growth by KBH-A42 was partly reduced in both cell lines. In addition to the cell cycle arrest, KBH-A42 also induced apoptosis in these cells, which was accompanied by the activation of caspases, including caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, partially blocked the cell death induced by KBH-A42. These results indicate that KBH-A42 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the up-regulation of p21WAF1 and caspase activation, respectively, regardless of the presence of P-gp in the leukemia cells.","['Kang, Moo Rim', 'Lee, Kiho', 'Kang, Jong Soon', 'Lee, Chang Woo', 'Lee, Ki Hoon', 'Kim, Jang Hyun', 'Yang, Jeong Wook', 'Kim, Bo Geun', 'Han, Gyoonhee', 'Kang, Jong Seong', 'Park, Song-Kyu', 'Kim, Hwan Mook']","['Kang MR', 'Lee K', 'Kang JS', 'Lee CW', 'Lee KH', 'Kim JH', 'Yang JW', 'Kim BG', 'Han G', 'Kang JS', 'Park SK', 'Kim HM']","['Bioevaluation Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chungbuk 363-883, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (KBH A42)', '0 (Piperidones)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Piperidones/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2010 Mar;23(3):801-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent study revealed prognostic significance of PBX2 expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma. The significance of PBX2 expression was examined in cases with gastric cancer (GC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and the role of PBX2 in tumor behavior was evaluated in GC and ESCC cell lines of knocked-down PBX2 expression. Expression level of PBX2 was immunohistochemically examined in 94 patients of GC and 64 patients of ESCC. Staining intensity for PBX2 was categorized as equal to or stronger (level 1) and weaker (level 2) than that of endothelial cells. Cases with level 1 expression in more than 20% of tumor were defined as high and others low expression. Patients with low PBX2 expression showed a better prognosis than those with high expression in both GC and ESCC. Multivariate analysis revealed PBX2 expression to be an independent prognosticator for both GC and ESCC. Knocked-down expression of PBX2 in GC and ESCC cell lines resulted in decrease of in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumorigenic activities, but proliferative and invasive activities did not change. Under serum depletion, apoptotic cell proportion was higher in PBX2 knocked-down cells than in control cells. The knock-down of PBX2 reduced Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, the high expression level of PBX2 was an independent negative prognosticator for both GC and ESCC, and PBX2 might promote tumor growth through suppression of apoptosis.","['Qiu, Ying', 'Song, Bogen', 'Zhao, Guifen', 'Deng, Biyong', 'Makino, Tomoki', 'Tomita, Yasuhiko', 'Wang, Junchen', 'Luo, Wenjuan', 'Doki, Yuichiro', 'Aozasa, Katsuyuki', 'Morii, Eiichi']","['Qiu Y', 'Song B', 'Zhao G', 'Deng B', 'Makino T', 'Tomita Y', 'Wang J', 'Luo W', 'Doki Y', 'Aozasa K', 'Morii E']","['Department of Pathology, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, P.R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen Chinese patients with ALL were immunophenotyped by fl ow cytometry and 74 cases were also subjected to karyotype analysis by G-banding technology. RESULTS: Of the 113 Chinese ALL patients, 14.2% were identified as T-ALL and 85.8% as B-ALL. Myeloid antigen (MyAg) expression was documented in 34.9% of the cases analysed and CD13 was most commonly expressed MyAg in ALL patients (23.6%). MyAg positivity was higher in adult with ALL (47.6%) than in children with ALL (26.6%). Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 39 out of 74 (52.7%) cases. The clinical and biological characteristics of ALL patients between MyAg+ and MyAg- groups showed that increased white blood count (WBC) (>50 x 109/L), higher CD34 positivity and higher percentage of adult patients were found to be correlated with MyAg+ ALL. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the immunophenotype did have relevance to the abnormal cytogenetic changes and clinical features in ALL. Flow cytometry immunophenotype has become the most important method for diagnosis and typing of ALL.","['Tong, Haixia', 'Zhang, Jihong', 'Lu, Chunwei', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Zheng, Yingchun']","['Tong H', 'Zhang J', 'Lu C', 'Liu Z', 'Zheng Y']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, China. tonghaixia18@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/05/25 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2010 Jan;39(1):49-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many children still die of their disease or of treatment-related toxicities. Even in patients that are cured, there can be significant and, not uncommonly debilitating, acute and late complications of treatment. Improved understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of leukemia and the increasing availability of high-throughput genomic techniques have facilitated the development of molecularly targeted therapies that have the potential to be more effective and less toxic than the standard approaches. In this article, we review the progress to date with agents that are showing promise in the treatment of childhood acute leukemia, including monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of kinases and other signaling molecules (e.g., BCR-ABL, FLT3, farnesyltransferase, mTOR and gamma-secretase), agents that target epigenetic regulation of gene expression (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors) and proteasome inhibitors. For the specific agents in each of these classes, we summarize the published preclinical data and the clinical trials that have been completed, are in progress or are being planned for children with acute leukemia. Finally, we discuss potential challenges to the success of molecularly targeted therapy, including proper target identification, adequate targeting of leukemia stem cells, developing synergistic and tolerable combinations of agents and designing adequately powered clinical trials to test efficacy in molecularly defined subsets of patients.","['Brown, Patrick', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Carroll, William L', 'Reaman, Gregory H']","['Brown P', 'Hunger SP', 'Smith FO', 'Carroll WL', 'Reaman GH']","['Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer, Center and Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, 1650 Orleans Street, CRB1 Room 2M49, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA, Tel.: +1 410 955 8817, , pbrown2@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,,,2010/02/04 06:00,2010/02/04 06:01,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.09.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2009 Apr 1;2(9):145. doi: 10.1586/ehm.09.1.,,,,,,"['K23 CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA111728-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2794143,,,['NIHMS155094'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Few non-clinical studies have directly compared the mechanisms of action of these agents in a head-to-head fashion, and the agents are often viewed as mechanistically similar DNA hypomethylating agents. To better understand the similarities and differences in mechanisms of these drugs, we compared their in vitro effects on several end points in human AML cell lines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both drugs effected DNA methyltransferase 1 depletion, DNA hypomethylation, and DNA damage induction, with DAC showing equivalent activity at concentrations 2- to 10-fold lower than AZA. At concentrations above 1 microM, AZA had a greater effect than DAC on reducing cell viability. Both drugs increased the sub-G1 fraction and apoptosis markers, with AZA decreasing all cell cycle phases and DAC causing an increase in G2-M. Total protein synthesis was reduced only by AZA, and drug-modulated gene expression profiles were largely non-overlapping. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate shared mechanisms of action of AZA and DAC on DNA-mediated markers of activity, but distinctly different effects in their actions on cell viability, protein synthesis, cell cycle, and gene expression. The differential effects of AZA may be mediated by RNA incorporation, as the distribution of AZA in nucleic acid of KG-1a cells was 65:35, RNA:DNA.","['Hollenbach, Paul W', 'Nguyen, Aaron N', 'Brady, Helen', 'Williams, Michelle', 'Ning, Yuhong', 'Richard, Normand', 'Krushel, Leslie', 'Aukerman, Sharon L', 'Heise, Carla', 'MacBeth, Kyle J']","['Hollenbach PW', 'Nguyen AN', 'Brady H', 'Williams M', 'Ning Y', 'Richard N', 'Krushel L', 'Aukerman SL', 'Heise C', 'MacBeth KJ']","['Celgene Corporation, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DMAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0009001 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Feb 2;5(2):e9001. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0009001.,10.1371/journal.pone.0009001 [doi],20100202,,,,,PMC2814859,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS/FINDINGS: We investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules including fluorescent (Cy3) short interference (si) RNA molecules, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. First, eggs were incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square wave electroporation. Cy3-signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Second, electroporation was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs. Luciferase activity was detected three hours later, whereas luciferase was not evident in eggs soaked in the mRNA. Third, schistosome eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Proviral transgenes were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs, indicating the presence of transgenes in larval schistosomes that had been either soaked or electroporated. However, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis determined that electroporation of virions resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in these schistosomes compared to soaking alone. In addition, relative qPCR indicated a copy number for the proviral luciferase transgene of approximately 20 copies for 100 copies of a representative single copy endogenous gene (encoding cathepsin D). CONCLUSIONS: Square wave electroporation facilitates introduction of transgenes into the schistosome egg. Electroporation was more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped MLV than simply soaking the eggs in virions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.","['Kines, Kristine J', 'Rinaldi, Gabriel', 'Okatcha, Tunika I', 'Morales, Maria E', 'Mann, Victoria H', 'Tort, Jose F', 'Brindley, Paul J']","['Kines KJ', 'Rinaldi G', 'Okatcha TI', 'Morales ME', 'Mann VH', 'Tort JF', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Tropical Medicine, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,"['0 (DNA, Helminth)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'DNA, Helminth/genetics', '*Electroporation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Ovum', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics', 'Transgenes', 'Vesiculovirus/genetics']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pntd.0000593 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010 Feb 2;4(2):e593. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000593.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0000593 [doi],20100202,,,,"['R01 AI072773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI072773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2814865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records from patients treated for neutropenic enterocolitis at Ullevaal University Hospital in the period 2000-2008 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 16 patients with median age 33 years were treated for neutropenic enterocolitis. Induction chemotherapy was given for acute myelogenic (n = 9) or lymphatic (n = 4) leukemia, myelomatosis (n = 2) or lymphoma (n = 1). The patients developed aplasia five days (median) after start of chemotherapy. All patients were first treated conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids and electrolyte supplementation; nine of them recovered without complications. Four underwent surgery for perforation or ileus and these had the longest period with aplasia (median 31 days). Surgery for perforation is mainly limited resection and construction of ileostomy reservoirs (one or two). Three patients died. These were only treated conservatively; aplasia occurred quicker in these patients (after median two days) and they had the largest number of affected bowel segments (median nine). INTERPRETATION: Neutropenic enterocolitis is a heterogeneous condition and the treatment is mainly conservative. Surgical intervention is mandatory in patients with free intraabdominal air, ileus and intractable intestinal bleeding. The prognosis seems to worsen when aplasia develops after a short time and when there is a large number of affected bowel segments.","['Gondal, Ghous', 'Johnson, Egil', 'Paulsen, Vemund', 'Hasan, Banitalebi']","['Gondal G', 'Johnson E', 'Paulsen V', 'Hasan B']","['Gastrokirurgisk avdeling, Oslo universitetssykehus, Ulleval 0407, Oslo, Norway. ghousgondal@hotmail.com']",['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Enterocolitis, Neutropenic/chemically induced/diagnosis/surgery/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1938898 [pii]', '10.4045/tidsskr.08.0089 [doi]']",ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2010 Jan 28;130(2):143-5. doi: 10.4045/tidsskr.08.0089.,10.4045/tidsskr.08.0089 [doi],,,,,,,,Behandling av noytropen enterokolitt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many MDS patients are dependent on red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for symptomatic management of refractory anemia. Iron overload ensues when the iron acquired from transfused RBCs exceeds body storage capacity, thereby raising the risk for end organ damage. This is of greatest concern in patients with lower-risk MDS whose expected survival is measured in years. Transfusion dependence is associated with shorter survival and an increased risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in transfusion-dependent patients. Application of recent advances in the treatment of MDS can reduce or eliminate the need for transfusions, thus minimizing the risk of iron overload. Case control studies, prospective surveys, and phase II studies indicate that iron chelation therapy reduces iron load as measured by changes in serum ferritin and may prolong overall survival. Iron chelation strategies include oral agents such as deferasirox (Exjade, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ), deferiprone (Ferriprox, Apotex Europe BV, Leiden, the Netherlands) and, for those patients who are intolerant of or for whom oral therapy is ineffective, parenteral administration of deferoxamine (Desferal, Novartis).

One month later the cat exhibited Horner's syndrome and was euthanized. At necropsy, multiple neoplastic masses were found in the intestines, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, and lungs. On cytology, many neoplastic lymphocytic cells had fine to large cytoplasmic granules, suggesting large granular lymphocyte (LGL) lymphoma. Histopathological examinations revealed infiltrative proliferation of the neoplastic cells in almost organs. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were intensely positive for CD3 and granzyme B. In the brain, there were multifocal white matter lesions characterized by diffuse myelin loss with mild infiltration of the neoplastic cells.

METHOD: the study was based on the Airtum database, which collects and checks data from all the Airtum registries. The present study was based on 20 general and 2 specific populationbased cancer registries. Overall, we analysed 818,017 incident cases and 342,444 cancer deaths for the time period 1998-2005. Seventy percent of the analysed population was from the North of Italy, 17% from the Centre, and 13% from the South. A joinpoint analysis was carried out to detect the point in time where the trend changed; trends are described by means of the estimated annual percent change (APC), with appropriate 95% confidence intervals. Crude and standardized incidence and mortality rates were computed for 36 cancer sites, for both sexes, three age-classes (0-49, 50-69 and 70+ years), and three geographic areas (North, Centre, and South of Italy). Specific chapters are devoted to long-term trends (1986-2005), differences among age-groups, and international comparisons. RESULTS: In 1998-2005, cancer mortality for all sites showed a statistically significant decrease among men (APC - 1.7) and women (- 0.8). Mortality significantly decreased in both sexes for stomach cancer, rectum cancer, liver cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality also decreased among men for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, prostate, urinary bladder, and leukaemia. Among women mortality decreased for cancers of the colon, bone, breast, and uterus not otherwise specified. An increase in mortality was recorded for lung cancer among women (+1.5) and melanoma among men (+2.6). Incidence for all cancers together (except non-melanoma skin cancers) increased among men (APC +0.3) and remained stable among women. Cancer sites which showed increasing incidence were thyroid and melanoma in both sexes, colon, testis, soft tissue among men, and lung and Hodgkin lymphoma among women. For several cancer sites incidence decreased, e.g., stomach and Kaposi sarcoma (men and women), upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, urinary bladder, myeloma and leukaemia (men), gallbladder, cervix uteri and ovary (women). CONCLUSIONS: this monograph presents a detailed description of cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy. It is based on the Italian Network of Cancer Registries which presently covers about one-third of the whole Italian population. This monograph is a useful scientific tool for all those, be they researchers or public health administrators, who are involved in the fields of cancer prevention and care.",,,,"['eng', 'ita']",['Journal Article'],Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,IM,"['Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries']",2009/07/01 00:00,2009/07/01 00:01,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",['Suppl/2009/EP_V33I4-5S1.pdf [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2009 Jul-Oct;33(4-5 Suppl 1):1-168.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['AIRTUM Working Group'],,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: mortality for the years 1996-2005 among residents in the municipalities where the industrial plants are located (exposed areas) was compared with the mortality among people living in the areas without plants (non-exposed areas). MAIN OUTCOMES: standardized mortality ratios (SMR), using as reference the total population of the Province of Mantua. RESULTS: overall mortality risk was slightly higher in the non-exposed areas and in the district of Viadana than in the Province of Mantua. Mortality risk for all cancers in the exposed areas was lower than in the Province of Mantua (SMR=0.93; 95% IC 0.87-0.99). Mortality for prostate cancer was significantly increased in the exposed areas compared to non-exposed areas (RR=1.83; 95% IC 1.08-3.09) and to the Province of Mantua as a whole (SMR=1.39; 95% IC 1.06-1.79). Mortality maps suggest a higher mortality risk for prostate cancer, mainly among exposed areas. An excess of mortality for leukaemia (non-statistically significant) and for respiratory diseases (statistically significant) was found in Gazzuolo and Sabbioneta, both located in the exposed area. CONCLUSION: no statistically significant excess risk of mortality for cancer of upper aerodigestive tract was found among residents in municipalities where wood dust and formaldehyde producing factories were active. The increased mortality risk for prostate cancer and leukaemia needs to be deeply analyzed.","['Rava, Marta', 'Cazzoletti, Lucia', 'Marcon, Alessandro', 'Padovan, Diego', ""Dal'acqual, Maria"", 'Bacchi, Stefano', 'Silocchi, Caterina', 'Ricci, Paolo', 'de Marco, Roberto']","['Rava M', 'Cazzoletti L', 'Marcon A', 'Padovan D', ""Dal'acqual M"", 'Bacchi S', 'Silocchi C', 'Ricci P', 'de Marco R']","['Istituti Biologici II, Sezione di epidemiologia e statistica medica, Dipartimento di medicina e sanita pubblica, Universita di Verona, Strada Le Grazie 8, Verona. marta.rava@univr.it']",['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Dust)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', 'Causality', 'Chronic Disease/mortality', '*Dust', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Industry', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', '*Mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Respiration Disorders/mortality', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/mortality', 'Wood/*adverse effects']",2010/02/04 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['2009/E&P4-5/E&P4-5_176_art5.pdf [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2009 Jul-Oct;33(4-5):176-83.,,,,,,,,,Confronto dell'esperienza di mortalita per cause specifiche di popolazioni esposte e non esposte a fonti emissive esterne di formaldeide e polveri di legno: lo studio di Viadana.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to elucidate the antigenic basis of the effective graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) responses associated with DLI for the treatment of CLL by analyzing the specificity of plasma antibody responses developing in two DLI-treated patients who achieved long-term remission without graft-versus-host disease. By probing high-density protein microarrays with patient plasma, we discovered 35 predominantly intracellular antigens that elicited high-titer antibody reactivity greater in post-DLI than in pre-DLI plasma. Three antigens-C6orf130, MDS032, and ZFYVE19-were identified by both patients. Along with additional candidate antigens DAPK3, SERBP1, and OGFOD1, these proteins showed higher transcript and protein expression in B cells and CLL cells compared with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DAPK3 and the shared antigens do not represent minor histocompatibility antigens, as their sequences are identical in both donor and tumor. Although ZFYVE19, DAPK3, and OGFOD1 elicited minimal antibody reactivity in 12 normal subjects and 12 chemotherapy-treated CLL patients, 5 of 12 CLL patients with clinical GvL responses were serologically reactive to these antigens. Moreover, antibody reactivity against these antigens was temporally correlated with clinical disease regression.

Our findings suggest that LEF1 inactivation is an important step in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL in a subset of young children.","['Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Ma, Wenxue', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Grebliunaite, Ruta', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Protopopov, Alexei', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Larson, Richard S', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Chin, Lynda', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Jamieson, Catriona', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Gutierrez A', 'Sanda T', 'Ma W', 'Zhang J', 'Grebliunaite R', 'Dahlberg S', 'Neuberg D', 'Protopopov A', 'Winter SS', 'Larson RS', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Silverman LB', 'Chin L', 'Hunger SP', 'Jamieson C', 'Sallan SE', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Codon, Terminator', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Sequence Deletion']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56529-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-234377 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Apr 8;115(14):2845-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-234377.

HTLV-1-infected humanized nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (HU-NOD/SCID) mice were generated by inoculation of NOD/SCID mice with CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells (CD34(+) HP/HSCs) infected ex vivo with HTLV-1. HTLV-1-HU-NOD/SCID mice exclusively developed CD4(+) T-cell lymphomas with characteristics similar to ATLL and elevated proliferation of infected human stem cells (CD34(+)CD38(-)) in the bone marrow were observed in mice developing malignancies. Purified CD34(+) HP/HSCs from HTLV-1-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed proviral integrations suggesting viral infection of human bone marrow-derived stem cells. NOD/SCID mice reconstituted with CD34(+) HP/HSCs transduced with a lentivirus vector expressing the HTLV-1 oncoprotein (Tax1) also developed CD4(+) lymphomas. The recapitulation of a CD4(+) T-cell lymphoma in HU-NOD/SCID mice suggests that HSCs provide a viral reservoir in vivo and act as cellular targets for cell transformation in humans. This animal model of ATLL will provide an important tool for the identification of molecular and cellular events that control the initiation and progression of the lymphoma and potential therapeutic targets to block tumor development.","['Banerjee, Prabal', 'Tripp, Adam', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Crawford, Lindsey', 'Sieburg, Michelle', 'Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Harrington, William Jr', 'Beilke, Mark A', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Banerjee P', 'Tripp A', 'Lairmore MD', 'Crawford L', 'Sieburg M', 'Ramos JC', 'Harrington W Jr', 'Beilke MA', 'Feuer G']","['Department Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation/virology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Species Specificity', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56563-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-246959 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Apr 1;115(13):2640-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-246959.

After remission induction, 2027 patients were randomized to receive MP (n = 1010) or TG (n = 1017) and IT-MTX (n = 1018) or ITT (n = 1009). The results of the thiopurine comparison are as follows. The estimated 7-year event-free survival (EFS) for subjects randomized to TG was 84.1% (+/- 1.8%) and to MP was 79.0% (+/- 2.1%; P = .004 log rank), although overall survival was 91.9% (+/- 1.4%) and 91.2% (+/- 1.5%), respectively (P = .6 log rank). The TG starting dose was reduced from 60 to 50 mg/m(2) per day after recognition of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). A total of 257 patients on TG (25%) developed VOD or disproportionate thrombocytopenia and switched to MP. Once portal hypertension occurred, all subjects on TG were changed to MP. The benefit of randomization to TG over MP, as measured by EFS, was evident primarily in boys who began TG at 60 mg/m(2) (relative hazard rate [RHR] 0.65, P = .002).

Single-nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of sorted leukemic cells further revealed the copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity, namely, acquired uniparental disomy on the short arm of chromosome 6, resulting in the total loss of the mismatched HLA haplotype. These results suggest that the escape from immunosurveillance by the loss of mismatched HLA alleles may be a crucial mechanism of relapse after HLA-haploidentical HSCT.

We addressed the question of whether gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-inducible transcription generates memory that sensitizes cells to a second stimulus. We have found that the major histocompatibility complex class II gene DRA is relocated to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies upon induction with IFN-gamma, and this topology is maintained long after transcription shut off. Concurrent interaction of PML protein with mixed-lineage leukemia generates a prolonged permissive chromatin state on the DRA gene characterized by high promoter histone H3 K4 dimethylation that facilitates rapid expression upon restimulation. We propose that the primary signal-induced transcription generates spatial and epigenetic memory that is maintained through several cell generations and endows the cell with increased responsiveness to future activation signals.","['Gialitakis, Manolis', 'Arampatzi, Panagiota', 'Makatounakis, Takis', 'Papamatheakis, Joseph']","['Gialitakis M', 'Arampatzi P', 'Makatounakis T', 'Papamatheakis J']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Forth, Heraklion 71110, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/29 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00906-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00906-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Apr;30(8):2046-56. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00906-09.

ES cells lacking the function of either PRC1 or PRC2 can differentiate into cells of the three germ layers, whereas simultaneous loss of PRC1 and PRC2 abrogates differentiation. On the molecular level, the differentiation defect is caused by the derepression of a set of genes that is redundantly repressed by PRC1 and PRC2 in ES cells. Furthermore, we find that genomic repeats are Polycomb targets and show that, in the absence of Polycomb complexes, endogenous murine leukemia virus elements can mobilize.

Cell viability was evaluated by the 3-(4-,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that TSL-1 blocked H661 cell cycle progression. Western blot analysis showed decreased expression of cell cycle proteins that promote cell cycle progression, including cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin D1, and increased the expression of proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression, including p27. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that TSL-1 induced H661 cell apoptosis.

Apocrine metaplasia within sclerosing adenosis is known as apocrine adenosis (AA) and is considered a benign lesion of the breast. Apocrine metaplasia and AA have been the subject of many studies; however, little is known about the dynamics of cell turnover in these lesions. Recent studies have shown that some forms of AA may show altered degree of proliferation along with altered expression of bcl-2 and bax proteins. In the current study, we investigate further aspects of apoptosis to help understand the mechanisms of cell turnover in AA and APM. To investigate cell turnover in APM and AA, immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression of the apoptotic markers Bak, Mcl-1, Bcl-x, and Bcl-x(L) in 45 cases of APM (13 cases of nonpapillary APM, 21 cases of simple papillary APM, and 11 cases of complex papillary APM). Also, 34 cases of AA (23 cases of non-atypical AA [NAA] and 11 cases of atypical AA [AAA]) were included in the study. The expression of hTERT and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were also determined. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique was used to study the apoptotic status in 28 cases of APM (12 cases nonpapillary APM and 16 cases of papillary APM including simple and complex forms) and 22 cases of AA (15 cases of NAA and 7 cases of AAA). The results showed that all cases studied by immunohistochemistry were positive for the expression of Bak, Mcl-1, Bcl-x, and Bcl-x(L) showing a pattern of staining similar to that seen in the normal breast epithelium. There was no relation between hTERT positivity and the degree of proliferation in any of the lesions studied. The TUNEL results revealed an apoptotic index (AI) of 0.4% and 0.2% in the papillary and nonpapillary groups of APM, respectively. There was no statistical significance between the AI of these 2 groups and that of the normal breast epithelium (0.3%). The average Ki-67 index in the nonpapillary group was 0.7%, whereas in the papillary group, a value of 4% was recorded. In the cases of AA, an AI of 0.4% and 0.3% in NAA and AAA, respectively, was seen. There was no statistical significance between the AI of these 2 groups and that of the normal breast epithelium (0.3%). The Ki-67 index was 5.2% and 6.6% in the NAA and AAA, respectively. The current results show that apoptosis is not a common event in APM and AA even in the presence of increased proliferation, which may render some of these lesions more susceptible to oncogenic changes. Further studies are needed to study other apoptotic pathways that may be involved in cell turnover in these lesions.","['Elayat, Ghada', 'Selim, Abdel-Ghani A', 'Wells, Clive A']","['Elayat G', 'Selim AG', 'Wells CA']","[""Department of Histopathology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Diagn Pathol,Annals of diagnostic pathology,9800503,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Apocrine Glands/metabolism/*pathology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Breast/metabolism/*pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Epithelium/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibrocystic Breast Disease/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Metaplasia', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Precancerous Conditions/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2009/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1092-9134(09)00055-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2009.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Diagn Pathol. 2010 Feb;14(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2009.05.001.,10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2009.05.001 [doi],,,,,,,['2010 Elsevier Inc.

Sequence features flanking a cleavage site influence the three types of retroviral RNase H activity: internal, DNA 3'-end-directed, and RNA 5'-end-directed. Using the reverse transcriptases of HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), we evaluated how individual base preferences at a cleavage site direct retroviral RNase H specificity. Strong test cleavage sites (designated as between nucleotide positions -1 and +1) for the HIV-1 and M-MuLV enzymes were introduced into model hybrid substrates designed to assay internal or DNA 3'-end-directed cleavage, and base substitutions were tested at specific nucleotide positions. For internal cleavage, positions +1, -2, -4, -5, -10, and -14 for HIV-1 and positions +1, -2, -6, and -7 for M-MuLV significantly affected RNase H cleavage efficiency, while positions -7 and -12 for HIV-1 and positions -4, -9, and -11 for M-MuLV had more modest effects. DNA 3'-end-directed cleavage was influenced substantially by positions +1, -2, -4, and -5 for HIV-1 and positions +1, -2, -6, and -7 for M-MuLV. Cleavage-site distance from the recessed end did not affect sequence preferences for M-MuLV reverse transcriptase. Based on the identified sequence preferences, a cleavage site recognized by both HIV-1 and M-MuLV enzymes was introduced into a sequence that was otherwise resistant to RNase H. The isolated RNase H domain of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase retained sequence preferences at positions +1 and -2 despite prolific cleavage in the absence of the polymerase domain. The sequence preferences of retroviral RNase H likely reflect structural features in the substrate that favor cleavage and represent a novel specificity determinant to consider in drug design.","['Schultz, Sharon J', 'Zhang, Miaohua', 'Champoux, James J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Zhang M', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Box 357242, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Nucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Nucleotides/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(10)00114-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 Mar 19;397(1):161-78. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.059.

(2008) Studia Biologica 2, 21-32]. The physico-chemical, chemical and biological characteristics of toxophallin differ distinctly from those of another death cap toxic protein, namely phallolysin. The interaction of toxophallin with target cells is not mediated by a specific cell surface receptor. It induces chromatin condensation, as well as DNA and nucleus fragmentation, which are typical for apoptosis. However, caspase III inhibitor [benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone] did not stop toxophallin-induced DNA fragmentation. Thus, toxophallin uses a caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis induction. In the present study, we applied a complementary approach based on a combination of proteomics and molecular biology tools for the protein identification of toxophallin. The primary structure of toxophallin was partially studied via direct sequencing of its tryptic peptides, followed by PCR-based cloning of the corresponding cDNA. A subsequent bioinformatic search revealed a structural homology of toxophallin with the l-amino acid oxidase of the Laccaria bicolor mushroom. This demonstrates the usefulness of our approach for the identification of proteins in organisms with unknown genomes. We also found a broad substrate specificity of toxophallin with respect to oxidizing selected amino acids. Ascorbic acid inhibited the cytotoxic effect of toxophallin, most likely as a result of scavenging hydrogen peroxide, which is the product of oxidase catalysis.

Drug accumulation was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from trimethylammonium-diphenyl-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) located at the outer leaflet to a rhodamine analog. Uptake of dye into cells whose mitochondria had been inactivated was displayed as two phases of TMA-DPH fluorescence quenching. The initial phase comprised a rapid drop in fluorescence that was neither affected by cooling the cells on ice, nor by activity of mitochondria or ABC transporters. This phase reflects the association of dye with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The subsequent phase of TMA-DPH fluorescence quenching occurred in drug-sensitive cell lines with a half-life in the range 20-40 s. The second phase of fluorescence quenching was abolished by incubation of the cells on ice and was transiently inhibited in cells with active mitochondria. Thus, the second phase of fluorescence quenching reflects the accumulation of dye in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, presumably as a result of flip-flop of dye across the plasma membrane and slow diffusion from the inner leaflet into the cells. Whereas activity of P-glycoprotein prevented the second phase of fluorescence quenching, the activity of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 had no effect on this phase. Thus, P-glycoprotein appears to pump rhodamines from the cytoplasmic leaflet either to the outer leaflet or to the outer medium.","['Katzir, Hagar', 'Yeheskely-Hayon, Daniella', 'Regev, Ronit', 'Eytan, Gera D']","['Katzir H', 'Yeheskely-Hayon D', 'Regev R', 'Eytan GD']","['Department of Biology, The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester)', '1720-32-7 (Diphenylhexatriene)', '71316-28-4 (1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Diphenylhexatriene/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rhodamines/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/05/08 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7555 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07555.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2010 Mar;277(5):1234-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07555.x.

METHODS: To establish direct relationship between P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1 and MDR1) expression and IB-MECA induced cell death, a straightforward method for precise estimation of intracellular level of this A3AR agonist was developed. RESULTS: We subjected three human leukaemia cell lines HL-60, K562 and K562/HHT to treatment with micromolar concentrations of IB-MECA. Although all cell lines used expressed A3AR, there was a large difference in their sensitivity to IB-MECA. While HL-60 and K562 cells were almost equally sensitive, the K562/HHT cells, which exhibit a multi-drug resistance phenotype because of overexpression of P-gp, were significantly more resistant. We found that the intracellular level of IB-MECA in K562/HHT cells was approx. 10 times lower than those in HL-60 or K562 cells. Inhibitors of P-gp, including cyclosporine A (CsA) and verapamil (Vpa), increased the intracellular level of IB-MECA and reversed the resistance of K562/HHT cells to this drug. Accordingly, shRNA-mediated down-regulation of P-gp significantly increased the intracellular level of IB-MECA in K562/HHT cells which simultaneously exhibited reduced resistance to this A3AR agonist. In addition, an in vitro enzyme-based assay provided evidence that IB-MECA might serve as a substrate for P-gp. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that P-gp overexpression prevents cells from IB-MECA induced apoptosis despite the A3AR expression. Pro-apoptotic effect of IB-MECA seemed to strongly depend on its intracellular accumulation rather than on its interaction with A3AR.","['Mlejnek, P', 'Dolezel, P']","['Mlejnek P', 'Dolezel P']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic. mlejnek_petr@volny.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Physiol (Oxf),"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",101262545,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', ""152918-18-8 (N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)-5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine)"", 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', '*Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['APS2087 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02087.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Physiol (Oxf). 2010 Jun;199(2):171-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02087.x.

The findings are from a 5-year longitudinal study that documented the experience of treatment for childhood leukemia and related disorders from the perspective of the child patient and their family from the point of diagnosis to 1 year post-treatment. To date, scant information on the serious emotional side-effects of corticosteroid administration for children with ALL during the continuation period is available. This is concerning in light of the many serious challenges corticosteroid use poses to families of children with ALL. For this group of parents, dealing with the impact of corticosteroids on their child was reported as the major and only treatment-related stress during the continuation period of treatment for ALL. The impact of these drugs, described in very negative terms, was considered exacerbated by the fact that during the continuation period they are repeatedly administered in 5-week cycles. Anger and aggression, both passive and in acts of physical violence, in combination with temper tantrums and uncontrollable behavior were major concerns. Under the influence of corticosteroids the children could be moody, grumpy, confused, emotionally labile, depressed, sullen and withdrawn. The children could quickly switch from one emotional state to another, such as from aggression to emotionality. They could experience trouble with sleeping and talk excessively. The parents outlined a range of positive strategies for coping with the difficult behavior. The authors make a number of recommendations aimed at assisting parents to deal with the impact of the administration of corticosteroids in continuation therapy, including increasing the awareness on the part of health care providers of the side-effects of these drugs and their impact on the child with ALL and their family; provision of information to families on the effects of corticosteroid use; and, ensuring that professional counseling assistance is available when required.","['McGrath, Pam', 'Rawson-Huff, Nicole']","['McGrath P', 'Rawson-Huff N']","['International Program of Psycho-Social Health Research, Central Queensland University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. pam_mcgrath@bigpond.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Issues Compr Pediatr Nurs,Issues in comprehensive pediatric nursing,7702326,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],,"['Adult', 'Attention/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child Behavior/*drug effects', 'Depression/chemically induced', 'Disease Progression', 'Emotions/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/education/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sleep/drug effects']",2010/02/04 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2010/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01460860903486572 [doi]'],ppublish,Issues Compr Pediatr Nurs. 2010;33(1):5-19. doi: 10.3109/01460860903486572.,10.3109/01460860903486572 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1999, the varicella vaccine is licensed in Poland and recommended for use in adults without history of a varicella infection, and in children and young adults with remission of acute leukemia. While serological data is essential to assess the appropriate vaccination programme, we conducted the first in Poland serosurvey on a representative group of Polish population aged 1-19. Serum samples were selected from a serum bank collected in 1995-2004 with a catchment area of the all geographical regions of Poland. A total of 1300 serum samples collected over 9 years (1995-1996, 1998-2004) were selected using a stratified sampling design (stratification by age). Samples were selected, consisting of 100 samples for each 1-year band of age groups 0-9 years, and 40 samples for each 1-year band of age groups 10-19 years. IgG serum antibodies specific to VZV were detected using an indirect enzyme immunoassay and the antibody level was expressed in international units per millilitre (mIU/ml) and was refered to the international standard for VZV immunoglobulin of 50 IU. The overall seroprevalence estimate, adjusted for sampling design for the age group 1-19 was 76.6% (95% CI: 74.6%-78.7%). Seroprevalence correlated closely with age (p<0.0001) and among 18 and 19 year olds reached 95% and 98% respectively. No association was found between gender, rural/urban areas and geographical regions of Poland. For samples collected over the 5 year period (2000-2004), evidence of overall differences in seropositivity over these years was not observed. In Poland VZV vaccination is provided only for a limited group of high risk patients.

The following points are essential for the diagnosis of ATL: (1) cytologically or histologically proven peripheral T-cell malignancy, and (2) positivity for anti-HTLV-1 antibody. When a patient is diagnosed with ATL, it is important to make an accurate diagnosis of clinical subtype in order to make appropriate treatment decisions. For patients with smoldering or chronic type ATL, close observation with careful monitoring for opportunistic infections is recommended. For patients with the acute or lymphoma type requiring therapy, enrollment in a clinical trial is recommended. When there is no active trial or the patient is ineligible for a trial, we recommend intensive chemotherapy used for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as the LSG15 regimen (VCAP-AMP-VECP) based on a recent phase III study. Because most patients with ATL are not curable with current chemotherapy regimens, it is reasonable to consider the applicability of allogeneic stem cell transplantation inpatients who show responses to chemotherapy.

Imatinib, a potent BCR-ABL inhibitor, is the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic-phase CML because of its high long-term response rates and favorable tolerability profile compared with previous standard therapies. However, resistance to imatinib develops in 2% to 4% of patients annually. For patients with acquired cytogenetic resistance to standard-dose imatinib (400 mg daily), imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is an excellent first option for managing patients and achieving cytogenetic responses. However, for patients with primary resistance to imatinib, hematologic disease recurrence, or emergent BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, imatinib dose escalation may not be sufficient to control the disease. For these patients, the potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib are available. Both agents provide effective therapeutic options for patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance. For the current overview, the authors reviewed the data supporting the use of both dasatinib and nilotinib in imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant patients, and they have highlighted the future of CML therapy. Overall, the article is intended to offer physicians a comprehensive review of the current literature and to provide data supporting various treatment options for patients with CML throughout the course of imatinib therapy and beyond.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes J', 'La Rosee P', 'Hochhaus A']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In this method, a pair of oligos complementary target mRNA was used to probe transcripts for each gene of interest. The ligated products of oligos pair were clonally amplified on beads in millions of parallel compartmentalized droplets in a water-in-oil emulsion. The levels of each transcript within a sample were measured by counting the number of the correspondingly amplified beads which were immobilized on a glass surface. To demonstrate its utility, this method has been applied to the quantitation of the mRNA levels for two transcription factors, Klf4 and Sox5, and a housekeeping gene, Gapdh, in human leukemia K562 cells before and after induction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Interestingly, we found a significant downregulation of the mRNA level of Sox5 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. The mRNA mediate-ligation and BEAMing technique provides an accurate and sensitive way to quantify the amount of multiple specific mRNA in a very small number of cells, which may be valuable in the studies requiring precise and parallel quantization of multiple mRNA in the defined cell populations.","['Shi, Xiaolong', 'Tang, Chao', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zhou, Dequan', 'Lu, Zuhong']","['Shi X', 'Tang C', 'Wang W', 'Zhou D', 'Lu Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,"['0 (Emulsions)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOXD Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Emulsions', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'SOXD Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/elps.200900362 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2010 Jan;31(3):528-34. doi: 10.1002/elps.200900362.,10.1002/elps.200900362 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of proteins by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a common mechanism in leukemia development. Therefore, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been developed for AML therapy and are currently under investigation. The staurosporine derivate PKC412 (Midostaurin) was found to be an effective inhibitor of the FLT3-RTK and is currently undergoing clinical trials for FLT3-mutated AML patients. Since resistance towards TKIs has been observed in vitro and in clinical trials, we have generated a PKC412-resistant clone (MV4-11r) of the human myelomonoblastic cell line MV4-11, which carries a homozygous FLT3-ITD mutation. MV4-11r displayed higher vitality after addition of PKC412 compared with MV4-11 with a pronounced reduction of apoptotic cells. Cytogenetic characterization revealed the acquisition of additional aberrations in the resistant cell line such as clonal alterations at chromosome 13q with additional FLT3 signals. Microarray analysis revealed significant expression changes in several genes prior to and after incubation with PKC412. The expression status of candidate genes being regulated by FLT-ITD like JAG1, p53, MCL-1, C-KIT, and FLT3/-L was confirmed by real-time PCR. In summary, resistance against PKC412 appears to be mediated by up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of proapoptotic signals as well as genes that are involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Steudel, Christine', 'Oelschlagel, Uta', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Koch, Sina', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Thiede, Christian']","['Stolzel F', 'Steudel C', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Mohr B', 'Koch S', 'Ehninger G', 'Thiede C']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus Dresden der TU Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany. friedrich.stoelzel@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0889-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Jul;89(7):653-62. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0889-1.

In adults, the literature supports expectant management of clinically silent gallstones. The evidence for this management approach in children is limited to a number of small series. Our objective was to review the risk factors, complications, and outcomes of gallstones at our institution, particularly in those patients who are asymptomatic at the time of initial diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 382 cases of gallstones in children. These patients were diagnosed with sonography. Data on age at diagnosis, presentation, sonographic findings, risk factors, complications, surgery, and follow-up were collected. A chi2 test was used to compare the complication rates between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the sample. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 50.5% of children were asymptomatic; these patients were diagnosed at a mean age of 8.23 years. Compared with symptomatic patients, they were less likely to have a hemolytic anemia but more likely to have other risk factors, including cardiac surgery, leukemia and lymphoma, short bowel syndrome, or exposure to total parenteral nutrition or cephalosporins. These patients had a lower rate of complications than the symptomatic patients (4.6% vs 28.2% of symptomatic, P < 0.0001) and only 3.1% developed symptoms that necessitated surgery (vs 59.0% of symptomatic). Of the 58 (15.1%) diagnosed in infancy, 47 (81.0%) were asymptomatic. The infant group also had low rates of complications (8.6%) and cholecystectomy (1.7%). In cases with sonographic follow-up, resolution of gallstones was demonstrated in 16.5% of asymptomatic patients and in 34.1% of infants. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that clinically silent gallstones in children and infants are associated with low rates of complications and can be managed conservatively, unless complications occur. Patients with sickle cell disease, spherocytosis, and elliptocytosis had high complication rates and required surgery more often.","['Bogue, Conor O', 'Murphy, Amanda J', 'Gerstle, J Ted', 'Moineddin, Rahim', 'Daneman, Alan']","['Bogue CO', 'Murphy AJ', 'Gerstle JT', 'Moineddin R', 'Daneman A']","['Department of Diagnostic Imaging, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. cbogue@eircom.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,8211545,['0 (Cephalosporins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/complications', 'Cephalosporins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholecystectomy', 'Cholelithiasis/*complications/therapy', 'Female', 'Gallstones/*complications/therapy', 'Heart Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Parenteral Nutrition/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Short Bowel Syndrome/complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181b99c72 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2010 Mar;50(3):303-8. doi: 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181b99c72.,10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181b99c72 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,['J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2011 Apr;52(4):499.

The clinical and pathologic spectrum of this rare entity, including comparison to other high-grade B-cell neoplasms, has not been well defined. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical and pathologic features of 20 cases of DHL seen at our institution during a 5-year period. In addition, we carried out case-control comparisons of DHL with BL and International Prognostic Index (IPI)-matched DLBCL. The 11 men and 9 women had a median age of 63.5 years (range 32 to 91). Six patients had a history of grade 1 to 2 follicular lymphoma; review of the prior biopsy specimens in 2 of 5 cases revealed blastoid morphology. Eighteen patients had Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4 disease and all had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at presentation. Extranodal disease was present in 17/20 (85%), bone marrow involvement in 10/17 (59%) and central nervous system (CNS) disease in 5/11 (45%). Nineteen patients were treated with combination chemotherapy, of whom 18 received rituximab and 14 received CNS-directed therapy. Fourteen patients (70%) died within 8 months of diagnosis. Median overall survival in the DHL group (4.5 mo) was inferior to both BL (P=0.002) and IPI-matched DLBCL (P=0.04) control patients. Twelve DHL cases (60%) were classified as B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, 7 cases (35%) as DLBCL, not otherwise specified, and 1 case as B-LBL. Distinguishing features from BL included expression of Bcl2 (P<0.0001), Mum1/IRF4 (P=0.006), Ki-67 <95% (P<0.0001), and absence of EBV-EBER (P=0.006). DHL commonly contained the t(8;22) rather than the t(8;14) seen in most BL controls (P=0.001), and exhibited a higher number of chromosomal aberrations (P=0.0009). DHL is a high-grade B-cell neoplasm with a poor prognosis, resistance to multiagent chemotherapy, and clinical and pathologic features distinct from other high-grade B-cell neoplasms. Familiarity with the morphologic and immunophenotypic spectrum of DHL is important in directing testing to detect concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements when a karyotype is unavailable. The aggressive clinical behavior and combination of genetic abnormalities seen in these cases may warrant categorization as a separate entity in future classifications and call for novel therapeutic approaches.","['Snuderl, Matija', 'Kolman, Olga K', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Hsu, Jessie J', 'Ackerman, Adam M', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Ferry, Judith A', 'Harris, Nancy Lee', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Zukerberg, Lawrence R', 'Abramson, Jeremy S', 'Hochberg, Ephraim P', 'Lee, Hang', 'Lee, Alfred I', 'Toomey, Christiana E', 'Sohani, Aliyah R']","['Snuderl M', 'Kolman OK', 'Chen YB', 'Hsu JJ', 'Ackerman AM', 'Dal Cin P', 'Ferry JA', 'Harris NL', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Zukerberg LR', 'Abramson JS', 'Hochberg EP', 'Lee H', 'Lee AI', 'Toomey CE', 'Sohani AR']","['Department of Pathology, James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181cd3aeb [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2010 Mar;34(3):327-40. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181cd3aeb.,10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181cd3aeb [doi],,,,,"['R35 CA197449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA076404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM074897/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM074897-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3152212,,,['NIHMS305320'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the role of miR-34a methylation in a panel of hematological malignancies including acute leukemia [acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)], chronic leukemia [chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)], multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The methylation status of miR-34a promoter was studied in 12 cell lines and 188 diagnostic samples by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. miR-34a promoter was unmethylated in normal controls but methylated in 75% lymphoma and 37% myeloma cell lines. Hypomethylating treatment led to re-expression of pri-miR-34a transcript in lymphoma cells with homozygous miR-34a methylation. In primary samples at diagnosis, miR-34a methylation was detected in 4% CLL, 5.5% MM samples and 18.8% of NHL at diagnosis but none of ALL, AML and CML (P = 0.011). In MM patients with paired samples, miR-34a methylation status remained unchanged at progression. Amongst lymphoid malignancies, miR-34a was preferentially methylated in NHL (P = 0.018), in particular natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. In conclusion, amongst hematological malignancies, miR-34a methylation is preferentially hypermethylated in NHL, in particular NK/T-cell lymphoma, in a tumor-specific manner, therefore the role of miR-34a in lymphomagenesis warrants further study.","['Chim, C S', 'Wong, K Y', 'Qi, Y', 'Loong, F', 'Lam, W L', 'Wong, L G', 'Jin, D Y', 'Costello, J F', 'Liang, R']","['Chim CS', 'Wong KY', 'Qi Y', 'Loong F', 'Lam WL', 'Wong LG', 'Jin DY', 'Costello JF', 'Liang R']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, 102 Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China. jcschim@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq033 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq033 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Apr;31(4):745-50. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq033.

Thus, we assessed the frequency and impact of hypopigmentation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) taking IM in our institution in Riyadh. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 24 adult CML patients taking IM and followed from March to June 2008. Telephonic interviews with all the CML patients taking IM were conducted and case notes were reviewed. Findings were confirmed on a subsequent clinic visit by a physician. Demographic features, disease status, response to IM, presence and severity of skin changes and impact of these changes on the patients and the disease were noted. RESULTS: Eight (33%) patients (6 males, 2 females) developed hypopigmentation due to IM. All patients had newly diagnosed, chronic phase CML and received 400 mg IM daily. The median age of the affected group was 37 years (range 18-54 years). Hypopigmentation developed during the first 3 months of treatment in 5 patients and 6 months or later in 3 patients. It was generalized in 7 patients and involved the hands and face in one patient. No photosensitivity was reported and none had other significant side effects. CONCLUSION: Hypopigmentation of the skin can develop in about one third of CML patients taking IM.

We report predictive and prognostic factors in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a tertiary care center in a developing country. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of adult patients with acute leukemia who were referred to the American University of Beirut Medical Center between 1996 and early 2006. RESULTS: Of 105 patients, 36 (34%) patients were diagnosed with ALL, and included 19 (53%) males and 17 (47%) females with a median age of 34 years (range, 14-79 years). Induction chemotherapy with curative intent was administered to 34 (94%) patients. Twenty-seven patients received intrathecal chemotherapy as prophylaxis (n=24) or as treatment for CNS disease (n=3). Twenty-eight patients (82%) achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) time was 22 months and the five-year OS for ALL patients was 38%. The median disease-free survival (DFS) time was 12 months, while the five-year DFS was 38%. Multivariate analysis showed that age <40 years, WBC <30 X 109/L, achievement of CR after first induction, and CNS prophylaxis were predictive factors for OS and DFS. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations and the relatively low socioeconomic status of the Lebanese population, OS (38%) and DFS (38%) are quite similar to international data. Trends toward a higher CR and DFS in adults are due to intensified consolidation chemotherapy, the use of stem cell transplantation, and improvements in supportive care.","['Charafeddine, Khalil M', 'Hatoum, Hassan A', 'Otrock, Zaher K', 'Mahfouz, Rami A', 'Salem, Ziad M', 'Shamseddine, Ali I', 'Taher, Ali T', 'El-Saghir, Nagi S', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Charafeddine KM', 'Hatoum HA', 'Otrock ZK', 'Mahfouz RA', 'Salem ZM', 'Shamseddine AI', 'Taher AT', 'El-Saghir NS', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Pathology, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lebanon', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['09-333 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50021-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2009;2(2):333-9. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50021-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stem cell transplantation was introduced into South Africa in 1970 as a structured experimental and clinical program. In this report, we summarize the demography and outcome by disease category, gender, and type of procedure in patients older than 18 years of age who were seen from April 1995 to December 2002. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 247 individuals over 18 years of age for whom complete data were available. These patients received grafts mostly from peripheral blood with the appropriate stem cell population recovered by apheresis. RESULTS: Patient ages ranged from 20 to 65 years with a median age of 42 years. There were 101 females and 146 males. There were no withdrawals and 63% survived to the end of the study. At 96 months of follow-up, a stable plateau was reached for each disease category. Median survival was 3.3 years (n=6, 14.6%) for acute lymphoblastic anemia, 3.1 years (n=44, 18%) for acute myeloid leukemia, 2.8 years (n=47, 19%) for chronic granulocytic leukemia, 2.8 years (n=71, 29%) for lymphoma, 1.5 years (n=23, 9%) for myeloma, 1.43 years (n=10, 4%) for aplasia, and 1.4 years (n=38, 15%) for a miscellaneous group comprising less than 10 examples each. Multivariate analysis showed that only diagnosis and age had a significant impact on survival, but these two variables might be interrelated. There was no significant difference in outcome by source of graft. CONCLUSION: The results confirm that procedures carried out in a properly constituted and dedicated unit, which meets established criteria and strictly observes treatment protocols, generate results comparable to those in a First World referral center. Low rates of transplant-related mortality, rejection and graft-versus-host disease are confirmed, but the benefits cannot be extrapolated outside of academically oriented and supervised facilities.","['Wood, Lucille', 'Haveman, Jonathan', 'Juritz, June', 'Waldman, Herman', 'Hale, Geoffrey', 'Jacobs, Peter']","['Wood L', 'Haveman J', 'Juritz J', 'Waldman H', 'Hale G', 'Jacobs P']","['Division of Clinical Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University- Tygerberg Academic Hospital, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*standards', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'South Africa', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['09-320 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50020-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2009;2(2):320-32. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50020-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The BCR-ABL fusion gene was detected by FISH in 24 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib. The sensitivity and specificity of D-FISH were compared with those of single-fusion FISH (S-FISH) and RT-PCR. RESULTS: D-FISH was more sensitive and specific than S-FISH. In normal control subjects, the cutoff rates of D-FISH and S-FISH were 0.73% and 6.24%, respectively, showing a significant difference between them. In 24 CML cases receiving imatinib treatment, the positivity rates of S-FISH and D-FISH were 7/24 (29.2%) and 13/24 (54.2%), respectively. The results of D-FISH had a high correlation to that of RT-PCR.

Long-term data on outcome and late effects of PBPCT compared with BMT are scarce. Here we present long-term data from a randomised study comparing PBPCT with BMT. METHODS: Between February, 1995, and September, 1999, 329 patients with leukaemia received either PBPCT (n=163) or BMT (n=166) from HLA-identical sibling donors after central randomisation accounting for stratification criteria. Follow-up data were collected via questionnaires from 87% (176 of 202; 84 PBPCT, 92 BMT) patients who survived for more than 3 years (median of 9.3 years) after transplantation. Efficacy analyses included all patients who received treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01020175. FINDINGS: 10-year overall survival was 49.1% for patients who underwent PBPCT and 56.5% for patients who underwent BMT (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60-1.15; p=0.27). Leukaemia-free survival was 28.3% with BMT versus 13.0% with PBPCT (0.61, CI 0.32-1.16; p=0.12) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; 62.3% with BMT versus 47.1% with PBPCT for acute myeloid leukaemia (0.67, 0.39-1.16; p=0.16); and 40.2% with BMT versus 48.5% with PBPCT for chronic myeloid leukaemia (1.12, 0.73-1.74; p=0.60). More patients developed chronic graft-versus-host disease after PBPCT (n=56, 73%) than after BMT (n=46, 56%; p=0.021), with more frequent involvement of skin, liver, and oral mucosa, and more patients who underwent PBPCT needed immunosuppressive treatment 5 years after transplantation (n=20, 26%) than patients who had BMT (n=10, 12%; p=0.024). Nonetheless, there was no difference in performance status, return to work, incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans, and haematopoietic function between the two groups. 14 cases of secondary malignancies occurred (five after BMT, nine after PBPCT), resulting in a cumulative incidence of 3% and 7% after BMT and PBPCT (p=0.17), respectively. INTERPRETATION: More than 9 years after transplantation, overall and leukaemia-free survival remain similar in patients who underwent BMT and PBPCT. Differences in the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease and the duration of immunosuppression exist, but do not affect survival, general health status, or late events.

GVHD fundamentally depends upon the activation of donor T cells by host antigen-presenting cells (APCs), but the precise location of these interactions remains uncertain. We examined the role of secondary lymphoid organs (SLO) in the induction of GVHD by using homozygous aly/aly mice that are deficient in lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer's patches (PPs). Lethally irradiated, splenectomized, aly/aly (LN/PP/Sp-/-) mice and sham-splenectomized, aly/+ (LN/PP/Sp+/+) mice received BMT from either syngeneic (aly/aly) or allogeneic, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) disparate donors. Surprisingly, although LN/PP/Sp-/- allo-BMT recipients experience a survival advantage, they developed significant systemic and target organ GVHD that is comparable to LN/PP/Sp+/+ controls. Early after allo-BMT, the activation and proliferation of donor T cells was significantly greater in the BM cavity of LN/PP/Sp-/- mice compared to LN/PP/Sp+/+ controls. Donor T cells in LN/PP/Sp-/- mice demonstrated cytolytic activity in vitro, but Graft vs Leukemia (GVL) activity could be overcome by increasing the tumor burden. These data suggest that SLO contribute to, but are not required for, allogeneic T cell responses, and suggest that the BM may represent an alternative, albeit less efficient site for T cell activation following allo-BMT.","['Silva, Ines A', 'Olkiewicz, Krystyna', 'Askew, David', 'Fisher, Jacquelyn M', 'Chaudhary, Meghana N', 'Vannella, Kevin M', 'Deurloo, Daphne T', 'Choi, Sung W', 'Pierce, Elizabeth M', 'Clouthier, Shawn G', 'Liu, Chen', 'Cooke, Kenneth R']","['Silva IA', 'Olkiewicz K', 'Askew D', 'Fisher JM', 'Chaudhary MN', 'Vannella KM', 'Deurloo DT', 'Choi SW', 'Pierce EM', 'Clouthier SG', 'Liu C', 'Cooke KR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00603-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 May;16(5):598-611. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.12.007.

While many researchers have attempted to re-engineer viruses to be suited for gene delivery, others have sought to develop non-viral alternatives. We have developed a complementary approach in which viral and synthetic components are combined to form hybrid nanoparticulate vectors. In particular, we complexed non-infectious retrovirus-like particles lacking a viral envelope protein, from Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-VLP) or human immunodeficiency virus (H-VLP), with poly-L-lysine (PLL) or polyethylenimine (PEI) over a range of polymer/VLP ratios. At appropriate stoichiometry (75-250 microg polymer/10(6) VLP), the polymers replace the function of the viral envelope protein and interact with the target cell membrane, initiate cellular uptake and facilitate escape from endocytic vesicles. The viral particle, once in the cytosol, efficiently completes its normal infection process including integration of viral genes with the host genome as demonstrated by long-term (at least 5 weeks) transgene expression. In addition, hybrid vectors comprising H-VLP were shown to be capable of infecting non-dividing cells.","['Ramsey, Joshua D', 'Vu, Halong N', 'Pack, Daniel W']","['Ramsey JD', 'Vu HN', 'Pack DW']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Polymers)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Chimera', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Polyethyleneimine', 'Polymers', 'Transgenes', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virion/genetics', 'Virus Diseases/genetics', 'Viruses/genetics']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(10)00083-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.01.031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2010 May 21;144(1):39-45. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.01.031.

AID is expressed as a native transcript and as several splice variants, with as yet undefined roles. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) leukemic B cells have also been shown to express AID transcripts, especially in cases with unmutated immunoglobulin (IG) genes. Therefore, AID expression in CLL might potentially be relevant to the disease. The available data on AID-mRNA splicing patterns in CLL are limited and conflicting. Here, we investigated AID-mRNA isoform expression in a series of 195 CLL patients and explored associations with IG gene mutational status and surface immunoglobulin (sIg) isotype expression. Full-length AID transcripts and two splice variants were detected in 110/91/95 cases, respectively. Co-expression of all three AID-mRNA isoforms was significantly more frequent (p<0.001) in cases with unmutated IGHV genes. No significant differences were identified between sIgG vs. sIgMD cases regarding the frequency of AID-mRNA expression. However, expression of at least one AID-mRNA isoform predominated among mutated IgG vs. mutated IgMD cases (p=0.05). These results attest to the biological heterogeneity of CLL and also indicate that AID splice variants may inhibit SHM in CLL cells of the unmutated subtype.","['Marantidou, Foteini', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Stalika, Evangelia', 'Korkolopoulou, Penelope', 'Saetta, Alina', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Laoutaris, Nikolaos', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Scouras, Zacharias', 'Patsouris, Efstratios']","['Marantidou F', 'Dagklis A', 'Stalika E', 'Korkolopoulou P', 'Saetta A', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Laoutaris N', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Belessi C', 'Scouras Z', 'Patsouris E']","['1st Department of Pathology, Laikon General Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece; Hematology Department, Nikea General Hospital, Piraeus, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alternative Splicing', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'VDJ Exons/genetics']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(09)00243-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2010 Apr 15;44(4):262-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.12.005.

In this study, we investigated the effects of NSAIDs (aspirin or indomethacin) and COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) on growth of YD-8 human oral squamous carcinoma cells. Interestingly, among drugs tested, aspirin showed strongest inhibitory effects on viability and survival of YD-8 cells. Profoundly, aspirin treatment resulted in severe cell shrinkage and nuclear DNA fragmentation in YD-8 cells, suggesting the aspirin-induced apoptosis in YD-8 cells. Data of Western blot further demonstrated that aspirin treatment caused activation of caspases, down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein, dephosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and AKT, and also IkappaB-alpha proteolysis-dependent NF-kappaB activation in YD-8 cells. Aspirin, however, had no effect on expressions of Bcl-2, XIAP, and HIAP-1 in YD-8 cells. Importantly, pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor blocked the aspirin-induced apoptosis and Mcl-1 down-regulation in YD-8 cells. These findings collectively suggest that aspirin induces apoptosis in YD-8 cells and the induction may be correlated to activation of caspases, caspase-dependent Mcl-1 proteolysis, inactivation of ERK-1/2 and AKT, and activation of NF-kappaB. It is suggested that aspirin may be applied a potential anti-cancer drug against human oral squamous carcinoma.","['Park, In-Sook', 'Jo, Jeong-Rang', 'Hong, Hua', 'Nam, Ki-Young', 'Kim, Jong-Bae', 'Hwang, Sang-Hee', 'Choi, Mi-Sun', 'Ryu, Nam-Hee', 'Jang, Hyun-Jung', 'Lee, Sang-Han', 'Kim, Chin-Soo', 'Kwon, Tae-Geon', 'Park, Gy-Young', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl']","['Park IS', 'Jo JR', 'Hong H', 'Nam KY', 'Kim JB', 'Hwang SH', 'Choi MS', 'Ryu NH', 'Jang HJ', 'Lee SH', 'Kim CS', 'Kwon TG', 'Park GY', 'Park JW', 'Jang BC']","['Department of Dentistry, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 194 Dongsan-dong, Jung-gu, Daegu 700-712, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aspirin/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(10)00012-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2010.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Apr;24(3):713-20. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2010.01.010.

More than 100 different translocations involving MLL have been described in acute leukemia, with more than 60 translocation partner genes characterized on the molecular level. In addition to various simple translocations affecting MLL, there are also complex forms involving three or more chromosomes. Here, we describe a novel three-way translocation of t(2;19;11)(p12;p13.3;q23) in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this translocation, the distal 19p13.3 joins the proximal 11q23 on der(11), whereas the distal 11q23 is translocated to 2p12. Three-way translocations involving 11q23 are often difficult to detect with cytogenetic means alone. In the present case, however, the chromosomes involved in the three-way translocation were readily identifiable by GTG banding. The MLL-MLLT1 fusion products from the derivative chromosome 11 were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and two splicing variant forms were confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Furthermore, the novel third partner gene, NRXN1, was detected by systematic breakpoint analysis using long-distance inverse-PCR methods (LDI-PCR). The apparent three-way translocation thus identified is noteworthy because few studies have reported complex rearrangements involving 11q23 and 19p13.3 in acute leukemias.","['Lee, Sang-Guk', 'Park, Tae Sung', 'Won, Sung Chul', 'Song, Jaewoo', 'Lee, Kyung-A', 'Choi, Jong Rak', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Meyer, Claus']","['Lee SG', 'Park TS', 'Won SC', 'Song J', 'Lee KA', 'Choi JR', 'Marschalek R', 'Meyer C']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT1 protein, human)', '0 (NRXN1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00603-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Feb;197(1):32-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.10.009.,10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.10.009 [doi],,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The diagnosis and treatment of 4 cases of childhood acute leukemia complicated by invasive aspergillosis between July 2007 and July 2008 were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Three children who underwent remission induction chemotherapy for ALL and one who underwent consolidation chemotherapy for AML developed invasive aspergillosis. One child with proven aspergillosis and 3 with possible aspergillosis all had halo sign on CT at diagnosis. Voriconazole or amphotericin B was given as primary therapy. Improvements of fungal lesions were shown by CT after two to four weeks of antifungal therapy. Complete radiologic remissions were achieved between 4 months and one year. The intensive chemotherapy schedule was continued in all of 4 cases. The median time from fungal infection to the continuation of chemotherapy was 35 days. None showed recurrence of fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: The halo sign on CT may be a reliable indicator for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The preemptive antifungal therapy on the basis of the identification of a halo sign and the reversal of immunosuppression may improve the outcome of invasive aspergillosis.

METHODS: nm23-H(1) expression was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR in children with ALL (newly diagnosed, n = 40; remission, n = 32; relapse, n = 16; refractory, n = 3). Twenty normal children served as the control group. The relationship between nm23-H(1) expression and immunophenotype was evaluated. RESULTS: The expression of nm23-H(1) in the newly diagnosed ALL group was significantly higher than that in the control (p<0.01) and the remission groups (p<0.01). There was no difference in the nm23-H(1) expression between the remission and the control groups. The expression of nm23-H(1) in the relapse group was significantly higher than that in the control (p<0.01) and the remission groups (p<0.01), and similar to that in the newly diagnosed ALL group.

Here, we characterized the effects of nilotinib for the first time on CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) which regulate anti-tumor/leukemia immune responses. DESIGN AND METHODS: Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and 5-bromo-2-deoxy -uridine (BrdU) were used to assess the proliferation and cell cycle distribution of Tregs. The expression of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) and the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) were measured by flow cytometry. Western blotting analysis was used to detect the effects of nilotinib on the signal transduction cascade of T-cell receptor (TCR) in Tregs. RESULTS: Nilotinib inhibited the proliferation and suppressive capacity of Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. However, the production of cytokines secreted by Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells was only inhibited at high concentrations of nilotinib exceeding the mean therapeutic serum concentrations of the drug in patients. Only high doses of nilotinib arrested both Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells in the G0/G1 phase and down-regulated the expression of FoxP3 and GITR. In western blotting analysis, nilotinib did not show significant inhibitory effects on TCR signaling events in Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that nilotinib does not hamper the function of Tregs at clinical relevant doses, while long-term administration of nilotinib still needs to be investigated.","['Fei, Fei', 'Yu, Yingzhe', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Rojewski, Markus T', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Fei F', 'Yu Y', 'Schmitt A', 'Rojewski MT', 'Chen B', 'Greiner J', 'Gotz M', 'Bunjes D', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF18 protein, human)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2009/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-22 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jan 29;9:22. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-22.,10.1186/1476-4598-9-22 [doi],20100129,,,,,PMC2835656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within 4 months after the initial diagnosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis occurred, and further keratoconjunctivitis and serous retinal detachment recurred due to Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), thus resulting in death 4 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Cases in which patients with leukemia complicated by serous retinal detachment during the course often result in death. In the present case, CMV retinitis and keratoconjunctivitis occurred due to GVHD after serous retinal detachment, thus resulting in death 8 months after the initial diagnosis, therefore if serous retinal detachment is observed in a leukemia patient, it is necessary to perform periodical ophthalmologic examinations even after the ocular symptoms disappear.","['Yoshid, Fumiko', 'Okamoto, Norio', 'Hosotani, Yuka', 'Ueda, Yoshiko', 'Kaida, Katsuji', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Mimura, Osamu']","['Yoshid F', 'Okamoto N', 'Hosotani Y', 'Ueda Y', 'Kaida K', 'Ogawa H', 'Mimura O']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo-ken, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retinal Detachment/*etiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2010 Jan;114(1):28-33.,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although antiproliferative effects of both recombinant nucleases were not significant on the ML-2 cell culture in vitro, the nucleases were strongly cytostatic in vivo after their administration intravenously as stabilized conjugates with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Recombinant nucleases were as effective against melanoma tumors as previously studied pine pollen (PN) and mung bean nucleases and their effects were reached at about 10 times lower concentrations compared to the use of bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase). Because the recombinant nucleases R-HBN1 and R-TBN1 share only 67.4% amino acid identity and showed only partial immunochemical cross-reactivity, their similar anticancerogenic effects can be mainly explained by their catalytical similarity. Both recombinant nucleases showed lower degree of aspermatogenesis compared to BS-RNAse and PN nuclease. Unlike BS-RNase, aspermatogenesis induced by both recombinant nucleases could not be prevented by the homologous antibody complexes. Owing to relatively low cytotoxicity on the one hand, and high efficiency at low protein levels on the other, recombinant plant nucleases R-HBN1 and R-TBN1 appear to be stable biochemical agents that can be targeted as potential antitumor cytostatics.","['Matousek, Jaroslav', 'Podzimek, Tomas', 'Pouckova, Pavla', 'Stehlik, Jan', 'Skvor, Jiri', 'Soucek, Josef', 'Matousek, Josef']","['Matousek J', 'Podzimek T', 'Pouckova P', 'Stehlik J', 'Skvor J', 'Soucek J', 'Matousek J']","['Biology Centre, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic v.v.i., Institute of Plant Molecular Biology, 370 05 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. matousek@iapg.cas.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Endonucleases/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Humulus/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Lycopersicon esculentum/enzymology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/enzymology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/02/02 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504009790217425 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2009;18(4):163-71. doi: 10.3727/096504009790217425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most of these patients display KIT mutations, especially KIT(D816V), little is known about their exact frequency and their distribution in AHNMD subtypes. We examined 48 patients with SM-AHNMD for the presence of mutant KIT in the SM and AHNMD components of the disease. Mast cells and AHNMD cells were obtained from immunostained bone marrow sections by laser microdissection and examined by melting point analysis of nested-PCR products. KIT(D816V) was found in AHNMD cells in the vast majority of patients with SM-chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML, 89%). Unexpectedly, KIT(D816V) was far less frequently detectable in AHNMD cells in patients with SM-myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, 20%) and SM-acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, 30%). None of the patients with lymphoproliferative AHNMDs displayed KIT codon 816 mutations in AHNMD cells (0/8). In FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL), neither the SM nor the CEL component of the disease exhibited the KIT mutation. Our findings demonstrate that KIT codon 816 mutations are variably present in AHNMD cells in patients with SM-AHNMD, depending on the subtype of AHNMD. The high frequency of KIT(D816V) in neoplastic mast cells and leukaemic myelomonocytic cells in SM-CMML may point to a common precursor in these patients, and may have implications for the biology of the disease and the development of KIT-targeting therapies.","['Sotlar, Karl', 'Colak, Sema', 'Bache, Anja', 'Berezowska, Sabina', 'Krokowski, Manuela', 'Bultmann, Burkhard', 'Valent, Peter', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Sotlar K', 'Colak S', 'Bache A', 'Berezowska S', 'Krokowski M', 'Bultmann B', 'Valent P', 'Horny HP']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Germany.

In this study, we identified that cPLA(2)alpha acted as a modulator of LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) adherence. Treatment of RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) with LPS, a TLR4 agonist, promoted the VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 adherence which were decreased by pretreatment with a selective cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) inhibitor (AACOCF(3)), implying the involvement of cPLA(2)alpha in these responses. This notion was further confirmed by knockdown of cPLA(2)alpha expression by transfection with cPLA(2)alpha small interfering RNA (siRNA) leading to a decrease in VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 adherence induced by LPS. Subsequently, the LPS-stimulated cPLA(2)alpha phosphorylation was attenuated by pretreatment with a MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), suggesting that LPS-stimulated cPLA(2)alpha phosphorylation and activity are mediated through an ERK-dependent mechanism. Moreover, COX-2-derived PGE(2) production appeared to involve in LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression which was attenuated by pretreatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398 and celecoxib), transfection with COX-2 siRNA, or PGE(2) receptor antagonists. In addition, pretreatment with ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a substrate competitor of arachidonic acid (AA), also blocked LPS-induced VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expression, and THP-1 adherence. Collectively, these results suggest that LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression and adhesion of THP-1 cells are mediated through the TLR4/ERK/cPLA(2)alpha phosphorylation and COX-2 expression/PGE(2) synthesis in RASFs.","['Wu, Cheng-Ying', 'Chi, Pei-Ling', 'Hsieh, Hsi-Lung', 'Luo, Shue-Fen', 'Yang, Chuen-Mao']","['Wu CY', 'Chi PL', 'Hsieh HL', 'Luo SF', 'Yang CM']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Chang Gung University, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '00XIW1CR0F (arachidonyltrifluoromethane)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (AOC3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group IV Phospholipases A2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Group IV Phospholipases A2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22059 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 May;223(2):480-91. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22059.,10.1002/jcp.22059 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-nine patients with CD7(+) CD56(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were analyzed. There were 17 patients of M0, which corresponded to myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia, and 32 patients of AML other than M0 (9 each for M1 and M2, one for M3, 3 for M4, 4 for M5 and 6 for M7). Age distribution was similar between these two groups, but CD7(+) CD56(+) M0 showed significant male predominance than CD7(+) CD56(+) M1-M7 (M:F = 15:2 vs. 15:17, P = 0.006). The disease localization and the hematological manifestations were different, showing fewer white blood cell counts and circulating leukemic blasts, less anemia, less thrombocytopenia and more frequent extramedullary involvement in M0 group. The prognosis was poor in both groups, and there was no statistical difference. These findings suggest that extramedullary involvement of myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia is not directly derived from the presence of CD7 and CD56 antigens on leukemic cells. The poor prognosis of CD7(+) CD56(+) M1-M7 suggests that this phenotype may act as a prognostic factor for AML, but this should be confirmed in further studies.","['Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Nagai, Masami', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Hamaguchi, Motohiro', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Karasuno, Takahiro', 'Shimodaira, Shigetaka', 'Ohno, Ryuzo', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Suzuki R', 'Ohtake S', 'Takeuchi J', 'Nagai M', 'Kodera Y', 'Hamaguchi M', 'Miyawaki S', 'Karasuno T', 'Shimodaira S', 'Ohno R', 'Nakamura S', 'Naoe T']","['Department of HSCT Data Management, Nagoya University School of Medicine, 1-1-20 Daiko-minami, Higashi-ku, Nagoya 461-0047, Japan. r-suzuki@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Data Collection', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2009/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0492-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Mar;91(2):303-9. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0492-1.

Only the biggest alpha-dystrobrevin isoform (DB-alpha), which can be important for its function, was expressed in the membrane fraction of NB4 cells; the other alpha-DB isoforms were found in the hydrophilic cell fractions. Employing the immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified novel alpha-DB-interacting proteins involved in cytoskeleton reorganization (actin, tropomyosin, gelsolin, tubulin) and signal transduction process (stathmin, prohibitin, RIBA) during proliferation and differentiation of NB4 cells. Our results suggest that alpha-DB isoforms play a central role in cytoskeleton reorganization via their multiple interactions with actin and actin-associating proteins and may participate in signal transduction process during NB4 cell granulocytic differentiation via directly and non directly associated proteins.","['Borutinskaite, V V', 'Magnusson, K-E', 'Navakauskiene, R']","['Borutinskaite VV', 'Magnusson KE', 'Navakauskiene R']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, LT-08662 Vilnius, Lithuania. verbu@imk.liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Dystrophin)', '0 (Dystrophin-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (dystrobrevin)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Dystrophin/genetics/metabolism', 'Dystrophin-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/01/30 06:00,2011/10/22 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-010-9965-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2011 Jun;38(5):3001-11. doi: 10.1007/s11033-010-9965-9.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: One study estimated the optimum target level of imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukaemia as 1002 ng/mL (1.70 microM) through ROC analysis. Using individual-patient level data reported in another study and the same methodology, we estimated the target level as 0.95 microM. This is consistent with the results of other observational studies where dose-response was not the primary research objective. The available evidence suggests considerable inter-individual variability in dose-blood level response. In addition to the pharmacogenetics of metabolic enzymes and transporters, genetic mutations in genes participating in the signalling pathways may also account for the wide inter-individual variability in dose-blood level and dose-clinical response relationships. CONCLUSION: A single-dose regimen for all pharmacogenetically eligible patients is not the optimum strategy for prescribing imatinib to patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia. We suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring aimed at ensuring a trough target level of 1 microM would reduce the incidence of pseudo-resistance and hence personalize treatment and optimise response to imatinib. Persistent resistance can then be probed further for other causes.","['Li-Wan-Po, Alain', 'Farndon, Peter', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Griffiths, Michael']","['Li-Wan-Po A', 'Farndon P', 'Craddock C', 'Griffiths M']","[""National Genetics Education and Development Centre, c/o Birmingham Women's Hospital, Edgbaston, UK. a.liwanpo@talk21.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Piperazines/*blood', 'Pyrimidines/*blood', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-009-0779-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2010 Apr;66(4):369-74. doi: 10.1007/s00228-009-0779-4.

PBMCs were collected from 16 healthy young adults and cultured with bloodroot extracts or respective controls for interleukins-1beta, -2, -8, -10, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor. Proliferative capabilities of both PBMCs and K562 cells (an immortalized human myelogenous leukemia cell line) following extract treatment were determined. High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to quantify berberine, chelerythrine, and sanguinarine in the extracts and to correlate extract composition with observed effects. Overall, infusions demonstrated greater immunomodulatory capabilities than tinctures, and flower- and root-based extracts showed greater immunomodulatory properties than leaf- or rhizome-based extracts (some effects seen with root-based extracts may be due to endotoxin). Several extracts were able to augment PBMC proliferation and diminish K562 proliferation, suggesting a selective anti-carcinogenic activity. The rhizome alcohol tincture had a markedly stronger effect against K562 cells than other extracts. Chelerythrine, sanguinarine, and endotoxin (but not berberine) sometimes correlated with observed effects. The in vitro activities demonstrated here suggest bloodroot extracts may have potential as therapeutic immunomodulators.","['Senchina, David S', 'Flinn, Gina N', 'McCann, Dustin A', 'Kohut, Marian L', 'Shearn, Colin T']","['Senchina DS', 'Flinn GN', 'McCann DA', 'Kohut ML', 'Shearn CT']","['Department of Biology, Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Herbs Spices Med Plants,"Journal of herbs, spices & medicinal plants",9302329,,,,2010/01/30 06:00,2010/01/30 06:01,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10496470902787485 [doi]'],ppublish,J Herbs Spices Med Plants. 2009 Jan 1;15(1):45. doi: 10.1080/10496470902787485.,,,,,,"['P01 ES012020/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 ES012020-02/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2811966,,,['NIHMS98389'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the early description of oncogenic viral forms of fes, v-fes, and v-fps, the implication of FES and FER in human pathology is not known. We have recently shown that FES but not FER is necessary for oncogenic KIT receptor signaling. Here, we report that both FES and FER kinases are activated in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and in AML cell lines. FES and FER activation is dependent on FLT3 in cell lines harboring constitutively active FLT3 mutants. Moreover, both FES and FER proteins are critical for FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) signaling and for cell proliferation in relevant AML cell lines. FER is required for cell cycle transitions, whereas FES seems necessary for cell survival. We concluded that FES and FER kinases mediate essential non-redundant functions downstream of FLT3-ITD.","['Voisset, E', 'Lopez, S', 'Chaix, A', 'Georges, C', 'Hanssens, K', 'Prebet, T', 'Dubreuil, P', 'De Sepulveda, P']","['Voisset E', 'Lopez S', 'Chaix A', 'Georges C', 'Hanssens K', 'Prebet T', 'Dubreuil P', 'De Sepulveda P']","[""INSERM, UMR 891, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Laboratoire de Signalisation, Hematopoiese et Mecanismes de l'Oncogenese, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '110736-90-8 (proto-oncogene protein c-fes-fps)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Inverted Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009301 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.301 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):721-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.301.

At a once-daily dose and a relatively short half-life of 3-5 h, tyrosine kinase inhibition is not sustained. However, transient inhibition of K562 leukemia cells with a high-dose pulse of dasatinib or long-term treatment with a lower dose was reported to irreversibly induce apoptosis. Here, the effect of dasatinib on treatment of Bcr/Abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells was evaluated in the presence of stromal support. Dasatinib eradicated Bcr/Abl ALL cells, caused significant apoptosis and eliminated tyrosine phosphorylation on Bcr/Abl, Src, Crkl and Stat-5. However, treatment of mouse ALL cells with lower doses of dasatinib over an extended period of time allowed the emergence of viable drug-resistant cells. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment increased cell-surface expression of CXCR4, which is important for survival of B-lineage cells, but this did not promote survival. Combined treatment of cells with dasatinib and a CXCR4 inhibitor resulted in enhanced cell death. These results do not support the concept that long-term treatment with low-dose dasatinib monotherapy will be effective in causing irreversible apoptosis in Ph-positive ALL, but suggest that combined treatment with dasatinib and drugs such as AMD3100 may be effective.","['Fei, F', 'Stoddart, S', 'Muschen, M', 'Kim, Y-m', 'Groffen, J', 'Heisterkamp, N']","['Fei F', 'Stoddart S', 'Muschen M', 'Kim YM', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Saban Research Institute of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009302 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.302 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):813-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.302.

Cucurbitacin E at high concentrations (1-10 mol/l) induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells and activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. Jurkat leukemia cells with or without caspase-8 expression were nearly equally sensitive to cucurbitacin E-induced apoptosis. Cucurbitacin E did not increase the levels of reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and catalase, did not block cucurbitacin E-induced apoptosis. Cucurbitacin E decreased the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP, survivin, and Mcl-1, but increased the level of the proapoptotic protein, Bax. The levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit (eIF2) were induced in cells undergoing both apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. As phosphorylated eIF2 is an inhibitor of protein translation initiation, our data suggest that cucurbitacin E induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis through the induction of eIF2 phosphorylation, which leads to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1, Mcl-1, survivin, and/or XIAP protein synthesis and that cucurbitacin E induces apoptosis mainly through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway.","['Li, Yanchun', 'Wang, Rui', 'Ma, Enlong', 'Deng, Yihui', 'Wang, Xiaolong', 'Xiao, Jinfang', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Li Y', 'Wang R', 'Ma E', 'Deng Y', 'Wang X', 'Xiao J', 'Jing Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'V8A45XYI21 (cucurbitacin E)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/drug effects/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328336b383 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2010 Apr;21(4):389-400. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328336b383.,10.1097/CAD.0b013e328336b383 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of CLL is highly variable: cases that express mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgV(H)) typically have a more indolent clinical course compared with those with unmutated IgV(H). The use of the V(H)3-21 variable region has also been found to confer a poor prognosis, independent of mutation status. Here we describe an assay for the identification of the expressed V(H) segment and its mutation status in CLL. This test uses whole blood-derived RNA and PCR primers annealing to the leader regions and the joining region segments. This approach allows more accurate determination of the IgV(H) mutation status relative to using framework region specific V(H) primers. An additional primer specific for the leader region of the V(H)3-21 segment is described and is shown to be necessary to identify this diagnostically important variable region. We successfully analyzed 99 of 103 samples, including five expressing the V(H)3-21 variable region. Approximately 5% of cases had complement determining region 3 sequences similar to previously reported cases, and overrepresentation of the V(H)1-69 segment was observed among unmutated cases. These results confirm the proper functioning and high success rate of this valuable prognostic for CLL designed for the use in a clinical laboratory setting.","['Szankasi, Philippe', 'Bahler, David W']","['Szankasi P', 'Bahler DW']","['Associated Regional and University Pathologists Laboratories, 500 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA. philippe.szankasi@aruplab.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/immunology', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60054-2 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090091 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2010 Mar;12(2):244-9. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090091.

Lipid rafts also occur in embryonic stem (ES) cells, but their role in ES cells is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of lipid rafts in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal. In the present study, we observed that the presence of lipid rafts/caveolae. The results from sucrose gradient fractionation showed that the expression of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta) was decreased by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Mbeta-CD) but, interestingly, was not affected by caveolin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In addition, LIF increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt, and the expression level of c-Myc, which were attenuated by the pretreatment with Mbeta-CD. However, caveolin-1 siRNA did not influence LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and Akt, and expression of c-Myc. Treatment with Mbeta-CD and caveolin-1 siRNA decreased expression levels of Oct4 protein and Oct4, Sox2, FoxD3, and Rex1 mRNAs in normal culture conditions. Additionally, Mbeta-CD and caveolin-1 siRNA decreased the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and the proliferation index [(S + G2/M)/(G0/G1 + S + G2/M)] of ES cells.

Herein, we report that during apoptosis, MYHIIA becomes exposed on the cell surface of a subgroup of apoptotic cells, allowing subset 6 CLL mAbs to bind with it. Because other non-subset 6 CLL mAbs interact with apoptotic cells, 26 CLL mAbs, including 24 not belonging to subset 6, were tested for reactivity with MYHIIA-exposed apoptotic cells (MEACs). More than 60% of CLL mAbs bound MEACs well; most of these mAbs expressed unmutated IGHV (15 of 16) and belonged to a stereotyped subset (14 of 16). Binding to MEACs inversely correlated with the degree of IGHV mutation. Interestingly, high binding to MEACs significantly correlated with poor patient survival, suggesting that the basis of IGHV mutation status as a CLL prognostic factor reflects antigen binding. Finally, natural antibodies from human serum also reacted with MEACs. Taken together, our data indicate that a large proportion of CLL clones emerge from natural antibody-producing cells expressing immunoglobulins that recognize MEACs, and that this reactivity is associated with poor clinical outcome.","['Chu, Charles C', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Didier, Sebastien', 'Agagnina, Briana M', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Kaufman, Matthew S', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Chu CC', 'Catera R', 'Zhang L', 'Didier S', 'Agagnina BM', 'Damle RN', 'Kaufman MS', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. cchu@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibody-Producing Cells/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35026-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-244251 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 May 13;115(19):3907-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-244251.

RESULTS: The combined odds ratio (OR) based on the random effects model indicated that day-care attendance is associated with a reduced risk of ALL [OR = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 0.87]. In subgroup analyses evaluating the influence of timing of exposure, a similarly reduced effect was observed for both day-care attendance occurring early in life (< or =2 years of age) (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.95) and day-care attendance with unspecified timing (anytime prior to diagnosis) (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Similar findings were observed with seven studies in which common ALL were analysed separately. The reduced risk estimates persisted in sensitivity analyses that examined the sources of study heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides strong support for an association between exposure to common infections in early childhood and a reduced risk of ALL. Implications of a 'hygiene'-related aetiology suggest that some form of prophylactic intervention in infancy may be possible.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Gallagher, Emily R', 'Ayoob, Julie M', 'Ma, Xiaomei']","['Urayama KY', 'Buffler PA', 'Gallagher ER', 'Ayoob JM', 'Ma X']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. urayamak@fellows.iarc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Day Care Centers/*statistics & numerical data', 'Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['dyp378 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyp378 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2010 Jun;39(3):718-32. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyp378.

In the present study, we conducted a quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of expression of 23 human precursor miRNAs in bone marrow specimens of 85 Chinese primary leukemia patients, including 53 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 32 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. We show that 16 miRNAs were differentially expressed between AMLs and ALLs. Of them, eight were previously reported (i.e., miR-23a, miR-27a/b, miR-128a, miR-128b, miR-221, miR-222, miR-223, and let-7b) and eight were newly identified (i.e., miR-17, miR-20a, miR-29a/c, miR-29b, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-196b). More importantly, through correlating miRNA expression signatures with outcome of patients, we further show that expression signatures of a group of miRNAs are associated with overall survival of patients. Of them, three (i.e., miR-146a, miR-181a/c, and miR-221), five (i.e., miR-25, miR-26a, miR-29b, miR-146a, and miR-196b), and three (i.e., miR-26a, miR-29b, and miR-146a) miRNAs are significantly associated with overall survival (P<0.05) of the 32 ALL, 53 AML, and 40 non-M3 AML patients, respectively. Particularly, the expression signature of miR-146a is significantly inversely correlated with overall survival of both ALL and AML patients. The prognostic significance of miR-146a in AML has been confirmed further in an independent study of 61 Chinese new AML patient samples. We also identified 622 putative target genes of miR-146a that are predicted by at least three out of the five major prediction programs (i.e., TragetScan, PicTar, miRanda, miRBase Targets, and PITA).

Nilotinib is metabolized in the liver via oxidation and hydroxylation pathways, mediated primarily by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. Interpatient variability in systemic exposure to nilotinib has been reported to range from 32% to 64%. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib in subjects with hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. METHODS: Hepatic impairment was classified as mild (Child-Pugh grade A), moderate (Child-Pugh grade B), or severe (Child-Pugh grade C). Healthy control subjects were matched with hepatically impaired subjects by age (+/-10 years) and body weight (+/-20%). All subjects received a single oral dose of nilotinib 200 mg under fasted conditions, and serial blood samples were collected at specific times up to 120 hours after dosing. Serum nilotinib concentrations were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS assay with a lower limit of quantification of 2.5 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were C(max), T(max), AUC(0-last), AUC(0-infinity), t(1/2), CL/F, and Vz/F. Tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), regular monitoring of clinical laboratory measures (eg, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis), physical examinations, vital signs, and ECGs. Each AE was evaluated in terms of its clinical significance, severity, duration, relation to study drug, and action taken. RESULTS: The study enrolled 18 subjects with hepatic impairment (all male; age range, 47-67 years; weight range, 73.9-103.9 kg) and 9 healthy controls (all male; age range, 36-62 years; weight range, 73.3-109.5 kg). Among subjects with hepatic impairment, 6 had mild impairment, 6 moderate impairment, and 6 severe impairment. The nilotinib AUC(0-infinity) was a mean of 35%, 35%, and 19% higher in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe impairment, respectively, compared with healthy controls. The nilotinib CL/F was lower in all hepatic-impairment groups compared with healthy controls. The mean (SD) t(1/2) was 15.1 (4.97) and 16.0 (9.13) hours in the mild-impairment and control groups, respectively, but was 21.6 (7.77) and 32.4 (10.7) hours in the moderate- and severe-impairment groups, respectively, reflecting the decrease in CL/F and/or increase in Vz/F in the latter 2 groups. All AEs were mild or moderate, and the frequency of AEs was not associated with the degree of hepatic impairment. AEs included abdominal pain (1 subject with mild impairment), dyspepsia (2 with mild impairment), flatulence (1 with severe impairment), nausea (1 with mild impairment), urinary tract infection (1 with mild impairment), back pain (1 each with mild impairment and severe impairment, 1 control subject), and headache (1 each with mild impairment and severe impairment). CONCLUSIONS: After a single 200-mg dose, nilotinib pharmacokinetics were modestly affected by hepatic impairment. The extent of change in nilotinib exposure in subjects with hepatic impairment was generally within the range of variability that has been observed clinically. The results of this study suggest that dose adjustment may not be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. Nilotinib should be used with caution, and careful clinical monitoring is recommended in this population.

METHODS: A systematic literature search for papers on HCL was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and the Cochrane computerized database. Search terms were HCL plus 1 of the following: incidence, prevalence, epidemiology, cladribine, interferon, pentostatin, rituximab, splenectomy, utility, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, resource utilization, economic, or cost. Published clinical outcomes and estimates of health care resource use obtained from 10 consultant hematologists across the United Kingdom were used to construct a 5-year Markov model depicting the current management of HCL in the United Kingdom. Utilities for health states in the model were obtained from the general public using standard gamble, time tradeoff, and visual analog scale techniques. The model was used to consider the decision by a clinician to initially treat an HCL patient with either pentostatin or cladribine and to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of pentostatin over 5 years (at 2007/2008 prices) from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). RESULTS: According to the model, 64% of all pentostatin-treated patients are expected to be in relapse-free remission at 5 years compared with 49% of cladribine-treated patients (P = 0.04). Repeat treatment of initial partial responders, nonresponders, and those who relapse during the 5 years is expected to result in complete remission in 92% of pentostatintreated patients and 90% of cladribine-treated patients at 5 years. Using pentostatin instead of cladribine is expected to lead to a minimal cost increase (from 21,325 pounds to 21,609 pounds) and an improvement in health status (from 3.64 to 3.77 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) over 5 years. Hence, the cost per QALY gained from using pentostatin is expected to be 5000 pounds. Moreover, pentostatin has a 0.90 probability of being cost-effective for a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. Accordingly, using pentostatin as a first-line treatment for patients with HCL is an effective use of NHS resources. CONCLUSION: Based on current practice, this model predicts that pentostatin is a cost-effective treatment compared with cladribine in the management of HCL from the perspective of the UK's NHS.","['Guest, Julian F', 'Smith, Helen', 'Sladkevicius, Erikas', 'Jackson, Graham']","['Guest JF', 'Smith H', 'Sladkevicius E', 'Jackson G']","['Catalyst Health Economics Consultants, Northwood, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Postgraduate Medical School, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom. julian.guest@catalyst-health.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*economics', 'Models, Economic', 'Pentostatin/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(09)00406-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2009;31 Pt 2:2398-415. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.016.,10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.016 [doi],,,,,,,['Copyright 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

The incidence of AML increases with age, and older patients typically have worse treatment outcomes than do younger patients. OBJECTIVE: This review is focused on current and emerging treatment strategies for nonpromyelocytic AML in patients aged <60 years. METHODS: A literature review was conducted of the PubMed database for articles published in English. Publications from 1990 through March 2009 were scrutinized, and the search was updated on August 26, 2009. The search terms used were: acute myeloid leukemia in conjunction with treatment, chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy. Clinical trials including adults with AML aged > or =19 years were selected for analysis. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of The American Society of Hematology, The European Hematology Association, and The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. RESULTS: Cytarabine (AraC) is the cornerstone of induction therapy and consolidation therapy for AML. A standard form of induction therapy consists of AraC (100-200 mg/m(2)), administered by a continuous infusion for 7 days, combined with an anthracycline, administered intravenously for 3 days. Consolidation therapy comprises treatment with additional courses of intensive chemotherapy after the patient has achieved a complete remission (CR), usually with higher doses of the same drugs as were used during the induction period. High-dose AraC (2-3 g/m(2)) is now a standard consolidation therapy for patients aged <60 years. Despite substantial progress in the treatment of newly diagnosed AML, 20% to 40% of patients do not achieve remission with the standard induction chemotherapy, and 50% to 70% of first CR patients are expected to relapse within 3 years. The optimum strategy at the time of relapse, or for patients with the resistant disease, remains uncertain. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been established as the most effective form of antileukemic therapy in patients with AML in first or subsequent remission. New drugs are being evaluated in clinical studies, including immunotoxins, monoclonal antibodies, nucleoside analogues, hypomethylating agents, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, alkylating agents, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitors, and multidrug-resistant modulators. However, determining the success of these treatment strategies ultimately requires well-designed clinical trials, based on stratification of the patient risk, knowledge of the individual disease, and the drug's performance status. CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of AraC and anthracyclines are still the mainstay of induction therapy, and use of high-dose AraC is now a standard consolidation therapy in AML patients aged <60 years. Although several new agents have shown promise in treating AML, it is unlikely that these agents will be curative when administered as monotherapy; it is more likely that they will be used in combination with other new agents or with conventional therapy.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka']","['Robak T', 'Wierzbowska A']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(09)00407-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2009;31 Pt 2:2349-70. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.017.,10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.017 [doi],,166,,,,,['Copyright 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Bendamustine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in March 2008 and for the treatment of rituximab-refractory, indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in October 2008. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic properties of bendamustine, together with data on efficacy and toxicity from trials investigating the use of bendamustine for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies, including CLL, NHL, and multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 15, 2009) were searched using the terms bendamustine, bendamustin, Treanda, Ribomustin, SDX-105, IMET-3393, and Cytostasan. References from relevant articles were also reviewed for additional sources and material. The databases of the American Society of Hematology (2004-2008) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1995-2008) were searched for relevant abstracts. RESULTS: Bendamustine is a mechlorethamine derivative with structural similarity to chlorambucil and other drugs from the nitrogen mustard class, as well as a benzimidazole ring, which may act as an antagonist to purines and amino acids. It has good oral bioavailability but has been studied almost exclusively in the intravenous formulation. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 1A2 to active metabolites gamma-hydroxy bendamustine and N-desmethyl-bendamustine, but clinical activity appears to be associated primarily with the parent compound. The t(1/2) of bendamustine is approximately 40 minutes. While bendamustine has 2 moieties with possible antitumor effect, it is unclear to what extent the benzimidazole ring enhances the efficacy of the drug. Numerous studies including in vitro assays have reported, however, that bendamustine has little cross-resistance with other alkylating agents and remains active even in extensively pretreated patients. FDA approval for use in CLL was based on findings from a randomized, open-label, Phase III study comparing bendamustine with chlorambucil as single-agent therapy in treatmentnaive patients with CLL (Binet stage B or C). Bendamustine was administered intravenously at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, while chlorambucil was administered orally at 0.8 mg/kg daily, both over 4-week cycles for up to 6 cycles. At interim analysis (the data used for FDA approval), bendamustine was associated with a greater overall response (68% vs 39%; P < 0.001), median progression-free survival (21.7 vs 9.3 months; P < 0.001) and median duration of remission (18.9 vs 6.1 months; P < 0.001) compared with chlorambucil. FDA approval for rituximabrefractory, indolent B-cell NHL followed a Phase III, open-label, single-arm study evaluating bendamustine monotherapy in patients who did not respond to rituximab or had progressive disease within 6 months of rituximab therapy. Bendamustine 120 mg/m(2) was administered intravenously on days 1 and 2 of a 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles. At interim analysis, the overall response rate was 84%, including 29% complete response. The median progression-free survival was 9.7 months. The efficacy of bendamustine has also been reported in the treatment of MM in clinical studies, and bendamustine has been approved in Europe for treating MM, NHL, CLL, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Dose-limiting toxicity is primarily hematologic. Treatment-associated infections have been reported in some studies; however, nonhematologic adverse events have rarely been dose limiting. The most common nonhematologic adverse events include fatigue, nausea, xerostomia, and pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS: Bendamustine is a mechlorethamine derivative with a purine-like benzimidazole ring, which may enhance its clinical efficacy. It has been approved in the United States for the treatment of CLL and rituximab-refractory, indolent B-cell NHL.

This translocation determines a fusion gene, bcr-abl, which encodes a constitutively active protein, tyrosine kinase, resulting in decreased apoptosis, defective adhesion, and genomic instability in transformed cells. The tyrosine kinase activity and its effects represent a potential pharmacologic target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Flare of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is well described in immunosuppressed patients treated with corticosteroids and rituximab, but has not yet been reported during treatment with imatinib. OBJECTIVE: We report a case of cutaneous KS lesions in a patient affected by CML treated with imatinib. CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old white male patient (weight, 90 kg) was diagnosed with CML in March 2006 at the Division of Hematology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy. He was treated with imatinib 400 mg/d, which improved his general condition with few adverse effects. After 12 months of treatment, molecular biology showed an important reduction in the peripheral blood of the fusion oncoprotein bcr-abl p210-b3a2. However, at the same time, multiple cutaneous violaceous papular-nodular lesions appeared on his left forearm. A punch biopsy showed the presence of KS, whereas a polymerase chain reaction assay documented the presence of human herpes virus type 8 (HHV8) DNA in the skin lesion. Serologic HIV was negative and HHV8 viremia was under the limit of quantitation of the assay. Total body computed tomography scan did not reveal any mucosal or visceral lesion. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of a patient with CML who developed KS 12 months after starting treatment with imatinib 400 mg/d. The mechanism behind the development of the cutaneous lesions is unclear, and could have either a casual clinical association or be related to the study drug. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, the development of KS in this case was probably associated with the imatinib treatment (score, 5-8).","['Campione, Elena', 'Diluvio, Laura', 'Paterno, Evelin J', 'Di Marcantonio, Dely', 'Francesconi, Arianna', 'Terrinoni, Alessandro', 'Orlandi, Augusto', 'Chimenti, Sergio']","['Campione E', 'Diluvio L', 'Paterno EJ', 'Di Marcantonio D', 'Francesconi A', 'Terrinoni A', 'Orlandi A', 'Chimenti S']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. campioneelena@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*complications/pathology', 'Skin/pathology']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/04/10 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(09)00408-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2009 Nov;31(11):2565-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.018.,10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.018 [doi],,,,,,,['Copyright 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (>18 years) with platinum-resistant/refractory (relapsed<6 months), or platinum-sensitive (relapsed >6 months) disease after first-line platinum-based and P chemotherapy. Pts received 6-8 cycles of gefitinib (500 mg/day), P (175 mg/m(2) 3 h infusion) and C (AUC 5) every 3 weeks, followed by gefitinib alone. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST or Rustin criteria). RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (26 resistant/refractory and 42 sensitive) were enrolled (median age: 57 years). ORR and disease control rates were 19.2% and 69.2% for resistant/refractory, and 61.9% and 81.0%, for sensitive disease. Median time to progression and overall median survivals were 6.1 and 16.9 months for resistant/refractory and 9.2 and 25.7 months for sensitive disease. Grade 3/4 toxicities (in > or = 10% patients) were neutropenia (59%), diarrhea (25%), leukopenia (22%), anemia (13%), and acne (13%). Two secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and one secondary acute leukemia occurred during treatment, and one MDS 34 months after treatment discontinuation.

II.,51-8,"Currently, it is possible to find a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor for virtually all patients with acute leukemia who have an indication to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and lack a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or a well-matched HLA unrelated donor (URD). According to the ethnicity of the patients and the donor registry, approximately 25% to 60% of patients will not find an 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor. Other alternative donors, such as HLA-mismatched related donor or unrelated donor umbilical cord blood (UCB), have emerged to solve the lack of a sibling or well-matched URD. In the haploidentical HSCT setting, new techniques of T-cell depletion, new approaches using combinations of immunosuppressive drugs or different conditioning regimens, and developments on immunotherapy have focused attention on this option. Therefore, any physician has to carefully evaluate, for each patient in need of an allograft, all of the possible alternatives in order to choose the best HSC donor, taking into account type of disease to be transplanted, urgency of transplantation, donor characteristics, and center experience. This review evaluates the current status of haploidentical HSCT in acute leukemia, its advantages and remaining limitations compared to other stem cell sources, and how these data may be used in the development of donor selection algorithms.","['Hough, Rachael', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Hough R', 'Rocha V']","['University College London, London, United Kingdom.

I.,46-50,"Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has gradually emerged over the last decade as an alternative source of hematopoietic cells for transplantation in children and adults with high-risk or advanced hematologic malignancies who do not have a suitably matched related or unrelated adult donor. This increase in use of UCB is due to favorable results in children, growing availability of UCB units with large cell doses, less stringent donor-recipient HLA matching, and rapid identification and acquisition of the unit. In children with acute leukemia, the data support similar leukemia-free survival after transplantation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched and one or two HLA-mismatched UCB and HLA-matched unrelated donor bone marrow. In adults with acute leukemia, some reports suggest a survival advantage after transplantation of matched unrelated bone marrow compared to UCB, while others report similar leukemia-free survival. Work is in progress to improve hematopoietic recovery and lower early transplant-related deaths, the two major limitations to a successful outcome after UCB transplant. The importance of HLA-matching and cell dose on outcomes after UCB transplantation support the need for an even greater investment in public cord blood banks. Simultaneously searching of accredited cord blood banks and bone marrow donor registries for patients without an HLA-matched sibling thought to benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is encouraged.","['Eapen, Mary', 'Wagner, John E']","['Eapen M', 'Wagner JE']","['Statistical Center, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. meapen@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Donors/supply & distribution', 'Child', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*surgery', 'Patient Selection', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(09)00138-3 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2009.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2010 Jan;47(1):46-50. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2009.10.007.,10.1053/j.seminhematol.2009.10.007 [doi],,18,,,"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2814074,['(c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This study was to assess the value of monitoring BCR-ABL fusion gene level in CML patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) using FISH and RQ-PCR. METHODS: BCR-ABL fusion gene levels were detected in the bone marrow of 31 patients with CML before and 3-48 months after allo-HSCT using FISH and RQ-PCR. RESULTS: BCR-ABL positive cells detected by FISH were decreased 3-30 months after allo-HSCT and BCR-ABL/ABL mRNA was reduced by 2 logarithmic units in RQ-PCR (P < 0.05). While no BCR-ABL positive cell was detected by FISH 30 months after allo-HSCT, BCR-ABL/ABL mRNA was detected by RQ-PCR and declined by more than 3 logarithmic units, (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic monitoring of BCR-ABL gene on molecular level in CML patients after allo-HSCT is useful in the early prediction of susceptibility to recurrence in the patients and in designing intervention, and is thus helpful in improving the overall survival rate after transplantation.","['Zhu, Hong-Qian', 'Liu, Xiao-Li', 'Song, Lan-Lin', 'Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Meng, Fan-Yi', 'Zhou, Shu-Yun']","['Zhu HQ', 'Liu XL', 'Song LL', 'Liu QF', 'Meng FY', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Chin J Cancer,Chinese journal of cancer,101498232,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/30 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1000-467X201002194 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.009.10250 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer. 2010 Feb;29(2):194-7. doi: 10.5732/cjc.009.10250.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: CD20 as a therapeutic target for CLL, successes and limitations of current anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, and implications of preclinical and clinical developments of novel alternatives, including ofatumumab, that may enhance anti-CD20 mAb therapy are reviewed. The literature reviewed encompasses papers and congress abstracts from the past 13 years. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: While rituximab combined with chemotherapy has considerably improved outcomes for some but not all CLL patients, single-agent use is limited in relapsed/refractory CLL. Novel anti-CD20 mAbs in development, such as ofatumumab, may bypass some limitations by virtue of alternative epitope binding and modified effector functions. Ofatumumab induces significant complement-dependent cell lysis in vitro, particularly in cells with low CD20 expression. The FDA recently approved ofatumumab for treatment of CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: CD20-targetting chemoimmunotherapeutic options have advanced treatment of CLL. Results for single-agent ofatumumab and other new CD20 mAbs, in different lines of therapy and in combination with chemotherapy, will guide optimal use of these alternative therapies for B-cell malignancies.","['Osterborg, Anders']",['Osterborg A'],"['Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden. anders.osterborg@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy']",2010/01/30 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2010/01/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712590903586239 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2010 Mar;10(3):439-49. doi: 10.1517/14712590903586239.,10.1517/14712590903586239 [doi],,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, human primordial and preantral follicles fail to grow after isolation from the surrounding ovarian stroma. Granulosa cells, which normally undergo apoptosis after ovulation, contain a subpopulation of ovarian follicular cells remaining viable in vitro over prolonged periods when cultured in the presence of leukemia-inhibiting factor. However, when cultured as monolayers, they progressively lose all their characteristics, such as follicle-stimulating hormone receptor and cytochrome P450-aromatase. Here, we describe a three-dimensional culture system containing type I collagen, which, together with leukemia-inhibiting factor, allowed the survival and growth of a subpopulation of granulosa cells isolated from mature ovarian follicles and supported them to proliferate into spherical structures exhibiting steroidogenic capacity, as demonstrated by P450-aromatase and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. After transplantation into the ovaries of immunodeficient mice, these cells became localized preferentially within antral follicles and the prolonged expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor was confirmed as well. With this optimization of the culture conditions, an environment was created, which acts as a niche closely mimicking the development of early ovarian follicles in vitro.","['Kossowska-Tomaszczuk, Katarzyna', 'Pelczar, Pawel', 'Guven, Sinan', 'Kowalski, Jacek', 'Volpi, Emanuela', 'De Geyter, Christian', 'Scherberich, Arnaud']","['Kossowska-Tomaszczuk K', 'Pelczar P', 'Guven S', 'Kowalski J', 'Volpi E', 'De Geyter C', 'Scherberich A']","[""Woman's Hospital, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tissue Eng Part A,Tissue engineering.

In the swim bladder anlage, pbx1 was detected as early as 28 hpf, making it the earliest known marker for this organ. Morpholino-mediated gene knockdown of pbx1 revealed that the swim bladder failed to inflate, with eventual lethality occurring by 8 dpf. The knockdown of pbx1 did not perturb the expression of prdc and foxA3, with both early swim bladder markers appearing normally at 36 and 48 hpf, respectively.

PROCEDURE: Between 2000 and 2007, 2,074 ASNase samples from 763 patients out of 114 hospitals were evaluated (5,000 U/m2 E. coli ASNase (n = 318), 1,000 U/m2 pegylated ASNase (n = 416) and 10,000 U/m2 Erwinia chrysanthemi ASNase (n = 29)). RESULTS: First-line therapy with 5,000 U/m2 E. coli ASNase resulted in an ASNase activity of <100 U/L in 10% of all samples from day +3 after administration. Second-line treatment with 1,000 U/m2 PEG ASNase led to activity values below 100 U/L in approximately 30% of all samples taken +7 days. Relating ASNase activity to route of administration, 10,000 U/m2 Erwinia ASNase IM compared to IV as third-line treatment, led to a higher median activity (IM: median 151.5 U/L, range (0-750 U/L); IV: median 115 U/L, range (0-884 U/L), P = 0.3) and fewer samples below 100 U/L (IM: 15% vs. IV: 45%) at day +2. CONCLUSION: The reduced dose of 5,000 U/m2 E. coli ASNase for induction treatment succeeded to achieve an activity level above 100 U/L in more than 90% of all samples.

Treatment duration was 6 weeks for solid tumor xenografts and 3 weeks for ALL xenografts. RESULTS: MLN8237 had a median IC(50) of 61 nM against the PPTP in vitro panel. The ALL cell lines were more sensitive and the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines less sensitive than the remaining PPTP cell lines. In vivo, MLN8237 induced significant differences in event-free survival (EFS) distributions compared to controls in 32/40 (80%) solid tumor models and all (6/6) ALL models. Maintained complete responses (CRs) were observed in 3 of 7 neuroblastoma xenografts, and all 6 evaluable ALL xenografts achieved CR (n = 4) or maintained CR (n = 2) status. Maintained CRs were observed among single xenografts in other panels, including the Wilms tumor, rhabdoid tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and medulloblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo activity observed against the neuroblastoma panel far exceeds that observed for standard agents evaluated against the panel by the PPTP. High levels of in vivo activity were also observed against the ALL xenograft panel. These data support expedited clinical development of MLN8237 in childhood cancer.","['Maris, John M', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Lock, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Houghton, Peter J']","['Maris JM', 'Morton CL', 'Gorlick R', 'Kolb EA', 'Lock R', 'Carol H', 'Keir ST', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Wu J', 'Smith MA', 'Houghton PJ']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4318, USA. maris@chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (MLN 8237)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurka protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Aurora Kinase A', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Azepines/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22430 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):26-34. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22430.,10.1002/pbc.22430 [doi],,,,,"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2874079,,,['NIHMS165147'],,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):3-4.

Preclinical data have indicated that dasatinib is metabolized primarily through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and may cause QT prolongation. In light of its improved tolerability, the authors were interested in the safety of a once-daily dasatinib regimen. METHODS: The authors conducted a phase 1 trial of dasatinib in 29 patients with advanced solid tumors. Segment 1 of the trial was short term and sequential and was designed to determine whether the coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had an effect on the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib. Segment 2 was designed to evaluate the safety of dasatinib as dosing was increased. QT intervals were monitored closely in both segments. Efficacy was assessed in Segment 2 using both positron emission tomography and computed tomography. RESULTS: Hematologic toxicities were markedly less than those observed in patients with leukemia, whereas nonhematologic toxicities were similar. The authors determined that the maximum recommended dose was 180 mg once daily based on the incidence of pleural effusion. Coadministration of ketoconazole led to a marked increase in dasatinib exposure, which was correlated with an increase in corrected QT (QTc) values of approximately 6 msec. No adverse cardiac events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The dose-limiting toxic effect for dasatinib was pleural effusion. The pharmacokinetic and cardiac studies indicated that coadministration of dasatinib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or agents that prolong the QTc interval should be avoided if possible. Close monitoring for toxicity and dose reduction should be considered if the coadministration of such agents cannot be avoided.","['Johnson, Faye M', 'Agrawal, Shruti', 'Burris, Howard', 'Rosen, Lee', 'Dhillon, Navneet', 'Hong, David', 'Blackwood-Chirchir, Anne', 'Luo, Feng R', 'Sy, Oumar', 'Kaul, Sanjeev', 'Chiappori, Alberto A']","['Johnson FM', 'Agrawal S', 'Burris H', 'Rosen L', 'Dhillon N', 'Hong D', 'Blackwood-Chirchir A', 'Luo FR', 'Sy O', 'Kaul S', 'Chiappori AA']","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, Unit 432, The University of Texas M.

We focused on whether antigen-specific CTLs could be damaged by the repeated stimulation of antigenic peptide and whether regulatory T (Treg) cells would be increased by the administration of WT1 peptide. We administered WT1 peptide 22 times over 18 months in a CML patient who was being treated with imatinib. Although WT1 peptide administration every 2 weeks did not show any beneficial effects on the minimal residual disease (copies of bcr-abl transcripts), the transcripts remarkably decreased to the level of major molecular response after changing the administration interval of WT1 peptide from 2 to 4 weeks. An ex vivo study demonstrated that re-stimulation with WT1 peptide made WT1-specific T cells less reactive to WT1 tetramers and the impaired reactivity of CTLs lasted at least for 1 week. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the T cells was hampered by re-stimulation. Treg cells increased up to more than fivefold at the end of the WT1 administration period. The present findings suggested that the administration of the peptide every 4 weeks is superior to every 2 weeks. In addition, the findings that Treg cells increased gradually in accordance with the duration of WT1 peptide administration revealed the significance of manipulating Treg cells for establishing an efficient tumor antigen peptide vaccination.","['Saitoh, Anri', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Watanabe, Norihiro', 'Tochiki, Nozomi', 'Yamahira, Akie', 'Nakamura, Takeshi', 'Kaji, Masami', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Toba, Ken', 'Fuse, Ichiro', 'Aizawa, Yoshifusa', 'Takahashi, Masuhiro']","['Saitoh A', 'Narita M', 'Watanabe N', 'Tochiki N', 'Yamahira A', 'Nakamura T', 'Kaji M', 'Masuko M', 'Furukawa T', 'Toba K', 'Fuse I', 'Aizawa Y', 'Takahashi M']","['Division of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Vaccination', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2010/01/29 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2009/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9425-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Mar;28(1):219-30. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9425-3.

Key prognostic factors for patients with AML are high CD33 expression on the leukaemic cells and the ability to overcome mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies, including drug efflux or other mechanisms decreasing apoptosis. Alpha particle-emitting radionuclides overwhelm such anti-apoptotic mechanisms by producing numerous DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) accompanied by decreased DNA repair. METHODS: We labelled anti-CD33 antibodies with the alpha-emitter (211)At and compared survival of leukaemic HL-60 and K-562 cells treated with the (211)At-labelled antibodies, GO or unlabelled antibodies as controls. We also measured caspase-3/7 activity, DNA fragmentation and necrosis in HL-60 cells after treatment with the different antibodies or with free (211)At. RESULTS: The mean labelling ratio of (211)At-labelled antibodies was 1:1,090 +/- 364 (range: 1:738-1:1,722) in comparison to 2-3:1 for GO. Tumour cell binding of (211)At-anti-CD33 was high in the presence of abundant CD33 expression and could be specifically blocked by unlabelled anti-CD33. (211)At-anti-CD33 decreased survival significantly more than did GO at comparable dilution (1:1,000). No significant differences in induction of apoptosis or necrosis or DNA DSB or in decreased survival were observed after (211)At-anti-CD33 (1:1,090) versus GO (1:1) treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that (211)At is a promising, highly cytotoxic radioimmunotherapy in CD33-positive leukaemia and kills tumour cells more efficiently than does calicheamicin-conjugated antibody. Labelling techniques leading to higher chemical yield and specific activities must be developed to increase (211)At-anti-CD33 therapeutic effects.","['Petrich, Thorsten', 'Korkmaz, Zekiye', 'Krull, Doris', 'Fromke, Cornelia', 'Meyer, Geerd J', 'Knapp, Wolfram H']","['Petrich T', 'Korkmaz Z', 'Krull D', 'Fromke C', 'Meyer GJ', 'Knapp WH']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hanover University School of Medicine, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hanover, Germany.

METHODS: A descriptive study of the disease burden in the years 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2002, by Cuba's most frequently associated cancer types and locations. Official Cuban sources were used to calculate years of potential life lost (YPLL) due to mortality (based on life expectancy) and morbidity (based on the incidence, average duration, and severity of the disease), as well as years of potential life lost per death (YPLL/D) and the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), for each cancer type and location, by sex and age group. RESULTS: The locations with higher YPLL were also those with the greatest total burden: lung, breast, prostate, colon and rectum, and cervix, and showed an upward trend for all cancer types and locations, except leukemia. The morbidity-related YPLL were concentrated in: breast, lung, prostate, colon and rectum, and cervix. In men, the highest mortality-related YPLL values were in the oral cavity and oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, lung, bladder, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia; women were more affected by cancer of the colon and rectum. The highest YPLL/D values were observed for cervix, breast, ovaries, leukemia, and lymphoma. The cancer types and locations with more DALYs were: lung, breast, prostate, colon and rectum, cervix, and endometrium. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease from cancer increased in Cuba from 1990-2002, mostly due to a rise in the mortality burden.","['Alonso, Emma Dominguez', 'Jo, Armando H Seuc', 'Galan, Yaima']","['Alonso ED', 'Jo AH', 'Galan Y']","['Departamento de Metodologia de la Investigacion, Instituto Nacional de Endocrinologia, Ciudad de La Habana, Cuba. inen@infomed.sld.cu']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost of Illness', 'Cuba/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2008/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['S1020-49892009001100005 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2009 Nov;26(5):412-8.,S1020-49892009001100005 [pii],,,,,,,,La carga de enfermedad por cancer en Cuba en el periodo 1990-2002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At relapse, four, two, and one patients were classified as having hematologic, major molecular, and cytogenetic relapse, respectively. At imatinib initiation, five had CML in a chronic phase, while one patient was diagnosed as having accelerated phase and blast crisis. All these patients could be evaluated for the therapeutic efficacy. At a mean of follow-up of 1.9 years of therapy, all evaluable patients achieved major molecular response without compromising safety.

We investigated whether oxidative injury to placental endothelial cells is inhibited by activation of antioxidant enzymes by paracrine factors secreted by human placental multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hPMSC). hPMSC-conditioned medium and umbilical endothelial cells were assayed for cytokines and cytokine receptor expression by immunoassay and real-time PCR. Endothelial cell survival was evaluated by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium, inner salt] assay and caspase 3 activity assay. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide was used to induce oxidative injury in endothelial cells, with fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry used to detect intracellular peroxides and cell apoptosis. Western blot, real-time PCR, STAT3 DNA-binding activity assay, and STAT3 siRNA were used to assess endothelial cell antioxidant enzymes. hPMSC-conditioned medium supported endothelial cell survival and reduced endothelial cell intracellular peroxides and apoptosis. hPMSCs expressed the transcripts of the interleukin (IL) 6 cytokine family, including IL6 and leukemia-inhibitory factor. hPMSC-conditioned medium activated STAT3 expression in endothelial cells, which was inhibited by neutralizing antibody to interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL6ST) but not to IL6 or leukemia-inhibitory factor. STAT3 siRNA or manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) siRNA transfected into endothelial cells inhibited the antiapoptotic effect of conditioned medium. SOD2 was significantly upregulated in endothelial cells by conditioned medium via STAT3 activation that, in turn, was inhibited by IL6ST-neutralizing antibody or STAT3 siRNA. Paracrine factors secreted by hPMSCs support endothelial cell survival. STAT3 activation and SOD2 production protect against oxidative stress-induced endothelial cell damage.","['Liu, Shu-Hsiang', 'Huang, Jian-Pei', 'Lee, Robert Kuo-Kuang', 'Huang, Ming-Chao', 'Wu, Yi-Hsin', 'Chen, Chia-Yu', 'Chen, Chie-Pein']","['Liu SH', 'Huang JP', 'Lee RK', 'Huang MC', 'Wu YH', 'Chen CY', 'Chen CP']","['Department of Medical Research, Division of High Risk Pregnancy, and Division of Infertility and Human Reproduction, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (superoxide dismutase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology', 'Paracrine Communication/physiology', 'Placenta/*cytology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/drug effects/*physiology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/drug effects/*metabolism']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/08/26 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.109.081828 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.109.081828 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2010 May;82(5):905-13. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.109.081828.

This study investigated educational attainment in a large population-based cohort of survivors of all types of childhood cancer in Great Britain. METHODS: Four levels of educational attainment among 10,183 cancer survivors--degree, teaching qualification, advanced (A') levels, and ordinary (O') levels--were compared with expected levels in the general population. A questionnaire was used to obtain educational attainment data for survivors, and comparable information for the general population was available from the General Household Survey. Factors associated with level of educational attainment achieved by cancer survivors were identified using multivariable logistic regression together with likelihood ratio tests. Logistic regression adjusting for age and sex was used for comparisons with the general population. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Childhood cancer survivors had lower educational attainment than the general population (degree: odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, 99% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 0.87; teaching qualification: OR = 0.85, 99% CI = 0.77 to 0.94; A'level: OR = 0.85, 99% CI = 0.78 to 0.93; O'level: OR = 0.81, 99% CI = 0.74 to 0.90; P < .001, all levels). Statistically significant deficits were restricted to central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm and leukemia survivors. For leukemia, only those treated with radiotherapy were considered. Odds ratios for achievement by irradiated CNS tumor survivors were 50%-74% of those for cranially irradiated leukemia or nonirradiated CNS tumor survivors. Survivors at greater risk of poorer educational outcomes included those treated with cranial irradiation, diagnosed with a CNS tumor, older at questionnaire completion, younger at diagnosis, diagnosed with epilepsy, and who were female. CONCLUSIONS: Specific groups of childhood cancer survivors achieve lower-than-expected educational attainment.

It is not known whether this age-related DNA methylation phenomenon is specific to human tissues. We performed comprehensive DNA methylation profiling of promoter regions in aging mouse intestine using methylated CpG island amplification in combination with microarray analysis. By comparing C57BL/6 mice at 3-mo-old versus 35-mo-old for 3627 detectable autosomal genes, we found 774 (21%) that showed increased methylation and 466 (13%) that showed decreased methylation. We used pyrosequencing to quantitatively validate the microarray data and confirmed linear age-related methylation changes for all 12 genomic regions examined. We then examined 11 changed genomic loci for age-related methylation in other tissues. Of these, three of 11 showed similar changes in lung, seven of 11 changed in liver, and six of 11 changed in spleen, though to a lower degree than the changes seen in colon. There was partial conservation between age-related hypermethylation in human and mouse intestines, and Polycomb targets in embryonic stem cells were enriched among the hypermethylated genes. Our findings demonstrate a surprisingly high rate of hyper- and hypomethylation as a function of age in normal mouse small intestine tissues and a strong tissue-specificity to the process. We conclude that epigenetic deregulation is a common feature of aging in mammals.","['Maegawa, Shinji', 'Hinkal, George', 'Kim, Hyun Soo', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhang, Jiexin', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Donehower, Lawrence A', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Maegawa S', 'Hinkal G', 'Kim HS', 'Shen L', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang N', 'Liang S', 'Donehower LA', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,,IM,"['Aging/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Organ Specificity/*genetics']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.096826.109 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.096826.109 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2010 Mar;20(3):332-40. doi: 10.1101/gr.096826.109.

Other alphaherpesviruses also express ICP0-related RING finger proteins, but these have limited homology outside the core RING domain. Existing evidence indicates that ICP0 family members have similar properties, but there has been no systematic comparison of the biochemical activities and biological functions of these proteins. Here, we describe an inducible cell line system that allows expression of the ICP0-related proteins of bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1), equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and their subsequent functional analysis. We report that the RING domains of all the proteins have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. The BHV-1, EHV-1, and PRV proteins complement ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation and induce derepression of quiescent HSV-1 genomes to levels similar to those achieved by ICP0 itself. VICP0, the ICP0 expressed by VZV, was found to be extremely unstable, which limited its analysis in this system. We compared the abilities of the ICP0-related proteins to disrupt ND10, to induce degradation of PML and Sp100, to affect key components of the interferon signaling pathway, and to interfere with induction of interferon-stimulated genes. We found that the property that correlated most closely with their biological activities was the ability to preclude the recruitment of cellular ND10 proteins to sites closely associated with incoming HSV-1 genomes and early replication compartments.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Boutell, Chris', 'McNair, Carol', 'Grant, Louise', 'Orr, Anne']","['Everett RD', 'Boutell C', 'McNair C', 'Grant L', 'Orr A']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, United Kingdom. r.everett@mrcvu.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gene 63 protein, Equine herpesvirus 1)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/*chemistry', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 1, Suid/*chemistry', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02544-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02544-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Apr;84(7):3476-87. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02544-09.

The present study investigates the overall survival (OS), infection-related mortality and changes in treatment of IFIs in our department from 1995 until 2006. METHODS: Outcomes of all chemotherapy courses were retrospectively evaluated using a standard questionnaire. Modified EORTC/MSG criteria for IFIs were applied: a positive PCR result for Aspergillus spp. in bronchoalveolar lavage was also defined as probable IFI. RESULTS: In total, 1693 chemotherapy courses in 592 patients were evaluated. Sixty-three percent of chemotherapy courses were given to treat acute myeloid leukaemia, with the rest for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or aggressive lymphoma. IFIs were observed in 139/592 patients [23.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20%-27%] and in 149/1693 courses (8.8%, 95% CI 8%-10%). IFI-related mortality was 56.9% in 1995-2001 and 28.6% in 2002-06, P < 0.001. Accordingly, median OS in patients with IFI increased: 54 days (95% CI 26-82 days) in 1995-2001 versus 229 days (95% CI 35-423 days) in 2002-06, P = 0.001. By multivariate analysis, factors predictive for better OS were controlled disease after chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.228, P < 0.001], possible IFI (in contrast to proven/probable IFI, HR 0.537, P = 0.005), age <60 years (HR 0.583, P = 0.008), time period 2002-06 (HR 0.612, P = 0.021) and use of novel antifungals (HR 0.589, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 1995-2001, IFI-related mortality decreased and OS in patients with IFI increased significantly in recent years. Improved OS was associated with controlled haematological disease, certainty of IFI diagnosis (possible), younger age, time period 2002-06 and the use of novel antifungals.","['Hahn-Ast, Corinna', 'Glasmacher, Axel', 'Muckter, Sara', 'Schmitz, Andrea', 'Kraemer, Anja', 'Marklein, Gunter', 'Brossart, Peter', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie']","['Hahn-Ast C', 'Glasmacher A', 'Muckter S', 'Schmitz A', 'Kraemer A', 'Marklein G', 'Brossart P', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, Bonn, Germany. corinna.hahn-ast@ukb.uni-bonn.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['dkp507 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkp507 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Apr;65(4):761-8. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkp507.

We show that while differential up regulation of the modulators (GILZ, GR and IkappaBalpha) was demonstrated in GC-sensitive compared to GC-resistant sub-lines, this was not coupled with altered nuclear translocation or functionality of the RelA, p50 or c-Rel subunits of NFkappaB. Thus, GC-resistance in the PreB 697 cell line model is not mediated by NFkappaB, however further investigation of the impact of these GC-sensitive associated proteins on other survival pathways, such as the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, is warranted.","['Nicholson, Lindsay', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Redfern, Christopher P', 'Irving, Julie']","['Nicholson L', 'Hall AG', 'Redfern CP', 'Irving J']","[""Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Paul O'Gorman Building, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear NE2 4HH, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (TSC22D3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/physiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00596-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.12.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Oct;34(10):1366-73. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.12.014.

In the immunocompromised patient, cryptosporidium may cause severe illness with prolonged diarrhea and malabsorption. Pharmacologic therapy of cryptosporidium relies on adequate delivery of drug metabolites to the colon. Here we describe a patient who developed toxic megacolon during induction therapy for leukemia, requiring ileostomy formation to proceed with leukemia treatment. Although the megacolon resolved promptly, the resulting isolation of the colon from the fecal stream prevented luminal delivery of active metabolites of anti-protozoal drugs, resulting in persistent cryptosporidiosis. Refeeding of the ileostomy output into the colon effectively eradicated cryptosporidium from the colon and permitted closure of the ileostomy.","['Sidebotham, Emma L', 'Sepkowitz, Kent', 'Price, Anita P', 'Steinherz, Peter G', 'La Quaglia, Michael P', 'Kayton, Mark L']","['Sidebotham EL', 'Sepkowitz K', 'Price AP', 'Steinherz PG', 'La Quaglia MP', 'Kayton ML']","['Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antiprotozoal Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antiprotozoal Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Catheterization', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colon/*parasitology', 'Colonic Diseases/*drug therapy/parasitology', 'Cryptosporidiosis/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Cryptosporidium/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Diarrhea/drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileostomy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Megacolon/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trichuris/isolation & purification']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2009/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3468(09)00921-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.10.091 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2010 Jan;45(1):E33-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.10.091.,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.10.091 [doi],,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It has recently emerged that nelfinavir could represent a prospective new anti-cancer drug, prompting us to test the effect of nelfinavir on leukemia cells. METHODS: By combining in vitro and ex vivo studies, the effect of nelfinavir on leukemia cells and non-malignant, bone marrow-derived tissue cells was analyzed. RESULTS: At a concentration of 9 microg/ml, nelfinavir induced death of 90% of HL60, IM9, and Jurkat cells. At the same concentration and treatment conditions, less than 10% of aspirated human bone marrow cells showed nelfinavir-induced cell damage. Nelfinavir-induced death of leukemia cells was accompanied by activation of caspases 3, 7, and 8. Despite caspase activation, the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family member protein mcl-1 that resulted from nelfinavir treatment stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in primarily mitochondria-independent cell death. Pharmacological downregulation of mcl-1 expression by treatment with sorafenib (2 microg/ml) significantly enhanced nelfinavir-induced apoptosis even at lower nelfinavir concentrations (5 microg/ml), but did not have additional detrimental effects on non-malignant bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of nelfinavir to induce apoptosis in leukemia cells as a single agent in a mitochondria-independent manner might suggest it could be used as a second or third line of treatment for leukemia patients for whom standard mitochondria-directed treatment strategies have failed. Combination treatment with nelfinavir and sorafenib might further enhance the efficacy of nelfinavir even on chemo-resistant leukemia cells.","['Bruning, Ansgar', 'Rahmeh, Martina', 'Gingelmaier, Andrea', 'Friese, Klaus']","['Bruning A', 'Rahmeh M', 'Gingelmaier A', 'Friese K']","['Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Department of Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Molecular Biology Laboratory, Munich, Germany. ansgar.bruening@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'HO3OGH5D7I (Nelfinavir)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nelfinavir/*pharmacology', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2009/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-19 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jan 27;9:19. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-19.,10.1186/1476-4598-9-19 [doi],20100127,,,,,PMC2836985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physiological expression of the human channel is restricted to the brain but it is frequently and abundantly expressed in many solid tumors, thereby making it a promising target for a specific diagnosis and therapy. Because chronic lymphatic leukemia has been described not to express hEag1, it has been assumed that the channel is not expressed in hematopoietic neoplasms in general. RESULTS: Here we show that this assumption is not correct, because the channel is up-regulated in myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myeloid leukemia and almost half of the tested acute myeloid leukemias in a subtype-dependent fashion. Most interestingly, channel expression strongly correlated with increasing age, higher relapse rates and a significantly shorter overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed hEag1 expression levels in AML as an independent predictive factor for reduced disease-free and overall survival; such an association had not been reported before. As a functional correlate, specific hEag1 blockade inhibited the proliferation and migration of several AML cell lines and primary cultured AML cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our observations implicate hEag1 as novel target for diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic approaches in AML.","['Agarwal, Jasmin R', 'Griesinger, Frank', 'Stuhmer, Walter', 'Pardo, Luis A']","['Agarwal JR', 'Griesinger F', 'Stuhmer W', 'Pardo LA']","['Max-Planck-Institute of Experimental Medicine, Hermann-Rein-Str, 3, 37075 Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/29 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/01/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-18 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jan 27;9:18. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-18.,10.1186/1476-4598-9-18 [doi],20100127,,,,,PMC2835655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only three of the 19 subjects averaged less MVPA than the recommended amount (at least 60 min/day). MVPA levels were significantly higher on weekdays than weekend days (P= 0.006). Overall, boys engaged in significantly more MVPA than girls (P= 0.029). MVPA time was negatively correlated with age (r =-0.80) and age at diagnosis (r =-0.87).

Febrile neutropenic attacks without complications are successfully treated with wide-spectrum anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins or carbapenems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of imipenem in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in children with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients who had a febrile neutropenic (FN) episodes followed by initiation of empirical imipenem therapy were included in the study. RESULTS: Of the patients, 10 (41.7%) had solid tumors, while 14 (58.3%) were diagnosed to have acute leukemia. Among all, 5 (20.8 %) and 15 (62.5 %) of the infections were identified microbiologically and clinically, respectively. Fever of unknown origin was observed in 4 (16.7 %) patients. The mean duration of neutropenia was 6.3 -/+ 1.4 (4-8) days in patients with solid tumors, and 9.3 -/+ 7.4 (3-25) days in the group with leukemia. Average time of stay in hospital was 9.0 -/+ 4.1 (4-20) days for patients with solid tumors, and 14.4 -/+ 10.6 (4-33) days for patients with leukemia. FN duration was observed to be significantly longer in patients with an ANC of less than 200/mm3, and in children who were not in remission for the underlying malignant disease. In addition, average time of stay in hospital was observed to be significantly longer in patients who were not in remission for the underlying malign disease. All of the patients were discharged. The success rate of empirical therapy started with imipenem was found be 95.8 %.

Median time to recovery of platelets 50 x 10(9)/L and neutrophils 0.5 x 10(9)/L after GO was 14 days and 20 days. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild overall, but there was 1 toxic death caused by liver failure. There were no significant differences between both treatment groups with regard to relapse probabilities, nonrelapse mortality, overall survival, or disease-free survival (17% vs 16% at 5 years). Postremission treatment with GO in older AML patients does not provide benefits regarding any clinical end points.

PTLD is efficiently prevented by adoptive transfer of EBV-specific T cells from the donor. To make EBV-specific T cells available in urgent clinical situations, we developed a rapid protocol for their isolation by overnight stimulation of donor blood cells with peptides derived from 11 EBV antigens, interferon-gamma surface capture, and immunomagnetic separation. Six patients with PTLD received 1 transfusion of EBV-specific T cells. No response was seen in 3 patients who had late-stage disease with multiorgan dysfunction at the time of T-cell transfer. In 3 patients who received T cells at an earlier stage of disease, we observed complete and stable remission of PTLD. Two patients have remained free from EBV-associated disease for more than 2 years. CD8(+) T cells specific for EBV early antigens rapidly expanded after T-cell transfer, temporarily constituted greater than 20% of all peripheral blood lymphocytes, and were maintained throughout the observation period.

Genome sequencing, high-throughput screening, and proteomics have, however, generated large datasets, revealing a high level of complexity in components and interactions. Systems biology embraces this complexity with a combination of mathematical, engineering, and computational tools for constructing and validating models of biologic phenomena. The validity of mathematical modeling in hematopoiesis was established early by the pioneering work of Till and McCulloch. In reviewing more recent papers, we highlight deterministic, stochastic, statistical, and network-based models that have been used to better understand a range of topics in hematopoiesis, including blood cell production, the periodicity of cyclical neutropenia, stem cell production in response to cytokine administration, and the emergence of imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia. Future advances require technologic improvements in computing power, imaging, and proteomics as well as greater collaboration between experimentalists and modelers. Altogether, systems biology will improve our understanding of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis, better define stem cells and their daughter cells, and potentially lead to more effective therapies.","['Whichard, Zakary L', 'Sarkar, Casim A', 'Kimmel, Marek', 'Corey, Seth J']","['Whichard ZL', 'Sarkar CA', 'Kimmel M', 'Corey SJ']","[""Departments of Pediatrics and Cell and Molecular Biology, Children's Memorial Hospital and the Robert H.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of HCC. However, the effect of viral proteins in mediating chemosensitivity in tumor cells is unknown. We postulated that HCV viral proteins could modulate therapeutic responses by altering host cell microRNA (miRNA) expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HepG2 malignant hepatocytes were stably transfected with full-length HCV genome (Hep-394) or an empty vector (Hep-SWX). MiRNA profiling was done by using a custom microarray, and the expression of selected miRNAs was validated by real-time PCR. Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting, whereas caspase activation was assessed by a luminometric assay. RESULTS: The IC(50) to sorafenib was lower in Hep-394 compared with Hep-SWX control cells. Alterations in miRNA expression occurred with 10 miRNAs downregulated >2-fold and 23 miRNAs upregulated >2-fold in Hep-394 cells compared with controls. Of these, miR-193b was overexpressed by 5-fold in Hep-394 cells. miR-193b was predicted to target Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein that can modulate the response to sorafenib. The expression of Mcl-1 was decreased, and basal caspase-3/7 activity and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage were increased in Hep-394 cells compared with controls. Moreover, transfection with precursors to miR-193b decreased both Mcl-1 expression and the IC(50) to sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular expression of full-length HCV increases sensitivity to sorafenib by the miRNA-dependent modulation of Mcl-1 and apoptosis. Modulation of miRNA responses may be a useful strategy to enhance response to chemotherapy in HCC.","['Braconi, Chiara', 'Valeri, Nicola', 'Gasparini, Pierluigi', 'Huang, Nianyuan', 'Taccioli, Cristian', 'Nuovo, Gerard', 'Suzuki, Tetsuro', 'Croce, Carlo Maria', 'Patel, Tushar']","['Braconi C', 'Valeri N', 'Gasparini P', 'Huang N', 'Taccioli C', 'Nuovo G', 'Suzuki T', 'Croce CM', 'Patel T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzenesulfonates/*therapeutic use', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*virology', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/*pharmacology']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-2123 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2123 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Feb 1;16(3):957-66. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2123.

Emerging evidence from genetically modified animal models, however, suggests that elevated levels of VEGF, or a proangiogenic phenotype, may impede, rather than promote, early tumor development and progression. For example, hypermorph VEGF transgenic mice display delayed progression of a retroviral-induced murine leukemia, and knockdown of VEGF expression within the myeloid compartment accelerates tumor progression. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this paradox, whereby VEGF induces changes within the hematopoietic compartment and tumor microenvironment through recruitment of tumor inhibitory monocytic cells and the negative regulation of tumor angiogenesis. Thus, it is apparent that the levels of VEGF expression in both tumor and nontumor tissues, as well as the context and timing of its modulation relative to cancer induction, play an important role in determining the effects of VEGF expression on tumorigenicity. In light of these recent findings, the various mechanisms underlying the negative role of VEGF during early tumor development, progression, and metastasis will be discussed.","['Vecchiarelli-Federico, Laura M', 'Cervi, David', 'Haeri, Mehran', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Nagy, Andras', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Vecchiarelli-Federico LM', 'Cervi D', 'Haeri M', 'Li Y', 'Nagy A', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-3592 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3592 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Feb 1;70(3):863-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3592.

In response to stress, cancer cells have been reported to accumulate the protein p62/SQSTM1 (p62), but its role in the regulation of autophagy is controversial. Here, we report that the plant phytoalexin resveratrol (RSV) triggers autophagy in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells via JNK-dependent accumulation of p62. JNK inhibition or p62 knockdown prevented RSV-mediated autophagy and antileukemic effects. RSV also stimulated AMPK, thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. AMPK knockdown or mTOR overexpression impaired RSV-induced autophagy but not JNK activation. Lastly, p62 expression and autophagy in CD34+ progenitors from patients with CML was induced by RSV, and disrupting autophagy protected CD34+ CML cells from RSV-mediated cell death. We concluded that RSV triggered autophagic cell death in CML cells via both JNK-mediated p62 overexpression and AMPK activation. Our findings show that the JNK and AMPK pathways can cooperate to eliminate CML cells via autophagy.","['Puissant, Alexandre', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Fenouille, Nina', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Cassuto, Jill-Patrice', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Puissant A', 'Robert G', 'Fenouille N', 'Luciano F', 'Cassuto JP', 'Raynaud S', 'Auberger P']","[""INSERM 895, Team 2: Cell Death Differentiation and Cancer, Laboratoire d'Oncohematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice, Nice, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SQSTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '88899-55-2 (bafilomycin A1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (PRKAA1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Resveratrol', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-3537 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3537 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Feb 1;70(3):1042-52. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3537.

Patients who achieved durable remissions after DLI developed a significant B-cell lymphocytosis after treatment, which did not occur in patients who were unresponsive to DLI. In this study, we identified antigen targets of this B-cell response by probing two immunoproteomic platforms with plasma immunoglobulins from seven CML patients with clinically apparent graft-versus-leukemia responses after DLI. In total, 62 antigens elicited greater reactivity from post-DLI versus pre-DLI plasma. Microarray analysis revealed that >70% of the antigens were expressed in CML CD34(+) cells, suggesting that expression in malignant progenitor cells is a feature common to antibody targets of DLI. We confirmed elevated expression of three target antigens (RAB38, TBCE, and DUSP12) in CML that together consistently elicited antibody responses in 18 of 21 of an additional cohort of CML patients with therapeutic responses, but not in normal donors and rarely in non-CML patients. In summary, immunologic targets of curative DLI responses include multiple antigens on CML progenitor cells, identifying them as potential immunogens for vaccination and/or monitoring of immunotherapeutics designed to eliminate myeloid leukemia stem cells.","['Biernacki, Melinda A', 'Marina, Ovidiu', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Liu, Fenglong', 'Bruns, Ingmar', 'Cai, Ann', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Canning, Christine M', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Brusic, Vladimir', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Biernacki MA', 'Marina O', 'Zhang W', 'Liu F', 'Bruns I', 'Cai A', 'Neuberg D', 'Canning CM', 'Alyea EP', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Brusic V', 'Ritz J', 'Wu CJ']","['Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TBCE protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (dual specificity phosphatase 12)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RAB38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Library', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral/immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2303 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2303 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Feb 1;70(3):906-15. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2303.

Here, we report the identification of escin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid from horse chestnut that exhibits antitumor potential against leukemia and multiple myeloma. Whether examined by esterase staining, phosphatidyl-serine staining, DNA breakage, or caspase-mediated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, escin potentiated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis but inhibited tumor cell invasion. This correlated with the down-regulation of bcl-2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2, cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which are all regulated by the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. When examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the triterpenoid suppressed nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation induced by TNF and other inflammatory agents, and this correlated with the inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, inhibition of IkappaB kinase complex (IKK) activation, suppression of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and abrogation of NF-kappaB-dependent reporter activity. Overall, our results demonstrate that escin inhibits activation of NF-kappaB through inhibition of IKK, leading to down-regulation of NF-kappaB-regulated cell survival and metastatic gene products and thus resulting in sensitization of cells to cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents.","['Harikumar, Kuzhuvelil B', 'Sung, Bokyung', 'Pandey, Manoj K', 'Guha, Sushovan', 'Krishnan, Sunil', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Harikumar KB', 'Sung B', 'Pandey MK', 'Guha S', 'Krishnan S', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '6805-41-0 (Escin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Escin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/embryology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mutagenesis', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.109.062760 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.109.062760 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 May;77(5):818-27. doi: 10.1124/mol.109.062760.

However, an incompatibility exists between GaLV Env and lentiviral vectors that results in decreased steady-state levels of the mature GaLV Env in cells and prevents its incorporation into lentiviral vector particles. RESULTS: We identified the HIV-1 Vpu protein as the major cause of the depletion in GaLV Env levels that occurs when lentiviral vector components are present. This activity of Vpu targeted the mature (cleaved) form of the GaLV Env that exists within or beyond the trans-Golgi. The activity required two conserved phospho-serines in the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu that are known to recruit beta TrCP, a substrate adaptor for an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and could be blocked by mutation of lysine 618 in the GaLV Env tail. Moreover, the Vpu-mediated decrease of GaLV Env levels was inhibited by the lysosomal inhibitor, bafilomycin A1. Interestingly, this activity of Vpu was only observed in the presence of other lentiviral vector components. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to the mechanism whereby Vpu targets BST-2/tetherin for degradation, these findings implicate beta-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and the endo-lysosomal pathway in the degradation of the GaLV Env by lentiviral vector components. Possibly, the cytoplasmic tail of the GaLV Env contains features that mimic bona fide targets of Vpu, important to HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the lack of effect of Vpu on GaLV Env in the absence of other HIV-1 proteins, suggests that a more complex interaction may exist between Vpu and its target proteins, with the additional involvement of one or more component(s) of the HIV-1 replication machinery.","['Christodoulopoulos, Ilias', 'Droniou-Bonzom, Magali E', 'Oldenburg, Jill E', 'Cannon, Paula M']","['Christodoulopoulos I', 'Droniou-Bonzom ME', 'Oldenburg JE', 'Cannon PM']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins)', '0 (vpu protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins/metabolism']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2009/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-4 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Jan 26;7:4. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-4.,10.1186/1742-4690-7-4 [doi],20100126,,,,"['P01 CA 59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI068546/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2831008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine Graffi leukaemia retrovirus induces erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias when inoculated into NFS mice and represents a good model to study these leukaemias. METHODS: To expand our understanding of genes specific to these leukaemias, we compared gene expression profiles, measured by microarray and RT-PCR, of all leukaemia types induced by this virus. RESULTS: The transcriptome level changes, present between the different leukaemias, led to the identification of specific cancerous signatures. We reported numerous genes that may be potential oncogenes, may have a function related to erythropoiesis or megakaryopoiesis or have a poorly elucidated physiological role. The expression pattern of these genes has been further tested by RT-PCR in different samples, in a Friend erythroleukaemic model and in human leukaemic cell lines.We also screened the megakaryoblastic leukaemias for viral integrations and identified genes targeted by these integrations and potentially implicated in the onset of the disease.

METHODS: Lactadherin, a milk protein with stereospecific binding to phosphatidyl-L-serine, was used as a probe for PS exposure on an immortalized APL cell line (NB4) and on the cells of eight patients with APL. PS exposure was evaluated with flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, coagulation assays, and purified prothrombinase and factor (F) Xase assays. RESULTS: Plasma procoagulant activity of NB4 and APL cells increased approximately 15-fold after exposure to etoposide or daunorubicin and decreased 80% after treatment with ATRA or As(2)O(3). Procoagulant activity corresponded to exposed PS on viable APL cells. PS exposure decreased after treatment with ATRA or As(2)O(3) and increased after treatment with daunorubicin or etoposide. Excess lactadherin inhibited 80-85% of intrinsic FXase, FVIIa-tissue factor and prothrombinase activities on both NB4 cells and APL cells. Confocal microscopy identified membrane patches that stained with lactadherin, but not annexin V, demonstrating focal, low-level PS exposure. CONCLUSIONS: PS is exposed on viable APL cells and is necessary for approximately 80% of procoagulant activity.","['Zhou, J', 'Shi, J', 'Hou, J', 'Cao, F', 'Zhang, Y', 'Rasmussen, J T', 'Heegaard, C W', 'Gilbert, G E']","['Zhou J', 'Shi J', 'Hou J', 'Cao F', 'Zhang Y', 'Rasmussen JT', 'Heegaard CW', 'Gilbert GE']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China. jinzhouh85@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PAS-6-7 glycoprotein, Bos taurus)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', '*Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Factor Xa/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JTH3763 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.03763.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2010 Apr;8(4):773-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.03763.x.

Five compounds with guanine, three with hypoxanthine, and five with 9-deazaguanine, all connected by a linker with difluoromethylene phosphonic acid, were studied on their inhibitory potential against human and calf PNPs. Antiproliferative activity of these analogues against lymphocytes as well as lymphoma and leukaemia cells has been also investigated. All tested compounds act as multisubstrate analogue inhibitors of PNP with the apparent inhibition constants in the range 5-100 nm, and also show a slight antiproliferative activity. Analogues with 9-deazaguanine aglycone have better anti-leukaemic and anti-lymphoma activities compared to the guanine and hypoxanthine analogues, and applied in the concentration of 100 mum, caused a statistically significant decrease in the cell viability in all human leukaemia and lymphoma cells used. Despite the high PNP inhibitory potential of tested analogues, no differences were observed between the effects on the growth of tumour cells sensible to the inhibition of PNP, such as human adult T-cell leukaemia and lymphoma cells, and other investigated cells. Obtained poor effects on cell proliferation could be explained probably by a poor ability of tested compounds to penetrate cell membranes.","['Glavas-Obrovac, Ljubica', 'Suver, Mirjana', 'Hikishima, Sadao', 'Hashimoto, Mariko', 'Yokomatsu, Tsutomu', 'Magnowska, Lucyna', 'Bzowska, Agnieszka']","['Glavas-Obrovac L', 'Suver M', 'Hikishima S', 'Hashimoto M', 'Yokomatsu T', 'Magnowska L', 'Bzowska A']","['School of Medicine, J.J.

Several viruses encode proteins containing bZIP domains, including four that encode bZIPs lacking significant homology to any human protein. We investigated the interaction specificity of these four viral bZIPs by using coiled-coil arrays to assess self-associations as well as heterointeractions with 33 representative human bZIPs. The arrays recapitulated reported viral-human interactions and also uncovered new associations. MEQ and HBZ interacted with multiple human partners and had unique interaction profiles compared to any human bZIPs, whereas K-bZIP and BZLF1 displayed homospecificity. New interactions detected included HBZ with MAFB, MAFG, ATF2, CEBPG, and CREBZF and MEQ with NFIL3. These were confirmed in solution using circular dichroism. HBZ can heteroassociate with MAFB and MAFG in the presence of MARE-site DNA, and this interaction is dependent on the basic region of HBZ. NFIL3 and MEQ have different yet overlapping DNA-binding specificities and can form a heterocomplex with DNA. Computational design considering both affinity for MEQ and specificity with respect to other undesired bZIP-type interactions was used to generate a MEQ dimerization inhibitor. This peptide, anti-MEQ, bound MEQ both stably and specifically, as assayed using coiled-coil arrays and circular dichroism in solution. Anti-MEQ also inhibited MEQ binding to DNA. These studies can guide further investigation of the function of viral and human bZIP complexes.","['Reinke, Aaron W', 'Grigoryan, Gevorg', 'Keating, Amy E']","['Reinke AW', 'Grigoryan G', 'Keating AE']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (ALYREF protein, human)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (BZLF1 protein, Herpesvirus 4, Human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Eco-Q protein, Gallid herpesvirus 2)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (K8 protein, Human herpesvirus 8)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi902065k [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2010 Mar 9;49(9):1985-97. doi: 10.1021/bi902065k.,10.1021/bi902065k [doi],,,,,"['R01 GM067681/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067681-06A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM067681/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2841013,,,['NIHMS175428'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The ethyl acetate fraction from ethanolic extracts of adlay testa (ATE-EtOAc) exhibited potent inhibitory activity that suppressed degranulation from RBL-2H3 cells stimulated by 1 microM A23187. The 20%-80% EtOAc/Hex subfractions of ATE-EtOAc significantly inhibited histamine release with a IC(50) of 75-100 microg/mL. In addition, the ATE-EtOAc subfractions suppressed interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in RBL-2H3 cells, indicating that adlay testa were able to inhibit cytokine secretion. In order to explore the inhibitory mechanism of adlay testa in mast cell degranulation, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules. Adlay testa inhibited the phosphorylation ERK expression. Furthermore, the two major active compounds, 4-hydroxyacetophenone and p-coumaric acid, were isolated from the ATE-EtOAc subfractions. These results suggest that ATE had an inhibitory effect on allergic response via the ERK signaling transduction in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Chen, Hong-Jhang', 'Shih, Chun-Kuang', 'Hsu, Hsin-Yi', 'Chiang, Wenchang']","['Chen HJ', 'Shih CK', 'Hsu HY', 'Chiang W']","['Graduate Institute of Food Science and Technology, College of Bioresources and Agriculture, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Propionates)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'G1L3HT4CMH (4-hydroxyacetophenone)', 'IBS9D1EU3J (p-coumaric acid)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/immunology', '*Coix', 'Coumaric Acids/pharmacology', 'Ethanol', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Hypersensitivity/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Propionates', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/drug effects/metabolism']",2010/01/28 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00,['2010/01/28 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf904356q [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2010 Feb 24;58(4):2596-601. doi: 10.1021/jf904356q.,10.1021/jf904356q [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effects of olive oil phenolic extract and individual compounds on MMP-9 in THP-1 cells, a human monocyte-like cell line. Olive oil extract prevented the stimulation of MMP-9 expression and secretion in tumor necrosis factor alpha-treated THP-1 cells. Oleuropein aglycone, a typical olive oil phenol, was active at concentrations found in the extract, although other compounds probably contribute to the biological activity.

Most of the patients with Sotos syndrome have NSD1 gene deletions or mutations; however, the molecular basis of most of the Weaver syndrome patients is unknown. Patients with overgrowth syndromes have an increased frequency of tumors; the risk in Sotos syndrome patients has been estimated to be about 2-3%, with leukemia and lymphoma accounting for 44% of the malignancies.

While searching the literature for all reported cases with Weaver syndrome and counting the cases with malignancy, we found that the frequency of tumors or hematologic malignancy was 10.9%.

High birth weight was associated with all cancers also when adjusted by gestational age, length at birth, and gender (odds ratio, 6.10 and 95% CI, 1.15-32.57). No associations were found for maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, maternal smoking, or smoking by other people at home or presence of obstetric variables (e.g., gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and abruptio placentae). The present study supports the hypothesis that high birth weight is an independent risk factor for childhood Wilms tumor, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Further studies should explore biological reasons to explain this relationship and, ultimately, to expand our knowledge about prenatal influences on the occurrence of this disease.","['Rangel, Marina', 'Cypriano, Monica', 'de Martino Lee, Maria Lucia', 'Luisi, Flavio Augusto Vercillo', 'Petrilli, Antonio Sergio', 'Strufaldi, Maria Wany Louzada', 'Franco, Maria do Carmo Pinho']","['Rangel M', 'Cypriano M', 'de Martino Lee ML', 'Luisi FA', 'Petrilli AS', 'Strufaldi MW', 'Franco Mdo C']","['Division of Nephrology, School of Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Rua Botucatu, 740, 04023-900, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Birth Weight', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Wilms Tumor/*epidemiology']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/09/04 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2009/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-010-1139-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2010 Jul;169(7):875-81. doi: 10.1007/s00431-010-1139-1.

The virally encoded oncoprotein Tax activates the transcription of HTLV-1 and cellular genes by cooperating with cellular transcription factors. Cyclin D1 is a pivotal regulator of cell cycle progression, and increased expression strongly correlates with malignant transformation. Here, we characterize the mechanism of Tax transactivation of cyclin D1. We find that cyclin D1 transcript levels are elevated in HTLV-1 infected cells and that Tax physically associates with the cyclin D1 gene in vivo. Tax binds the cyclin D1 promoter-proximal cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the presence of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in vitro, and together the Tax-pCREB complex recruits the cellular co-activator p300 to the promoter through this unconventional Tax-responsive element. We further show that the transducer of regulated CREB 2 (TORC2) cooperates with Tax to further enhance p300 recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter in vitro. Tax and TORC2 in combination stimulate cyclin D1 expression in vivo, demonstrating the functional outcome of the binding interactions. Together, our findings support a model in which Tax-induced accumulation of cyclin D1 shortens the G1 phase of the cell cycle, promotes mitotic replication of the virus, and drives selection and expansion of malignant T-cells.","['Kim, Y-M', 'Geiger, T R', 'Egan, D I', 'Sharma, N', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Kim YM', 'Geiger TR', 'Egan DI', 'Sharma N', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CRTC2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclic AMP/genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/05/06 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009498 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.498 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Apr 8;29(14):2142-52. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.498.

Limited knowledge is yet available on the molecular processes resulting in chromosomal rearrangements in tumors. The t(9;22)(q34;q11) rearrangement causing the 5'BCR/3'ABL gene formation has been detected in more than 90% of cases with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In 10-18% of patients with CML, genomic deletions were detected on der(9) chromosome next to translocation breakpoints. The molecular mechanism triggering the t(9;22) and deletions on der(9) is still speculative. Here we report a molecular cytogenetic analysis of a large series of patients with CML with der(9) deletions, revealing an evident breakpoint clustering in two regions located proximally to ABL and distally to BCR, containing an interchromosomal duplication block (SD_9/22). The deletions breakpoints distribution appeared to be strictly related to the distance from the SD_9/22. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses of the regions surrounding the SD_9/22 revealed a high Alu frequency and a poor gene density, reflecting genomic instability and susceptibility to rearrangements. On the basis of our results, we propose a three-step model for t(9;22) formation consisting of alignment of chromosomes 9 and 22 mediated by SD_9/22, spontaneous chromosome breakages and misjoining of DNA broken ends.","['Albano, F', 'Anelli, L', 'Zagaria, A', 'Coccaro, N', ""D'Addabbo, P"", 'Liso, V', 'Rocchi, M', 'Specchia, G']","['Albano F', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Coccaro N', ""D'Addabbo P"", 'Liso V', 'Rocchi M', 'Specchia G']","['Department of Hematology, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. f.albano@ematba.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Computational Biology', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009524 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.524 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Apr 29;29(17):2509-16. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.524.

We also examined the maternal genotypes of 752 of these cases. Data from 824 noncancer controls recruited were used for comparison. No evidence of an association with MTHFR 677 was observed for ALL or AML, either in children or their mothers. However, in children an increased risk of ALL (odds ratio [OR] = 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.07; P = .010) and AML (OR = 2.74; 95% CI, 1.07-7.01; P = .036) was observed with the MTR 2756 GG genotype; the association was most pronounced for cases with the MLL translocation (OR = 4.90; 95% CI, 1.30-18.45; P = .019).

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphoma recognition by gammadelta T cells remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of UL16-binding protein 1 (ULBP1) determine lymphoma susceptibility to gammadelta T cell-mediated cytolysis. Consistent with this, blockade of NKG2D, the receptor for ULBP1 expressed on all Vgamma9(+) T cells, significantly inhibits lymphoma cell killing. Specific loss-of-function studies demonstrate that the role of ULBP1 is nonredundant, highlighting a thus far unique physiologic relevance for tumor recognition by gammadelta T cells. Importantly, we observed a very wide spectrum of ULBP1 expression levels in primary biopsies obtained from lymphoma and leukemia patients. We suggest this will impact on the responsiveness to gammadelta T cell-based immunotherapy, and therefore propose ULBP1 to be used as a leukemia/lymphoma biomarker in upcoming clinical trials.","['Lanca, Telma', 'Correia, Daniel V', 'Moita, Catarina F', 'Raquel, Helena', 'Neves-Costa, Ana', 'Ferreira, Cristina', 'Ramalho, Jose S', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Moita, Luis F', 'Gomes, Anita Q', 'Silva-Santos, Bruno']","['Lanca T', 'Correia DV', 'Moita CF', 'Raquel H', 'Neves-Costa A', 'Ferreira C', 'Ramalho JS', 'Barata JT', 'Moita LF', 'Gomes AQ', 'Silva-Santos B']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (ULBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56591-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-237123 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 25;115(12):2407-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-237123.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects and putative mechanism of action of evasin-1, a novel CCL3-binding protein, in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD was induced by the transplantation of splenocytes from C57BL/6J to B6D2F1 mice. Treatment of recipient mice with evasin-1 prevented mortality associated with GVHD. This was correlated with reduced weight loss and clinical disease severity. Analysis of the small intestine showed that evasin-1 treatment reduced the histopathological score and decreased levels of IFN-gamma and CCL5. Mechanistically, evasin-1 treatment reduced the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the small intestine, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, and the adhesion of leukocytes to intestinal venules of recipient mice, as assessed by intravital microscopy. Evasin-1 was also able to decrease liver damage, as seen by reduction of inflammatory infiltrate and IFN-gamma levels. Treatment with evasin-1 did not interfere with graft-versus-leukemia. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that CCL3 plays a major role in mediating GVHD, but not graft-versus-leukemia in mice and suggest that blockade of CCL3 with evasin-1 has potential therapeutic application in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","['Castor, Marina G M', 'Rezende, Barbara', 'Resende, Carolina B', 'Alessandri, Ana L', 'Fagundes, Caio T', 'Sousa, Lirlandia P', 'Arantes, Rosa M E', 'Souza, Danielle G', 'Silva, Tarcilia A', 'Proudfoot, Amanda E I', 'Teixeira, Mauro M', 'Pinho, Vanessa']","['Castor MG', 'Rezende B', 'Resende CB', 'Alessandri AL', 'Fagundes CT', 'Sousa LP', 'Arantes RM', 'Souza DG', 'Silva TA', 'Proudfoot AE', 'Teixeira MM', 'Pinho V']","['Laboratorio de Imunofarmacologia, Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, BeloHorizonte, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Ccl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccl5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Evasin-1, Rhipicephalus sanguineus)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Chemokine CCL3/*deficiency/genetics', 'Chemokine CCL5/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0902614 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0902614 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Mar 1;184(5):2646-54. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0902614.

Since its discovery, PML has been found to play diverse roles in different cellular processes. Notably, PML has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity that supports its role as a tumor suppressor. We have previously shown that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is able to affect cell proliferation and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-mediated cell death through modulation of the steady-state levels of PML. We have extended these studies to show that the interaction between PML and Pin1 is targeted by multiple extracellular signals in the cell. We show that H(2)O(2) up-regulates and IGF-1 down-regulates PML expression in a Pin1-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that H(2)O(2)- and IGF-1-mediated alteration in PML accumulation regulate MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Furthermore, we show that the control of cell migration by PML, and thus H(2)O(2) and IGF-1, results from PML-dependent decreased expression of integrin beta1 (ITGB1). Knockdown of Pin1 leads to decreased cell migration, lower levels of ITGB1 expression and resistance to IGF-1- and H(2)O(2)-induced changes in cell migration and ITGB1 expression. Taken together, our work identifies PML as a common target for H(2)O(2) and IGF-1 and supports a novel tumor suppressive role for PML in controlling cell migration through the expression of ITGB1.","['Reineke, Erin L', 'Liu, Yu', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Reineke EL', 'Liu Y', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.

Research has since focused on the area of chromosome 17 in which HER2/neu is located in order to identify other genes in the vicinity. The aims of this review are, firstly, to discuss current thinking in relation to the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and, secondly, to examine how this evidence may be assimilated such that new forms of targeted therapy can be developed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This review discusses the evidence in relation to 4 genes located at the HER2/neu amplicon, namely TOP2A, GRB7, STARD3 and RARA. RESULTS: TOP2A has aroused particular interest as over-expression of its protein has been shown to correlate, both with amplification of HER2/neu, and with response to anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer. GRB7 is included on Oncotype DXtm, and has recently been implicated in gastric and oesophageal cancer. STARD3 and RARA also hold clinical relevance, the former having been shown to function in steroidogenesis and therefore implicated in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Finally, RARA may be the key to unlocking the problem of resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in breast cancer sufferers; this treatment has previously been demonstrated to induce remission in over 80% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML). CONCLUSION: These genes hold potential as therapeutic targets, and warrant further investigation as we move towards our goal of individually tailored therapeutic strategies in breast cancer.","['Glynn, R W', 'Miller, N', 'Kerin, M J']","['Glynn RW', 'Miller N', 'Kerin MJ']","['Department of Surgery, Clinical Science Institute, National University of Ireland, Costello Road, Galway, Ireland. ronanglynn@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GRB7 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (STARD3 protein, human)', '149058-53-7 (GRB7 Adaptor Protein)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Female', 'GRB7 Adaptor Protein/physiology', '*Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(09)00189-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2009.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2010 May;36(3):224-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2009.12.007.

INTERVENTION(S): Ovarian cortex from each patient was examined with histology and immunohistochemistry. In addition, in eight cases a specific chromosomal abnormality could be used as a genetic marker for detection of malignant cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Evidence of malignant cells by immunohistochemistry or PCR. RESULT(S): Histology and immunohistochemistry did not reveal malignant cell infiltration in the ovarian cortex of any of the patients. In six of the eight patients (75%) with chromosomal abnormalities in the malignant cells, PCR showed evidence of leukemic cells in the ovarian tissue. CONCLUSION(S): Immunohistochemistry was unable to locate leukemic cells in the ovarian cortex; however, PCR detected potentially malignant cells in the majority of cases. The viability and malignancy of these cells remains to be determined. At present, reimplantation of ovarian cortex to leukemia patients cannot be recommended.","['Rosendahl, Mikkel', 'Andersen, Morten Tolstrup', 'Ralfkiaer, Elisabeth', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Andersen, Claus Yding']","['Rosendahl M', 'Andersen MT', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Andersen MK', 'Andersen CY']","['Laboratory of Reproductive Biology and The Fertility Clinic, Department of Clinical Genetics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. mikro@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cryopreservation/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infertility, Female/prevention & control', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Ovary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0015-0282(09)04112-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.11.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2010 Nov;94(6):2186-90. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.11.032.

The combination of drug uptake in malignant tissues and selective delivery of laser-generated light provides an effective therapy with efficient tumor citotoxicity and minimal normal tissue damage. Since immune response of the host is important in the control of tumor growth and spreading, PDT is able to increase the antitumor immunity. In our laboratory we examined the antitumor effect of combination of PDT, with photoactivated M-THPC (meta-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin, FOSCAN, Temoporphirin), adoptive immunotherapy, with immune lymphocytes, and chemotherapy on advanced murine tumors. Mice bearing L1210 tumor were treated at day +4 with Navelbine (NVB 1mg/Kg), at day +5,+6 with PDT (0.3mg/Kg of mTHPC and 100mW/cm(2) x 200'' of exposure of laser light), and at day + 7 with immune lymphocytes(IL), collected from mice pretreated with PDT(2x10(7) cells). The results show that the combination NVB + PDT + IL demonstrates a significant synergistic antitumor effect while the chemotherapy treatment with low dose of the drug is uneffective.

Biochemical correlates of minimal myocardial changes can be analyzed using a commercially available rapid assay. Biomarkers are considered more sensitive markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity than conventional electrocardiographic and echocardiographic methods. The aim of this study was to determine the values of plasma N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in asymptomatic childhood leukemia survivors after anthracycline therapy in comparison with healthy volunteers. The survivors also underwent a detailed echocardiography. Twenty six survivors of leukemia previously treated with anthracyclines with total cumulative dose 95-600 (median 221) mg/m(2) were evaluated. Analyses of cTnT and NT-proBNP from blood samples and echocardiography were performed 5-25 years after completion of therapy for childhood leukemia. Control group for biochemical analyses consisted of 22 age- and gender- matched apparently healthy volunteers. Values of NT-proBNP were significantly elevated in ANT group compared to controls (35.1 +/- 37.8 vs. 9.6 +/- 6.7 pg/ml, P<0.010). CTnT remained below the diagnostic cut-off values in both groups. All echocardiographic parameters of patients remained normal. In conclusion, differences in NT-proBNP values between patients treated with anthracyclines and healthy volunteers might signal an initial stage of anthracycline-induced myocardial damage. The potential of this biomarker to detect subclinical anthracycline-induced myocardial alterations before development of echocardiographic and clinical changes is promising.","['Urbanova, D', 'Urban, L', 'Simkova, I', 'Danova, K', 'Mikuskova, E', 'Mladosievicova, B']","['Urbanova D', 'Urban L', 'Simkova I', 'Danova K', 'Mikuskova E', 'Mladosievicova B']","['The Institute of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Stroke Volume', 'Survivors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Troponin T/*blood', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2010_02_179 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2010;57(2):179-83. doi: 10.4149/neo_2010_02_179.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determination of disease prognosis is based on the identification of different prognostic factors. The concept of CLL prognostic factors is still developing and has undergone several fundamental changes. Traditional (old) prognostic factors and staging systems are useful in describing the extent of the disease at any given moment, in determining clinical progression and in the identification of patients who need to start treatment. However, traditional prognostic factors are not sufficient for predicting a long-term prognosis because they are not able to identify potentially aggressive forms of CLL in the early stages. Nevertheless, clinical staging systems maintain their importance and in contrast to other traditional factors also their independent prognostic role. Otherwise, traditional prognostic factors play the role of disease activity descriptors rather than the role of actual prognostic factors. CLL risk profile determination is based on the identification of so-called new prognostic factors, the most relevant of which are chromosomal aberrations, TP53 gene mutations, mutational status of IgVH genes, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression. These factors are able to predict the prognosis already at the time of the initial diagnosis. In contrast to previous ideas, they are not incorporated into recommendations regarding indications for treatment. This is due to the risks associated with early treatment and the lack of data validated in prospective clinical trials demonstrating the justifiability of such procedure. In patients being treated, new prognostic factors may be useful for predicting the response to the therapy and some of them may directly influence the choice of treatment regime. New CLL treatment modalities have also raised the question of their influence on the prognostic and predictive power of new prognostic factors.","['Balharek, T', 'Barthova, M', 'Szepe, P', 'Marcinek, J', 'Burjanivova, T', 'Plank, L']","['Balharek T', 'Barthova M', 'Szepe P', 'Marcinek J', 'Burjanivova T', 'Plank L']","['Ustav patologickej anatomie a Konzuitacne centrum bioptickej diagnostiky ochoreni krvotvorby JLF UK a MFN, Martin, Slovenska republika. balharek@jfmed.uniba.sk']",['cze'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",2010/01/27 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2010/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2009;22(6):254-63.,,,64,,,,,,Komentar k vyvoju konceptu prognostickych faktorov chronickej lymfocytovej leukemie: cesta od prognostickych faktorov k prediktorom liecebnej odpovede.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma monitoring of imatinib levels would appear to be practical in cases where there is lack of response, heightened toxicity, or evidence of poor adherence to therapy. However, the potential role of monitoring plasma drug concentrations in guiding treatment decisions and optimizing patient therapy has yet to be established. Currently, there are no clinical recommendations regarding how to incorporate imatinib drug plasma monitoring in patients with either chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors, indications for which imatinib is approved. Here, the latest research and evidence regarding imatinib drug plasma monitoring is discussed. Three cases are presented to illustrate the most common examples where monitoring imatinib plasma concentrations may help to guide treatment decisions. These cases include a suboptimal response to imatinib treatment, lack of patient adherence to imatinib, and imatinib-related toxicity.

Increased sensitivity of hepatocytes toward apoptosis results in chronic liver injury, whereas apoptosis resistance is linked to hepatocarcinogenesis and nonresponsiveness to therapy-induced cell death. Recently, we have demonstrated an essential role of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in hepatocyte survival. In mice lacking Mcl-1 specifically in hepatocytes (Mcl-1(Deltahep)), spontaneous apoptosis caused severe liver damage. Here, we demonstrate that chronically increased apoptosis of hepatocytes coincides with strong hepatocyte proliferation resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver cell tumor formation was observed in >50% of Mcl-1(Deltahep) mice already by the age of 8 months, whereas 12-month-old wild-type (wt) and heterozygous Mcl-1(flox/wt) mice lacked tumors. Tumors revealed a heterogenous spectrum ranging from small dysplastic nodules to HCC. The neoplastic nature of the tumors was confirmed by histology, expression of the HCC marker glutamine synthetase and chromosomal aberrations. Liver carcinogenesis in Mcl-1(Deltahep) mice was paralleled by markedly increased levels of Survivin, an important regulator of mitosis which is selectively overexpressed in common human cancers. CONCLUSION: This study provides in vivo evidence that increased apoptosis of hepatocytes not only impairs liver homeostasis but is also accompanied by hepatocyte proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Our findings might have implications for understanding apoptosis-related human liver diseases.","['Weber, Achim', 'Boger, Regina', 'Vick, Binje', 'Urbanik, Toni', 'Haybaeck, Johannes', 'Zoller, Stefan', 'Teufel, Andreas', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Galle, Peter R', 'Schuchmann, Marcus', 'Heikenwalder, Mathias', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning']","['Weber A', 'Boger R', 'Vick B', 'Urbanik T', 'Haybaeck J', 'Zoller S', 'Teufel A', 'Krammer PH', 'Opferman JT', 'Galle PR', 'Schuchmann M', 'Heikenwalder M', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.23479 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2010 Apr;51(4):1226-36. doi: 10.1002/hep.23479.,10.1002/hep.23479 [doi],,,,,"['R01 HL102175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL102175-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2936921,,,['NIHMS216466'],,['Hepatology. 2010 Apr;51(4):1110-2.

The diagnosis of NAI has serious social and legal implications. Other causes of retinal hemorrhages in an infant, such as birth trauma, accidental head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, other less common disorders of clotting, leukemia, and infections such as endocarditis, need to be considered and ruled out in making a diagnosis of NAI. METHODS: Descriptive case report. RESULTS: A 5-week-old child presented with rapid onset of symptoms of drowsiness and hypotonia, unilateral retinal hemorrhages, and an intracranial hemorrhage in the posterior fossa. NAI was high on the list of differential diagnosis, which caused considerable anxiety in the parents. The cause of the intracranial hemorrhage only became apparent at repeat neuroimaging several weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: The case is presented to point out arteriovenous malformation as a possible cause of retinal hemorrhages in this age group where an early diagnosis of the etiology is often not possible. A diagnosis of NAI, commonly associated with a similar clinical presentation, can have serious social and legal implications.","['Reddy, Aravind R', 'Clarke, Michael', 'Long, Vernon W']","['Reddy AR', 'Clarke M', 'Long VW']","['Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, St James University Hospital, Leeds, UK. ar@rcsed.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,,IM,"['*Child Abuse', 'Craniocerebral Trauma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2010/01/26 06:00,2011/06/24 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['F139915A-109A-4444-9A95-10BC17084252 [pii]', '10.1177/112067211002000427 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Ophthalmol. 2010 Jul-Aug;20(4):799-801. doi: 10.1177/112067211002000427.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appropriate regulation of HSC quiescence is thought to be crucial to maintain their lifelong function; however, the molecular pathways controlling stem cell quiescence remain poorly characterized. Likewise, the molecular events driving leukemogenesis remain elusive. In this study, we compare the gene expression profiles of steady-state bone marrow HSC to non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors; to HSC treated with mobilizing drugs that expand the HSC pool and induce egress from the marrow; and to leukemic HSC in a mouse model of chronic myelogenous leukemia. By intersecting the resulting lists of differentially regulated genes we identify a subset of molecules that are downregulated in all three circumstances, and thus may be particularly important for the maintenance and function of normal, quiescent HSC. These results identify potential key regulators of HSC and give insights into the clinically important processes of HSC mobilization for transplantation and leukemic development from cancer stem cells.","['Forsberg, E Camilla', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Prohaska, Susan S', 'Wagers, Amy J', 'Koeva, Martina', 'Stuart, Joshua M', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Forsberg EC', 'Passegue E', 'Prohaska SS', 'Wagers AJ', 'Koeva M', 'Stuart JM', 'Weissman IL']","['Institute for Biology of Stem Cells, Department of Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, United States of America. cforsber@ucsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2009/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008785 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jan 20;5(1):e8785. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008785.,10.1371/journal.pone.0008785 [doi],20100120,,,,"['R01 HL092471/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL088582/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01HL092471-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA086065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01DK053074/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL058770/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01HL088582-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL058770/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK053074/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL088582-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2808351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study reveals a high number of mammalian cell death inducing substances in biofilm-associated diatoms sampled from the intertidal zone. Extracts from the genera Melosira, Amphora, Phaeodactylum and Nitzschia were all found to induce leukemia cell death, with either classical apoptotic or autophagic features. Several extracts also contained inhibitors of thrombin-induced blood platelet activation. Some of this activity was caused by a high content of adenosine in the diatoms, ranging from 0.07 to 0.31 microg/mg dry weight. However, most of the bioactivity was adenosine deaminase-resistant. An adenosine deaminase-resistant active fraction from one of the extracts was partially purified and shown to induce apoptosis with a distinct phenotype.

Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been used as a therapeutic agent to treat APL and other tumors. Studies suggest that ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation may improve the clinical outcome of As(2)O(3) for APL patients. Our aim was to use human leukemia (HL-60) APL-cells as an in vitro test model to evaluate the effect of physiologic doses of AA on As(2)O(3)-induced toxicity and apoptosis of HL-60 cells. METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated either with a pharmacologic dose of As(2)O(3) alone and with several physiologic doses of AA. Cell survival was determined by trypan blue exclusion test. The extent of oxidative cell/tissue damage was determined by measuring lipid hydroperoxide concentration by spectrophotometry. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. RESULTS: AA treatment potentiates the cytotoxicity of As(2)O(3) in HL-60 cells. Viability decreased from (58 +/- 3)% in cells with As(2)O(3) alone to (47 +/- 2)% in cells treated with 100 microM AA and 6 microg/mL As(2)O(3) with P < 0.05. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in lipid hydroperoxide concentrations in HL-60 cells co-treated with AA compared to As(2)O(3) alone. Flow cytometry assessment (Annexin V FITC/PI) suggested that AA co-treatment induces more apoptosis of HL-60 cells than did As(2)O(3) alone, but this was not statistically significant. Taken together, our experiment indicates that As(2)O(3) induced in vitro cell death and apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Administration of physiologic doses of AA enhanced As(2)O(3)-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative cell/tissue damage, and apoptosis of HL-60 cells through externalization of phosphatidylserine. CONCLUSIONS: These suggest that AA may enhance the cytotoxicity of As(2)O(3), suggesting a possible future role of AA/As(2)O(3) combination therapy in patients with APL.","['Yedjou, Clement', 'Thuisseu, Laurette', 'Tchounwou, Christine', 'Gomes, Maria', 'Howard, Carolyn', 'Tchounwou, Paul']","['Yedjou C', 'Thuisseu L', 'Tchounwou C', 'Gomes M', 'Howard C', 'Tchounwou P']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University Jackson, MS, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Drug Inf,Archives of drug information,101322852,,,,2010/01/26 06:00,2010/01/26 06:01,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1753-5174.2009.00022.x [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Drug Inf. 2009 Dec;2(4):59-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-5174.2009.00022.x.,,,,,,"['G11 HD046519/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR013459/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2805867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study extended previous research that suggested oxidative stress as a potential mechanism for chemotherapy-induced central nervous system injury by examining early markers of oxidative stress in relation to subsequent neurobehavioral problems. Oxidized and unoxidized components of phosphatidylcholine (PC) were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of 87 children with ALL at diagnosis, induction, and consolidation. Behavioral assessments were conducted postconsolidation and at the end of chemotherapy. Results revealed a significant association between physiologic reactivity (high vs. low PC changes from diagnosis) and behavioral outcomes (high vs. low pathology). Elevated oxidized PC fraction change was predictive of increased problems with aggression at the end of therapy as well as postconsolidation adaptability. Furthermore, symptoms of hyperactivity systematically changed over time in relation to both unoxidized PC and oxidized PC fraction reactivity. These findings suggest that symptoms of behavioral problems occur early in the course of chemotherapy and that increases in the cerebrospinal fluid PC markers of oxidative stress during induction and consolidation may help to predict certain future behavioral problems.","['Stenzel, Stephanie L', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn', 'Jain, Neelam', 'Kaemingk, Kris', 'Miketova, Petra', 'Moore, Ida M']","['Stenzel SL', 'Krull KR', 'Hockenberry M', 'Jain N', 'Kaemingk K', 'Miketova P', 'Moore IM']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child Behavior/*drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181c9af84 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Mar;32(2):113-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181c9af84.,10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181c9af84 [doi],,,,,"['R01 NR004905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HG000040/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'NR04905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 37816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD037816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3392027,,,['NIHMS378838'],,,,,,,,,,,,

While cisplatin (CisPt) is known to be a substance that is untransportable by P-gp, P-gp positive cells were often found to be resistant to CisPt. The aim of the current paper is to study this phenomenon using P-gp positive mouse leukemia cells L1210/VCR in which the overexpression of P-gp was induced by its ability to adapt to growth on vincristine (VCR). L1210/VCR cells are also resistant to CisPt. However, resistance to this substance could not be reversed by addition of the known P-gp inhibitor verapamil. CisPt induced more pronounced entry into apoptosis, as measured using the annexin V/propidium iodide kit, in sensitive L1210 cells than in resistant L1210/VCR cells. In addition, CisPt induced an increase in the proportion of L1210 cells that were in the g2 phase of the cell cycle when compared to L1210/VCR cells, as measured by staining with propidium iodide. Similarly, a higher release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was induced by CisPt treatment in L1210 than in L1210/VCR cells. While similar levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were observed in sensitive and resistant cells, CisPt induced a more pronounced decrease of the Bcl-2 levels in L1210 cells than in L1210/VCR cells. Consistent with this observation, CisPt induced a larger decrease of the Bcl-2 content in the Bcl-2:Bax heterooligomer in L1210 cells than in L1210/VCR cells. Moreover, CisPt induced a similar apoptotic DNA fragmentation pattern in both resistant and sensitive cells. All of the above observations indicated that L1210/VCR cells are also resistant to CisPt and that this resistance is related to the differences in the regulatory mechanisms responsible for CisPt-induced apoptosis in L1210/VCR cells without any contribution from the drug efflux activity of P-gp.","['Gibalova, Lenka', 'Sedlak, Jan', 'Labudova, Martina', 'Barancik, Miroslav', 'Rehakova, Alena', 'Breier, Albert', 'Sulova, Zdena']","['Gibalova L', 'Sedlak J', 'Labudova M', 'Barancik M', 'Rehakova A', 'Breier A', 'Sulova Z']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Excellence of the Slovak Research and Development Agency BIOMEMBRANES 2008, Vlarska 5, 833 34 Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Necrosis/chemically induced', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/06/11 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/pb_2009_04_391 [doi]'],ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2009 Dec;28(4):391-403. doi: 10.4149/pb_2009_04_391.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine this possibility, we analyzed clinical outcomes in a cohort of 105 patients with myeloid malignancies who received T cell-replete grafts from HLA-matched sibling donors. Presence of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) for nonself HLA class I ligands had no effect on disease-free survival, incidence of relapse, or graft-versus-host disease. A longitudinal analysis of the NK-cell repertoire and function revealed a global hyporesponsiveness of NK cells early after transplantation. Functional responses recovered at approximately 6 months after transplantation. Importantly, NKG2A(-) NK cells expressing KIRs for nonself HLA class I ligands remained tolerant at all time points. Furthermore, a direct comparison of NK-cell reconstitution in T cell-replete and T cell-depleted HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation (SCT) revealed that NKG2A(+) NK cells dominated the functional repertoire early after transplantation, with intact tolerance of NKG2A(-) NK cells expressing KIRs for nonself ligands in both settings.

Recent genome-wide screening also revealed IDH1 mutation as a recurrent event in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its clinical implications in AML are largely unknown. We analyzed 493 adult Chinese AML patients in Taiwan and found 27 patients (5.5%) harboring this mutation. IDH1 mutation was strongly associated with normal karyotype (8.4%, P = .002), isolated monosomy 8 (P = .043), NPM1 mutation (P < .001), and French-American-British M1 subtype (P < .001), but inversely associated with French-American-British M4 subtype (P = .030) and expression of HLA-DR, CD13, and CD14 (P = .002, .003, and .038, respectively). There was no impact of this mutation on patient survival. Sequential analysis of IDH1 mutation was performed in 130 patients during follow-ups. None of the 112 patients without IDH1 mutation at diagnosis acquired this mutation at relapse. In all 18 IDH1-mutated patients studied, the mutation disappeared in complete remission; the same mutation reappeared in all 11 samples obtained at relapse. We conclude that IDH1 is associated with distinct clinical and biologic characteristics and seems to be very stable during disease evolution.","['Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Ko, Bor-Shen', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Huang, Yen-Ning', 'Chang, Yi-Chang', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chi', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Chen CY', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Tsay W', 'Ko BS', 'Wu SJ', 'Huang SY', 'Hsu SC', 'Chen YC', 'Huang YN', 'Chang YC', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

To understand the molecular mechanism by which methotrexate induces apoptosis, we analyzed the resulting intracellular protein changes in methotrexate-treated acute promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60) cells by cysteine-labeled differential in-gel electrophoresis (CL-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry. Initial CL-DIGE analysis revealed that 24 proteins were differentially expressed (p<0.05) in the HL-60 cell proteome after treatment with 2.5microM methotrexate for 72h. We found that three structural alpha4, alpha5, alpha7 proteasome subunits, a non-catalytic beta3 and two 26S regulatory proteasome subunits were down-regulated in methotrexate-treated HL-60 cells. Western blot analyses further showed that the inhibition of proteasome subunits is accompanied by suppression of NF-kappaB subunits and promotes the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, methotrexate activated unfolded protein response by inducing the expression of endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins such as calreticulin, protein disulphide isomerase A3 and A4, and 78kDa glucose regulated protein in a time-dependent manner. Altogether, our findings demonstrated that targeting NF-kappaB, structural and regulatory proteasome subunits with methotrexate may provide new insight into understanding methotrexate-induced apoptotic activities in HL-60 cells.","['Agarwal, Nitin Kumar', 'Mueller, Gerhard Anton', 'Mueller, Claudia', 'Streich, Jan-Henrick', 'Asif, Abdul Rahman', 'Dihazi, Hassan']","['Agarwal NK', 'Mueller GA', 'Mueller C', 'Streich JH', 'Asif AR', 'Dihazi H']","['Department of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Center of Internal Medicine, Georg-August University Gottingen, D-37075, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proteomics', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1570-9639(10)00004-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Apr;1804(4):918-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.01.002.

However, unlike Daxx, nuclear Zac1 was not relocalized into PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). The enhancement of the transactivation activity of Zac1 by PML and Daxx might occur outside PML-NBs. Other components of PML-NBs, such as CREB-binding protein (CBP), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9, and p53, were also regulatory targets for Zac1, for whom the locations to mediate its regulatory functions were distinct from PML-NBs.

Our study was initiated in order to determine the effect of the pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, canertinib (CI-1033), on growth and survival of human leukemia (HL-60 and U-937) cells. We show that treatment of HL-60 and U-937 cells with canertinib significantly inhibits growth of both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner; half maximal effective dose (IC(50)) in HL-60 and U-937 cells was approximately 2.5 microM and 1.0 microM, respectively. Treatment with 2 microM canertinib promoted a G(1) cell cycle arrest, whereas doses of 5 microM or more induced apoptosis as determined by the Annexin V method and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). HL-60 and U-937 cells lacked EGF-receptor transcript but expressed ErbB2-4 mRNA as determined by RT-PCR. However, none of the corresponding ErbB-receptor proteins could be detected by Western blot analysis. We conclude that canertinib induces apoptosis in HL-60 and U-937 cells devoid of functional ErbB1-4 receptors. Our results suggest that canertinib could be of potential clinical interest in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Trinks, Cecilia', 'Djerf, Emelie A', 'Hallbeck, Anna-Lotta', 'Jonsson, Jan-Ingvar', 'Walz, Thomas M']","['Trinks C', 'Djerf EA', 'Hallbeck AL', 'Jonsson JI', 'Walz TM']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, S-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden. cecilia.trinks@liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'C78W1K5ASF (Canertinib)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)00094-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.01.055 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Feb 26;393(1):6-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.01.055.

To evaluate their prognostic significance, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Eleven studies covering a total of 1063 subjects were included in this review. Incidence of ITD and TKD mutations was 12-38% and 2-20%, respectively. In 9 of 11 studies, ITD was associated with high WBC count at the time of diagnosis, which is a known prognostic indicator in APL. Patients with ITD had inferior 3-year overall survival compared to patients without ITD (risk ratio 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04-1.95). Similarly, ITD was also associated with adverse 3-year disease-free survival (risk ratio 1.48, 95% CI: 1.02-2.15). There were only two studies that evaluated the association of TKD mutation in APL; both showed a trend towards worse survival in patients with mutated TKD. In conclusion, FLT3 ITD is associated with high WBC at diagnosis in patients with APL. Although the available literature is limited to observational studies, our systematic review suggests that FLT3 mutations, especially ITD, can adversely affect overall survival and disease-free survival in APL.","['Beitinjaneh, Amer', 'Jang, Sekwon', 'Roukoz, Henri', 'Majhail, Navneet S']","['Beitinjaneh A', 'Jang S', 'Roukoz H', 'Majhail NS']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. abeitin@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*physiology']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00002-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jul;34(7):831-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.01.001.

To test whether the microenvironment impacts on leukemic phenotype, we exploited the MN1 model of acute myeloid leukemia under defined genetically modified microenvironmental conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The requirement of both FLT3 and c-Kit signaling for MN1 leukemias was investigated using retroviral infection of bone marrow cells from wild-type, c-Kit-mutated (W41), and Flt3-ligand knockout cells, and bone marrow transplantation into wild-type, c-Kit-mutated, or Flt3-ligand knockout mice. RESULTS: Genetic disruption of both FLT3 and c-Kit signaling in the MN1-leukemia model was dispensable for MN1-induced leukemogenesis. However, it induced a switch from myeloid to erythroid phenotype that was preserved, when FLT3 signaling was restored by secondary transplantation of leukemic cells into wild-type recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the importance of microenvironmental signals for lineage choice in leukemia and identify signals that are important in myeloid-erythroid lineage decisions.","['Heuser, Michael', 'Park, Gyeongsin', 'Moon, Yeonsook', 'Berg, Tobias', 'Xiang, Ping', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Vollett, Sarah', 'Lai, Courteney', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Heuser M', 'Park G', 'Moon Y', 'Berg T', 'Xiang P', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Vollett S', 'Lai C', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2009/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00011-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Mar;38(3):174-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.01.003.

The two-photon photoluminescence images of gold nanorods were acquired by an 800 nm fs laser with the power of milliwatts. The advantages of the obtained two-photon photoluminescence images are high spatial resolution and reduced background. However, a remarkable photothermal effect on cells was seen after 30 times continuous scanning of the femto-second laser, potentially affecting the subcellular localization pattern of the nanorods. In the case of confocal reflectance microscopy the images of gold nanorods can be obtained with the power of light source as low as microwatts, thus avoiding the photothermal effect, but the resolution of such images is reduced. We have noted that confocal reflectance images of cellular gold nanorods achieved with 50 microW 800 nm fs have a relatively poor resolution, whereas the 50 microW 488 nm CW laser can acquire reasonably satisfactory 3D reflectance images with improved resolution because of its shorter wavelength.

However, concurrent chemotherapy is still necessary and less toxic therapeutic approaches are needed. Earlier studies suggested that in haematopoietic neoplasms, the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) induces cell death without adversely affecting healthy cells. We aimed at deciphering the molecular mechanism of EGCG-induced cell death in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). A significant increase of death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) levels was found in AML cells upon EGCG treatment paralleled by increased cell death that was significantly reduced upon silencing of DAPK2. Moreover, combined ATRA and EGCG treatment resulted in cooperative DAPK2 induction and potentiated differentiation. EGCG toxicity of primary AML blasts correlated with 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) expression. Pretreatment of AML cells with ATRA, causing downregulation of 67LR, rendered these cells resistant to EGCG-mediated cell death. In summary, it was found that (i) DAPK2 is essential for EGCG-induced cell death in AML cells, (ii) ATRA and EGCG cotreatment significantly boosted neutrophil differentiation, and 67LR expression correlates with susceptibility of AML cells to EGCG. We thus suggest that EGCG, by selectively targeting leukaemic cells, may improve differentiation therapies for APL and chemotherapy for other AML subtypes.","['Britschgi, Adrian', 'Simon, Hans-Uwe', 'Tobler, Andreas', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Tschan, Mario P']","['Britschgi A', 'Simon HU', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF', 'Tschan MP']","['Department of Clinical Research, Experimental Oncology/Haematology, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/01/26 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8040 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08040.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Apr;149(1):55-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08040.x.

We characterized abnormalities of chromosome 20 as defined by metaphase cytogenetics (MC) in patients with myeloid neoplasms to define commonly deleted regions (CDR) and commonly retained regions (CRR) using genome-wide, high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analysis. We reviewed the MC results of a cohort of 1,162 patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasia (MDS/MPN), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We further analyzed a subcohort of 532 patients by SNP-A using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Nsp arrays. By MC, 5% (54/1,162) harbored a deletion of 20q; in 30% (16/54), del(20q) was the sole cytogenetic abnormality. By SNP-A analysis, we identified del(20q) in 23 patients, 3 not detected by MC. In four cases, monosomy 20 with a marker chromosome by MC was proven to be an interstitial deletion of 20q by SNP-A. We defined 2 CDR and 2 CRR on chromosome arm 20q: CDR1 spanned 2.5 Mb between bands 20q11.23 and 20q12, while CDR2 encompassed 1.8 Mb within 20q13.12. CRR1 spanned 1.9 Mb within 20q11.21 and CRR2 encompassed 2.5 Mb within 20q13.33. In contrast to other chromosomes frequently affected by deletions, no somatic copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) was detected. Our data suggest that SNP-A is useful for the detection of cryptic aberrations of chromosome 20q and allows for a more precise characterization of complex karyotypes. Furthermore, SNP-A allowed definition of a CDR on 20q.","['Huh, Jungwon', 'Tiu, Ramon V', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Jasek, Monika', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Jankowska, Ania M', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Verma, Amit', 'Theil, Karl S', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Huh J', 'Tiu RV', 'Gondek LP', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Jasek M', 'Makishima H', 'Jankowska AM', 'Jiang Y', 'Verma A', 'Theil KS', 'McDevitt MA', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20748 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Apr;49(4):390-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20748.,10.1002/gcc.20748 [doi],,,,,['R01HL098511/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCV-infected patients are also prone to developing peripheral cytopenias, the etiologies of which are multifactorial and include hypersplenism and/or antiviral medications. Some of these patients may undergo bone marrow biopsy but no study has systematically recorded the bone marrow findings in this patient group. Here, we report on the range of bone marrow findings in 47 adult HCV-infected patients. These patients, who lacked concurrent human immunodefiency virus (HIV) infection, most commonly presented for a bone marrow biopsy due to abnormal peripheral cell counts. The bone marrow biopsies displayed a range of findings. Dyserythropoiesis, present in 19% of the cases, was the most common finding. Patients with pancytopenia(n = 6), as defined by current World Health Organization standards, were the most likely to have bone marrow abnormalities; two pancytopenic patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and one patient had a primary myelodysplastic syndrome. There was no correlation in bone marrow findings and antiviral medications, MELD score, cirrhosis or splenomegaly, suggesting that the degree of bone marrow dysfunction is independent of stage of HCV. The results of this study suggest that bone marrow biopsy in HCV-infected patients, even those with features of hypersplenism and/or documented antiviral therapy, can be a valid test for hematologic evaluation, especially for patients with severe pancytopenia and/or sudden alterations in peripheral cell counts.","['Klco, Jeffery M', 'Geng, Bob', 'Brunt, Elizabeth M', 'Hassan, Anjum', 'Nguyen, Tu-Dung', 'Kreisel, Friederike H', 'Lisker-Melman, Mauricio', 'Frater, John L']","['Klco JM', 'Geng B', 'Brunt EM', 'Hassan A', 'Nguyen TD', 'Kreisel FH', 'Lisker-Melman M', 'Frater JL']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', '*Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C/blood/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology', 'Pancytopenia/blood/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21600 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Feb;85(2):106-10. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21600.,10.1002/ajh.21600 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that flunarizine was cytotoxic for Jurkat T-leukemia cells, as well as for other hematological maligancies, but not for breast or colon carcinoma cells. Treatment of Jurkat cells with flunarizine resulted in caspase-3 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and laddering of DNA fragments, all of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Flunarizine-induced DNA fragmentation was inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, the caspase-8/caspase-10 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk, and the caspase-10 inhibitor z-AEVD-fmk, but was not reduced in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells, indicating the involvement of caspase-10 upstream of caspase-3 activation. Interestingly, FADD recruitment to a death receptor was not involved since flunarizine caused DNA fragmentation in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. Flunarizine treatment of Jurkat cells also resulted in reactive oxygen species production, dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and caspase-9 activation, although none of these events were necessary for apoptosis induction. Collectively, these findings indicate that flunarizine triggers apoptosis in Jurkat cells via FADD-independent activation of caspase-10. Flunarizine warrants further investigation as a potential anti-cancer agent for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Conrad, David M', 'Furlong, Suzanne J', 'Doucette, Carolyn D', 'West, Kenneth A', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Conrad DM', 'Furlong SJ', 'Doucette CD', 'West KA', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1X5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-alanyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'R7PLA2DM0J (Flunarizine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 10/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flunarizine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/06/19 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-010-0454-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2010 May;15(5):597-607. doi: 10.1007/s10495-010-0454-3.,10.1007/s10495-010-0454-3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, relapses with emerging imatinib-resistance mutations in the BCR/ABL kinase domain pose a significant problem. Here, we demonstrate that nutlin-3, an inhibitor of Mdm2, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis more effectively in BCR/ABL-driven Ton.B210 cells than in those driven by IL-3. Moreover, nutlin-3 drastically enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in various BCR/ABL-expressing cells, which included primary leukemic cells from patients with CML blast crisis or Ph+ ALL and cells expressing the imatinib-resistant E255K BCR/ABL mutant. Nutlin-3 and imatinib synergistically induced Bax activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and caspase-3 cleavage leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-XL. Imatinib did not significantly affect the nutlin-3-induced expression of p53 but abrogated that of p21. Furthermore, activation of Bax as well as caspase-3 induced by combined treatment with imatinib and nutlin-3 was observed preferentially in cells expressing p21 at reduced levels. The present study indicates that combined treatment with nutlin-3 and imatinib activates p53 without inducing p21 and synergistically activates Bax-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway to induce apoptosis in BCR/ABL-expressing cells.","['Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Wu, Nan', 'Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Kagechika, Hiroyuki', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Kurosu T', 'Wu N', 'Oshikawa G', 'Kagechika H', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', '*Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/06/19 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-010-0457-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2010 May;15(5):608-20. doi: 10.1007/s10495-010-0457-0.,10.1007/s10495-010-0457-0 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been determined that these stem-like tumor cells, termed cancer stem cells, are the primary cellular component within a tumor that drives disease progression and metastasis. In addition to their stem-like ability to self-renew and differentiate, cancer stem cells are also enriched in cells resistant to conventional radiation therapy and to chemotherapy. The immediate implications of this new tumor growth paradigm not only require a re-evaluation of how tumors are initiated, but also on how tumors should be monitored and treated. However, despite the relatively rapid pace of cancer stem cell research in solid tumors such as breast, brain, and colon cancers, similar progress in lung cancer remains hampered in part due to an incomplete understanding of lung epithelial stem cell hierarchy and the complex heterogeneity of the disease.

These chromosomal translocations commonly result in MLL fusion proteins that dysregulate transcription. Recent data suggest that the MYB proto-oncogene, which is an important regulator of hematopoietic cell development, has a role in leukemogenesis driven by the MLL-ENL fusion protein, but exactly how is unclear. Here we have demonstrated that c-Myb is recruited to the MLL histone methyl transferase complex by menin, a protein important for MLL-associated leukemic transformation, and that it contributes substantially to MLL-mediated methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). Silencing MYB in human leukemic cell lines and primary patient material evoked a global decrease in H3K4 methylation, an unexpected decrease in HOXA9 and MEIS1 gene expression, and decreased MLL and menin occupancy in the HOXA9 gene locus. This decreased occupancy was associated with a diminished ability of an MLL-ENL fusion protein to transform normal mouse hematopoietic cells. Previous studies have shown that MYB expression is regulated by Hoxa9 and Meis1, indicating the existence of an autoregulatory feedback loop. The finding that c-Myb has the ability to direct epigenetic marks, along with its participation in an autoregulatory feedback loop with genes known to transform hematopoietic cells, lends mechanistic and translationally relevant insight into its role in MLL-associated leukemogenesis.","['Jin, Shenghao', 'Zhao, Huiwu', 'Yi, Yan', 'Nakata, Yuji', 'Kalota, Anna', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Jin S', 'Zhao H', 'Yi Y', 'Nakata Y', 'Kalota A', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2008/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['38030 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI38030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Feb;120(2):593-606. doi: 10.1172/JCI38030.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the MRI findings and clinical manifestations in 32 cases of granulocytic sarcoma of the spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients (21 males, 11 females; mean age, 32 years) with myeloid leukemia and spinal granulocytic sarcoma were included in this study. All of the patients underwent radiotherapy with chemotherapy, and four patients underwent surgical decompression or excisional biopsy. All 32 patients underwent MRI of the spine; 21 patients underwent follow-up MRI. RESULTS: Nine patients had spinal granulocytic sarcoma in the initial manifestation of leukemia. The other 23 diagnoses were made during a remission or relapse period. The lumbosacral and thoracic portions of the spine were commonly involved. Twenty-seven patients had multiple or contiguous multilevel involvement. According to location, spinal granulocytic sarcoma was classified as epidural in the central spinal canal, epidural along the nerve course, thickening of the nerve root itself, or prevertebral. Lesions were seen as isointense on T1-weighted images and had intermediate signal intensity with homogeneous enhancement on T2-weighted images. Nine patients had complete reduction of the tumor volume, and 12 patients had partial reduction. The median survival period was 9 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 41%. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the imaging findings of spinal granulocytic sarcoma, which consists of multiple extramedullary masses with diffuse leukemic bone marrow infiltration, can lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment to reduce neurologic symptoms.","['Seok, Jee Hyun', 'Park, Jeongmi', 'Kim, Sun Ki', 'Choi, Jung Eun', 'Kim, Choon-Choo']","['Seok JH', 'Park J', 'Kim SK', 'Choi JE', 'Kim CC']","[""Department of Radiology, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

To investigate the cellular origin of LMO2-induced leukemia, we used cell fate mapping to study mice in which the Lmo2 gene was constitutively expressed in the thymus. Lmo2 induced self-renewal of committed T cells in the mice more than 8 months before the development of overt T-ALL. These self-renewing cells retained the capacity for T cell differentiation but expressed several genes typical of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that Lmo2 might reactivate an HSC-specific transcriptional program. Forced expression of one such gene, Hhex, was sufficient to initiate self-renewal of thymocytes in vivo. Thus, Lmo2 promotes the self-renewal of preleukemic thymocytes, providing a mechanism by which committed T cells can then accumulate additional genetic mutations required for leukemic transformation.","['McCormack, Matthew P', 'Young, Lauren F', 'Vasudevan, Sumitha', 'de Graaf, Carolyn A', 'Codrington, Rosalind', 'Rabbitts, Terence H', 'Jane, Stephen M', 'Curtis, David J']","['McCormack MP', 'Young LF', 'Vasudevan S', 'de Graaf CA', 'Codrington R', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Jane SM', 'Curtis DJ']","['Rotary Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Grattan Street, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia. mccormack@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hhex protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Oncogenes', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/*physiology/transplantation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Preleukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['science.1182378 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1182378 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2010 Feb 12;327(5967):879-83. doi: 10.1126/science.1182378.

Although in vitro immortalization by HTLV-I virus is very efficient, we report that Tax has poor oncogenic activity in human primary T cells and that immortalization by Tax is rare. Sustained telomerase activity represents one of the oncogenic steps required for Tax-mediated immortalization. Tax expression was required for the growth of primary T cells, but was not sufficient to propel T cells into cell cycle in the absence of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). Tax was sufficient to activate the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway as shown by down regulation of Src homology phosphatase-1 and increased phosphorylation of Akt. We also found disruption of putative tumor suppressors IL-16 and translocated promoter region (TPR) in Tax-immortalized and HTLV-I-transformed cell lines. Our results confirmed previous observations that Tax activates the anaphase-promoting complex. However, Tax did not affect the mitotic spindle checkpoint, which was also functional in HTLV-I-transformed cells. These data provide a better understanding of Tax functions in human T cells, and highlight the limitations of Tax, suggesting that other viral proteins are key to T-cell transformation and development of adult T-cell leukemia.","['Bellon, Marcia', 'Baydoun, Hicham H', 'Yao, Yuan', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bellon M', 'Baydoun HH', 'Yao Y', 'Nicot C']","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, KU Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Genomic Instability/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Telomere/physiology']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56595-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-241117 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 25;115(12):2441-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-241117.

Cavernosal strips from wild-type (WT), endothelial nitric-oxide synthase knockout [eNOS(-/-)], and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase knockout [nNOS(-/-)] mice were mounted in myographs, and isometric force was recorded. mRNA and protein expression of key molecules in the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The cGMP levels were determined. The Rho-kinase inhibitors (R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide (Y-27632) and (S)-(+)-2-methyl-1-[(4-methyl-5-isoquinolinyl)sulfonyl] homopiperazine (H-1152) reduced cavernosal contractions evoked by phenylephrine or electrical field stimulation (EFS) in a concentration-dependent manner, although this inhibition was less effective in tissues from eNOS(-/-) mice. Y-27632 enhanced relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside, EFS, and NO (administered as acidified NaNO2) without affecting the cGMP content of the cavernosal strips. This enhancement was less prominent in CC from eNOS(-/-). The protein expression of RhoA, Rho-guanine dissociation inhibitor, and Rho-kinase beta did not differ among the strains. However, in eNOS(-/-) CC, the protein expression of Rho-kinase alpha and both mRNA and protein expression of p115-Rho-associated guanine exchange factor (RhoGEF), PDZ-RhoGEF, and leukemia-associated RhoGEF were up-regulated. Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 was higher in tissues from eNOS(-/-) mice. A high concentration of Y-27632 significantly enhanced NO release in CC stimulated by EFS. These results suggest a basal release of NO from endothelial cells, which inhibits contractions mediated by the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway and modulates the expression of proteins related to this pathway in mouse CC. It indicates that endothelial integrity is essential to the maintenance of erectile function.","['Priviero, Fernanda B M', 'Jin, Li-Ming', 'Ying, Zhekang', 'Teixeira, Cleber E', 'Webb, R Clinton']","['Priviero FB', 'Jin LM', 'Ying Z', 'Teixeira CE', 'Webb RC']","['Rua Jose Aparecido Pavan, 190, 13086-080, Campinas-SP, Brazil. fernanda.bmp@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (2-methyl-1-((4-methyl-5-isoquinolinyl)sulfonyl)homopiperazine)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '138381-45-0 (Y 27632)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RhoA protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Relaxation', 'Muscle, Smooth/blood supply/innervation/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I/*genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/*genetics', 'Penis/blood supply/*enzymology/innervation', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity', 'Up-Regulation', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'rho-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.109.160606 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.109.160606 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2010 Apr;333(1):184-92. doi: 10.1124/jpet.109.160606.

Several methods have emerged to try to best identify these abnormalities. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine the frequency of cytogenetic changes in our CLL patient population. We also evaluated the effectiveness of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in detecting these abnormalities. Sixty-two B-CLL patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled, and FISH and MLPA analyses were performed on peripheral blood samples. Using FISH, genomic aberrations were found in 73% of patients and presented as follows: single 13q14.3 deletion (60%), trisomy 12 (7%), ATM deletion (6%), 17p13.1 deletion (2%). MLPA analyses done on 61/62 patients showed sensitivity and specificity values of 90% and 100% respectively. MLPA revealed several additional copy number changes, the most common being 19p13 (LDLR and CDKN2D). Moreover, the cost for MLPA analysis, including technical time and reagents, is 86% less than FISH. In conclusion, cytogenetic abnormalities are a common finding in CLL patients, and MLPA is a reliable approach that is more cost effective and faster than FISH. Despite MLPA limitations of sensitivity, it can be used as a first-line screen and complementary test to FISH analysis.","['Al Zaabi, Eiman A', 'Fernandez, Louis A', 'Sadek, Irene A', 'Riddell, D Christie', 'Greer, Wenda L']","['Al Zaabi EA', 'Fernandez LA', 'Sadek IA', 'Riddell DC', 'Greer WL']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, 5788 University Avenue, Mackenzie Building, Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS, B3H 1V8 Canada.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/instrumentation/*methods', 'Karyotyping/methods', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/instrumentation/*methods']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60048-7 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090046 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2010 Mar;12(2):197-203. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090046.

By Real-Time-PCR and western blot analysis, we found that TRPV2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed in benign astrocyte tissues, and its expression progressively declined in high-grade glioma tissues as histological grade increased (n = 49 cases), and in U87MG cells and in MZC, FCL and FSL primary glioma cells. To investigate the function of TRPV2 in glioma, small RNA interfering was used to silence TRPV2 expression in U87MG cells. As evaluated by RT-Profiler PCR array, siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells displayed a marked downregulation of Fas and procaspase-8 mRNA expression, associated with upregulation of cyclin E1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, E2F1 transcriptor factor 1, V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-X(L)) mRNA expression. TRPV2 silencing increased U87MG cell proliferation as shown by the increased percentage of cells incorporating 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine expressing beta(III)-tubulin and rescued glioma cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. These events were dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation: indeed inhibition of ERK activation in siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells by treatment with PD98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, reduced Bcl-X(L) protein levels, promoted Fas expression, and restored Akt/protein kinase B pathway activation leading to reduced U87MG cell survival and proliferation, and increased sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, transfection of TRPV2 in MZC glioma cells, by inducing Fas overexpression, resulted in a reduced viability and an increased spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. Overall, our findings indicate that TRPV2 negatively controls glioma cell survival and proliferation, as well as resistance to Fas-induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK-dependent manner.","['Nabissi, Massimo', 'Morelli, Maria Beatrice', 'Amantini, Consuelo', 'Farfariello, Valerio', 'Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia', 'Caprodossi, Sara', 'Arcella, Antonella', 'Santoni, Matteo', 'Giangaspero, Felice', 'De Maria, Ruggero', 'Santoni, Giorgio']","['Nabissi M', 'Morelli MB', 'Amantini C', 'Farfariello V', 'Ricci-Vitiani L', 'Caprodossi S', 'Arcella A', 'Santoni M', 'Giangaspero F', 'De Maria R', 'Santoni G']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Public Health, University of Camerino, 62032 Camerino (Macerata), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV2 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'TRPV Cation Channels/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq019 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq019 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 May;31(5):794-803. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq019.

Because of the rarity of idic(X)(q13), little is known about its formation, whether a fusion gene is generated, and patterns of additional aberrations. We here present an SNP array study of 14 idic(X)-positive myeloid malignancies, collected through an international collaborative effort. The breakpoints clustered in two regions of segmental duplications and were not in a gene, making dosage effects from the concurrent gain of Xpter-q13 and loss of Xq13-qter, rather than a fusion gene, the most likely pathogenetic outcome. Methylation analysis revealed involvement of the inactive X chromosomes in five cases and of the active in two. The ABCB7 gene, mutated in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and spinocerebellar ataxia, is in the deleted region, suggesting that loss of this gene underlies the frequent presence of ringed sideroblasts. Additional genetic abnormalities were present in 12/14 (86%), including partial uniparental disomies for 9p (one case) and 4q (two cases) associated with homozygous mutations of JAK2 and TET2, respectively. In total, TET2 mutations were seen in 4/11 (36%) analyzed cases, thus constituting a common secondary event in idic(X)-positive malignancies.","['Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Paulsson K', 'Haferlach C', 'Fonatsch C', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Andersen MK', 'Slovak ML', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. kajsa.paulsson@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Breaks', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Segmental Duplications, Genomic']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ddq024 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddq024 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2010 Apr 15;19(8):1507-14. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddq024.

In this study, we investigated the direct effects of glucosamine and related compounds on mast cell mediated inflammation using cultured mast cells and an animal model. MAIN METHODS: Dinitrophenyl (DNP)-IgE-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells were treated with glucosamine-HCl (GlcN-HCl), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer. Cells were stimulated by DNP-BSA to induce degranulation and released beta-hexosaminedase was determined colorimetrically to measure the degree of degranulation. Dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) sensitized BALB/c mice were administrated orally with 1 or 0.1mg GlcN-HCl or GlcNAc for 6 days. One hour after the final administration, mice were challenged by DNFB to induce ear swelling. KEY FINDINGS: GlcN-HCl significantly inhibited the antigen-induced degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells at higher than 0.01 mg/mL for 24h-treatment while GlcNAc, a chitin oligomer and a chitosan oligomer had no effect. GlcN-HCl also suppressed intracellular calcium mobilization. GlcN-HCl and GlcNAc significantly suppressed the antigen-induced up-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA. Ear swelling and histamine levels of plasma and ear in DNFB-treated mice were significantly suppressed by oral administration of GlcN-HCl or GlcNAc (0.1 and 1mg) for 6 days. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly suggest that GlcN-HCl and GlcNAc have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo by suppressing the activation of mast cells.","['Sakai, Shota', 'Sugawara, Tatsuya', 'Kishi, Toshihiro', 'Yanagimoto, Kenichi', 'Hirata, Takashi']","['Sakai S', 'Sugawara T', 'Kishi T', 'Yanagimoto K', 'Hirata T']","['Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['D241E059U6 (Dinitrofluorobenzene)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dinitrofluorobenzene/*toxicity', '*Ear', 'Edema/chemically induced/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Female', 'Glucosamine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rats']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2009/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(10)00019-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2010.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2010 Feb 27;86(9-10):337-43. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2010.01.001.

Here, we analyzed 10 HLA-A2 positive patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for loss or mutations of the WT1 epitope or epitope flanking sequences that may abolish proper T cell recognition or epitope presentation. METHODS: All patients had been enrolled in a WT1 peptide phase II vaccination trial (NCT00153582) and ultimately progressed despite induction of a WT1 specific T cell response. Blood and bone marrow samples prior to vaccination and during progression were analyzed for mRNA expression level of WT1. Base exchanges within the epitope sequence or flanking regions (10 amino acids N- and C-terminal of the epitope) were assessed with melting point analysis and sequencing. HLA class I expression and WT1 protein expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Only in one patient, downregulation of WT1 mRNA by 1 log and loss of WT1 detection on protein level at time of disease progression was observed. No mutation leading to a base exchange within the epitope sequence or epitope flanking sequences could be detected in any patient. Further, no loss of HLA class I expression on leukemic blasts was observed. CONCLUSION: Defects in antigen presentation caused by loss or mutation of WT1 or downregulation of HLA molecules are not the major basis for escape from the immune response induced by WT1 peptide vaccination.","['Busse, Antonia', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Scheibenbogen, Carmen', 'Nonnenmacher, Anika', 'Ochsenreither, Sebastian', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Keilholz, Ulrich']","['Busse A', 'Letsch A', 'Scheibenbogen C', 'Nonnenmacher A', 'Ochsenreither S', 'Thiel E', 'Keilholz U']","['Charite - CBF, Department of Medicine III, Berlin, Germany. antonia.busse@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Epitopes', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Tumor Escape/genetics/immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/immunology', '*Wilms Tumor/genetics/immunology']",2010/01/23 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/01/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-8-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-8-5 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2010 Jan 21;8:5. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-8-5.,10.1186/1479-5876-8-5 [doi],20100121,,,,,PMC2844374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of Aurora kinases results in suppression of cell division, phosphorylation of histone H3 and induction of apoptosis in many cell types. These characteristics have prompted the testing of Aurora kinase inhibitors as chemotherapeutic agents. In our study, we report the in vitro activities of AZD1152, a selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), -infected T-cell lines. Overexpression of Aurora B was noted in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines compared to HTLV-1-uninfected T-cell lines. AZD1152 reduced the viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines within 24 hr but did not affect that of -uninfected T-cell lines. Although AZD1152 inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10 in both HTLV-1-infected and -uninfected T-cell lines, it induced polyploidy only in HTLV-1-uninfected T-cell lines. AZD1152 induced early apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cells without induction of polyploidy. We have reported previously that a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling activity in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. In contrast, AZD1152 did not affect NF-kappaB activity in these cells. It induced p53 and p21 expression in HTLV-1-infected but not in HTLV-1-uninfected T-cell lines, suggesting that activation of p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint might prevent polyploidy in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Our results suggest that specific inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ATL and that further in vivo exploration is warranted.","['Tomita, Mariko', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Tomita M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0', '(2-((3-((4-((5-(2-((3-fluorophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)quina', 'zolin-7-yl)oxy)propyl)(ethyl)amino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphate)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/physiology', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*virology', 'Transfection']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25178 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Oct 1;127(7):1584-94. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25178.,10.1002/ijc.25178 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,['Int J Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;129(11):2762-3.

Application of the factors activates astrocytes in vivo and in vitro, and their expression as well as their receptors is upregulated after brain injury. Here, we investigated their function by studying Muller cell activation induced by optic nerve crush in CNTF- and LIF-deficient mice, and in animals with deficiencies in cytokine signaling pathways. In the retina of CNTF(-/-) mice, basal GFAP expression was reduced, but unexpectedly, injury-induced upregulation in activated Muller cells was increased during the first 3 days after lesion as compared to wild-type animals and this corresponded with higher phosphorylation level of STAT3, an indicator of cytokine signaling. The observation that LIF expression was strongly upregulated in CNTF(-/-) mice but not in wild-type animals following optic nerve lesion provided a possible explanation. In fact, additional ablation of the LIF gene in CNTF/LIF double knockout mice almost completely abolished early lesion-induced GFAP upregulation in Muller cells and STAT3 phosphorylation. Early Muller cell activation was also eliminated in LIF(-/-) mice, despite normal CNTF levels, as well as in mutants deficient in gp130/JAK/STAT signaling and in conditional STAT3 knockout mice. Our results demonstrate that LIF signaling via the gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway is required for the initiation of the astrogliosis-like reaction of retinal Muller cells after optic nerve injury. A potential role of CNTF was possibly masked by a compensatory increase in LIF signaling in the absence of CNTF.","['Kirsch, Matthias', 'Trautmann, Nikolaus', 'Ernst, Matthias', 'Hofmann, Hans-Dieter']","['Kirsch M', 'Trautmann N', 'Ernst M', 'Hofmann HD']","['Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Freiburg, Albertstr. 23, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Gliosis/etiology/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Optic Nerve/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Optic Nerve Injuries/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Retina/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.20961 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2010 May;58(7):768-79. doi: 10.1002/glia.20961.,10.1002/glia.20961 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This death process is mediated, in part, by the mitochondrial signaling pathway involving Bcl-2 family proteins. Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-l) is an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Its involvement in noise-induced hair cell death has not been characterized. Here we report the endogenous expression and the noise-induced expression of Mcl-1 in Sprague Dawley rat cochleae. In the sensory epithelia of normal cochleae, there is strong constitutive expression of Mcl-1 mRNA, with an expression level higher than that of many other Bcl-2 family genes. The Mcl-1 protein is preferentially expressed in outer hair cells. After exposure to a high level of continuous noise at 115-dB sound pressure level for 1 hr, Mcl-1 expression displays a time-dependent alteration, with up-regulation of Mcl-1 mRNA at 4 hr postexposure and protein up-regulation at 1 day postexposure. Western blot analysis reveals the up-regulated Mcl-1 as the full-length form of Mcl-1. Immunolabeling of the Mcl-1 protein reveals the early increase in Mcl-1 immunoreactivity in the nuclear region of the hair cells displaying apoptotic phenotypes and a subsequent increase in survival hair cells. These results suggest that Mcl-1 is involved in the regulation of hair cell pathogenesis resulting from acoustic stress, possibly by influencing the nuclear events of apoptosis.","['Hu, Bo Hua', 'Cai, Qunfeng']","['Hu BH', 'Cai Q']","['Center for Hearing and Deafness, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14214, USA. bhu@buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Acoustic Stimulation/*methods', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cochlea/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Noise/adverse effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Psychoacoustics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.22333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2010 Jun;88(8):1812-21. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22333.,10.1002/jnr.22333 [doi],,,,,['R01 DC010154/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3521497,,,['NIHMS410934'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia were eligible. A phase I 3+3 design was implemented. Pemetrexed was infused intravenously (IV) over 25 min with vitamin supplementation. Courses were repeated every 3 to 4 weeks according to toxicity and efficacy. The starting dose of 900 mg/m(2) was escalated by approximately 33% until the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was determined. RESULTS: Twenty patients with acute myeloid (AML) or lymphocytic (ALL) leukemia received therapy. The main non-hematologic adverse event was liver dysfunction at several dose levels, including 2 DLTs at 3,600 mg/m(2). One patient with ALL (3,600 mg/m(2) dose level) achieved a partial response. Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were linear with escalated dosing. Elevated plasma deoxyuridine was observed in a subset of patients following pemetrexed infusion, but was not correlated with dose levels. Changes in the nucleotide pools of circulating mononuclear cells were observed, but were variable. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose of pemetrexed for future leukemia studies is 2,700 mg/m(2) IV over 25 min every 3 to 4 weeks with vitamin supplementation. Deoxyuridine levels did not increase with increasing pemetrexed dose, suggesting pemetrexed inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) may be saturated by the 900 mg/m(2) dose level. However, no firm conclusion can be made regarding TS saturation in tumor cells. While tolerable, pemetrexed monotherapy had limited activity in this highly refractory population. Exploration of pemetrexed in combination with other active agents in leukemia is a reasonable future endeavor.","['Abdel-Karim, Isam', 'Plunkett, William K Jr', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Du, Min', 'Schneck, Karen B', 'Chen, Victor J', 'Lin, Boris K', 'Nicol, Steven J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Abdel-Karim I', 'Plunkett WK Jr', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Thomas D', 'Faderl S', 'Ravandi F', 'Rios MB', 'Du M', 'Schneck KB', 'Chen VJ', 'Lin BK', 'Nicol SJ', 'Kantarjian HM']","['San Antonio Cancer Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glutamates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Guanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Pemetrexed', 'Recurrence']",2010/01/22 06:00,2011/05/28 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-009-9369-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2011 Apr;29(2):323-31. doi: 10.1007/s10637-009-9369-7.

In early clinical trials, immunotoxins constructed with domains II and III of Pseudomonas exotoxin (termed PE38), have produced a high rate of complete remissions in Hairy Cell Leukemia and objective responses in other malignancies. Cholera exotoxin (also known as cholix toxin) has a very similar three-dimensional structure to Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) and when domains II and III of each are compared at the primary sequence level, they are 36% identical and 50% similar. Here we report on the construction and activity of an immunotoxin made with domains II and III of cholera exotoxin (here termed CET40). In cell viability assays, the CET40 immunotoxin was equipotent to tenfold less active compared to a PE-based immunotoxin made with the same single-chain Fv. A major limitation of toxin-based immunotoxins is the development of neutralizing antibodies to the toxin portion of the immunotoxin. Because of structure and sequence similarities, we evaluated a CET40 immunotoxin for the presence of PE-related epitopes. In western blots, three-of-three anti-PE antibody preparations failed to react with the CET40 immunotoxin. More importantly, in neutralization studies neither these antibodies nor those from patients with neutralizing titers to PE38, neutralized the CET40-immunotoxin. We propose that the use of modular components such as antibody Fvs and toxin domains will allow a greater flexibility in how these agents are designed and deployed including the sequential administration of a second immunotoxin after patients have developed neutralizing antibodies to the first.","['Sarnovsky, Robert', 'Tendler, Tara', 'Makowski, Matheusz', 'Kiley, Maureen', 'Antignani, Antonella', 'Traini, Roberta', 'Zhang, Jingli', 'Hassan, Raffit', 'FitzGerald, David J']","['Sarnovsky R', 'Tendler T', 'Makowski M', 'Kiley M', 'Antignani A', 'Traini R', 'Zhang J', 'Hassan R', 'FitzGerald DJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CCR, NCI, NIH, HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cholera Toxin/genetics/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Exotoxins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/blood/immunology', 'Pseudomonas/immunology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0794-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 May;59(5):737-46. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0794-4.

Since Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) controls transcription of Hsp70, we wanted to probe the signaling pathways responsible for transcriptional activation of HSF1. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cells exposed to 40microM Resveratrol rapidly abolished serine473 phosphorylation of Akt and significantly reduced its kinase activity. Inactivation of Akt pathway by Resveratrol subsequently blocked serine9 phosphorylation of Gsk3beta. Active non-phosphorylated Gsk3beta rendered HSF1 transcriptionally inactive and reduced Hsp70 production. Blocking PI3K/Akt activity also demonstrated similar effects on Hsp70 comparable to Resveratrol. Inactivation of Gsk3beta activity by inhibitors SB261763 or LiCl upregulated Hsp70. Resveratrol significantly modulated ERK1/2 activity as evident from hyper phosphorylation at T302/Y304 residues and simultaneous upregulation in kinase activity. Blocking ERK1/2 activation resulted in induction of Hsp70. Therefore, increase in ERK1/2 activity by Resveratrol provided another negative influence on Hsp70 levels through negative regulation of HSF1 activity. 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), a drug that inhibits Hsp90 chaperone and degrades its client protein Akt concomitantly elevated Hsp70 levels by promoting nuclear translocation of HSF1 from the cytosol. This effect is predominantly due to inhibition of both Akt and ERK1/2 activation by 17AAG. Simultaneously treating K562 with Resveratrol and 17AAG maintained phosho-ERK1/2 levels close to untreated controls demonstrating their opposite effects on ERK1/2 pathway. Resveratrol was found not to interfere with Bcr-Abl activation in K562 cells. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus our study comprehensively illustrates that Resveratrol acts downstream of Bcr-Abl and inhibits Akt activity but stimulates ERK1/2 activity. This brings down the transcriptional activity of HSF1 and Hsp70 production in K562 cells. Additionally, Resveratrol can be used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as 17AAG, an Hsp90 inhibitor reported to induce Hsp70 and hence compromise its chemotherapeutic potential.","['Banerjee Mustafi, Soumyajit', 'Chakraborty, Prabir K', 'Raha, Sanghamitra']","['Banerjee Mustafi S', 'Chakraborty PK', 'Raha S']","['Crystallography and Molecular Biology Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008719 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jan 14;5(1):e8719. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008719.,10.1371/journal.pone.0008719 [doi],20100114,,,,,PMC2806839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in metabolic profiles between unmutated (UM-IGHV; n=10) and mutated IGHV (M-IGHV; n=19) patients were determined using partial least square discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA; R(2)=0.74, Q(2)=0.36). The UM-IGHV patients had elevated levels of cholesterol, lactate, uridine and fumarate, and decreased levels of pyridoxine, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and methionine concentrations. The PLS-DA models derived from ZAP70 classifications showed comparatively poor goodness-of-fit values, suggesting that IGHV mutational status correlates better with disease-related metabolic profiles. Our results highlight the usefulness of (1)H-NMR-based metabolomics as a potential non-invasive prognostic tool for identifying CLL disease-state biomarkers.","['MacIntyre, D A', 'Jimenez, B', 'Lewintre, E Jantus', 'Martin, C Reinoso', 'Schafer, H', 'Ballesteros, C Garcia', 'Mayans, J Ramon', 'Spraul, M', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Pineda-Lucena, A']","['MacIntyre DA', 'Jimenez B', 'Lewintre EJ', 'Martin CR', 'Schafer H', 'Ballesteros CG', 'Mayans JR', 'Spraul M', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Pineda-Lucena A']","['Structural Biology Laboratory, Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/classification/genetics', '*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', '*Metabolome', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009295 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.295 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):788-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.295.

Clearly, pancreatic cancer requires new therapeutic concepts. Recently, the kinase inhibitors imatinib and gefitinib, developed to treat chronic myelogenous leukaemia and breast cancer, respectively, gave very good results. Kinases are deregulated in many diseases, including cancer. Given that phosphorylation controls cell survival signalling, strategies targeting kinases should obviously improve cancer treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarize the present knowledge on kinases potentially usable as therapeutic targets in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. All clinical trials using available kinase inhibitors in monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs failed to improve survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. To detect kinases relevant to this disease, we undertook a systematic screening of the human kinome to define a 'survival kinase' catalogue for pancreatic cells. We selected 56 kinases that are potential therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer. Preclinical studies using combined inhibition of PAK7, MAP3K7 and CK2 survival kinases in vitro and in vivo showed a cumulative effect on apoptosis induction. We also observed that these three kinases are rather specific of pancreatic cancer cells. In conclusion, if kinase inhibitors presently available are unfortunately not efficient for treating pancreatic cancer, recent data suggest that inhibitors of other kinases, involved more specifically in pancreatic cancer development, might, in the future, become interesting therapeutic targets.","['Giroux, Valentin', 'Dagorn, Jean-Charles', 'Iovanna, Juan L']","['Giroux V', 'Dagorn JC', 'Iovanna JL']","['INSERM U624, Stress Cellulaire, Parc Scientifique et Technologique de Luminy, Marseille Cedex 9, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Pancreatology,Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

There is paucity of data pertaining to EBV association with various cancers in India . OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the association of EBV in childhood leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients attending pediatric oncology services of the referral center have been included in the study. Twenty-five consecutive pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic lukemia (ALL) were subjected to EBV studies employing sensitive polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization for presence of Bam H1-W region of EBV genome and detection of anti Z EBV replication activator (ZEBRA) antibodies using Western blot. Positive control included a case of Burkitt's lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis each. Raji cells were used as positive control with each test. RESULTS: The PCR for EBV was positive in 8/25 patients of ALL. Western blot test using anti ZEBRA antibodies was positive in 5/25(20%) cases of ALL. Considering PCR as the gold standard, 32% of the children with ALL had evidence of active EBV replication. The positive controls were consistently positive. None of the 30 healthy laboratory controls, 22 age matched disease controls, 12 cases of AML and 15 cases of multiple myeloma were positive either by PCR or Western blots assays (P < 0. 01). There was no statistically significant correlation between duration of therapy and EBV positivity (P > 0.05).

A CD20 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on B-cell lines cDNA yielded a short PCR product (DeltaCD20) corresponding to a spliced mRNA transcript linking the exon 3 and exon 7 ends. We established here that this novel, alternatively spliced CD20 transcript is expressed and detectable at various levels in leukemic B cells, lymphoma B cells, in vivo tonsil- or in vitro CD40L-activated B cells, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells, but not in resting CD19(+)- or CD20(+)-sorted B cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow of healthy donors.

Recent studies identified microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as a major downstream target of p53. We monitored the expression of miR-34a during disease development in a murine B-CLL model. miR-34a was up-regulated more than 20-fold during the leukemic but not during the preleukemic phase. In the human system, B-CLL cells also had 4.6-fold higher miR-34a expression compared with B cells of healthy controls. In B-CLL cells of patients with p53 aberrations, miR-34a expression was consistently low. The broad distribution of miR-34a levels in p53 wild-type patients prompted us to study the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphism 309 (SNP309) in the intronic promoter of MDM2 and miR-34a expression. B-CLL cells of patients with the SNP309 GG genotype had significantly lower miR-34a expression levels compared with patients with the TT genotype (P = .002). Low miR-34a levels were able to predict shorter time to treatment (P = .003) and were associated with an abbreviated lymphocyte doubling time. Further, overexpression of miR-34a in primary B-CLL cells induced apoptosis. These findings suggest miR-34a as a possible therapeutic avenue and a sensitive indicator of the activity of the p53 axis in B-CLL.","['Asslaber, Daniela', 'Pinon, Josefina D', 'Seyfried, Irina', 'Desch, Petra', 'Stocher, Markus', 'Tinhofer, Inge', 'Egle, Alexander', 'Merkel, Olaf', 'Greil, Richard']","['Asslaber D', 'Pinon JD', 'Seyfried I', 'Desch P', 'Stocher M', 'Tinhofer I', 'Egle A', 'Merkel O', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34972-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-234823 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 May 27;115(21):4191-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-234823.

Using informative coding single nucleotide polymorphisms, we found DLK1 expression to be monoallelic in normal bone marrow, whereas it was biallelic in 76% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) overexpressing DLK1 (61% of all AML). Quantitative methylation analysis of 7 cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-rich areas (3 upstream of or within DLK1, the putative intergenic-differentially methylated region and 3 upstream of or within MEG3) revealed a strong association between biallelic DLK1 expression and hypermethylation of a cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-rich region 18 kb upstream of DLK1. Allele-specific methylation analysis of this region revealed the alleles to be differentially methylated in normal bone marrow and monoallelic DLK1 AML, whereas there was increased methylation of both alleles in AML with biallelic expression. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that CCTC-binding factor binds to this region in monoallelic but not biallelic expression samples. Taken together, our data indicate that an insulator located 18 kb upstream of DLK1 plays an important role in regulating DLK1 imprinting.","['Khoury, Haytham', 'Suarez-Saiz, Fernando', 'Wu, Samantha', 'Minden, Mark D']","['Khoury H', 'Suarez-Saiz F', 'Wu S', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLK1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genomic Imprinting/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulator Elements/*genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56636-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-212746 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 18;115(11):2260-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-212746.

Prior to entry, the binding of virus particles to specific cell surface receptors can trigger virus surfing, an actin-dependent lateral transport of viruses toward the cell body (M. J. Lehmann et al., J. Cell Biol. 170:317-325, 2005; M. Schelhaas, et al., PLoS Pathog. 4:e1000148, 2008; J. L. Smith, D. S. Lidke, and M. A. Ozbun, Virology 381:16-21, 2008). Here, we have used live-cell imaging to demonstrate that for cells chronically infected with the gammaretrovirus murine leukemia virus in which receptor has been downregulated, a significant portion of completely assembled virus particles are not immediately released into the supernatant but retain long-term association with the cell surface. Retention can be attributed, at least in part, to nonspecific particle attachment to cell surface glycosylaminoglycans. In contrast to virus surfing, viruses retained at the surface of infected cells undergo a lateral motility that is random and actin independent. This diffusive motility can be abruptly halted and converted into inward surfing after treatment with Polybrene, a soluble cation that increases virus-cell adsorption. In the absence of Polybrene, particle diffusion allows for an outward flow of viruses to the infected cell periphery. Peripheral particles are readily captured by and transmitted to neighboring uninfected target cells in a directional fashion. These data demonstrate a surface-based mechanism for the directional spread of viruses regulated by differential virus-cell interactions.","['Sherer, Nathan M', 'Jin, Jing', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Sherer NM', 'Jin J', 'Mothes W']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London School of Medicine, 2nd floor, Borough Wing, Guy's Hospital, London Bridge, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom. nathan.sherer@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '4C905MSK4W (Hexadimethrine Bromide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*virology', 'Glycosaminoglycans/physiology', 'Hexadimethrine Bromide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Virion/physiology', 'Virus Assembly']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02155-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02155-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Apr;84(7):3248-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02155-09.

Effective immune detection largely relies on the formation of an immune synapse which requires close contact between immune cells and their targets. Here, we show that MUC16, a heavily glycosylated 3-5 million Da mucin expressed on the surface of ovarian tumor cells, inhibits the formation of immune synapses between NK cells and ovarian tumor targets. Our results indicate that MUC16-mediated inhibition of immune synapse formation is an effective mechanism employed by ovarian tumors to evade immune recognition. RESULTS: Expression of low levels of MUC16 strongly correlated with an increased number of conjugates and activating immune synapses between ovarian tumor cells and primary naive NK cells. MUC16-knockdown ovarian tumor cells were more susceptible to lysis by primary NK cells than MUC16 expressing controls. This increased lysis was not due to differences in the expression levels of the ligands for the activating receptors DNAM-1 and NKG2D. The NK cell leukemia cell line (NKL), which does not express KIRs but are positive for DNAM-1 and NKG2D, also conjugated and lysed MUC16-knockdown cells more efficiently than MUC16 expressing controls. Tumor cells that survived the NKL challenge expressed higher levels of MUC16 indicating selective lysis of MUC16(low) targets. The higher csMUC16 levels on the NKL resistant tumor cells correlated with more protection from lysis as compared to target cells that were never exposed to the effectors. CONCLUSION: MUC16, a carrier of the tumor marker CA125, has previously been shown to facilitate ovarian tumor metastasis and inhibits NK cell mediated lysis of tumor targets. Our data now demonstrates that MUC16 expressing ovarian cancer cells are protected from recognition by NK cells. The immune protection provided by MUC16 may lead to selective survival of ovarian cancer cells that are more efficient in metastasizing within the peritoneal cavity and also at overcoming anti-tumor innate immune responses.","['Gubbels, Jennifer A A', 'Felder, Mildred', 'Horibata, Sachi', 'Belisle, Jennifer A', 'Kapur, Arvinder', 'Holden, Helen', 'Petrie, Sarah', 'Migneault, Martine', 'Rancourt, Claudine', 'Connor, Joseph P', 'Patankar, Manish S']","['Gubbels JA', 'Felder M', 'Horibata S', 'Belisle JA', 'Kapur A', 'Holden H', 'Petrie S', 'Migneault M', 'Rancourt C', 'Connor JP', 'Patankar MS']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CA-125 Antigen)', '0 (CD226 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MUC16 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'CA-125 Antigen/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoprotection/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2009/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-11 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jan 20;9:11. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-11.,10.1186/1476-4598-9-11 [doi],20100120,,,,['CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2818693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TK is also essential in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate HPA axis in patients treated with imatinib. Twenty-five patients were included in this study. METHODS: Glucagon stimulation test (GST) and low-dose (1 microg) adrenocorticotropin test (LDSST) were used to assess the HPA gland axis. RESULTS: Seventeen (68%) subjects had impaired peak response when a cortisol cut-off value is accepted as 500 nmol/L. Twelve (48%) out of 17 subjects also failed to show a response to LDSST. Therefore, 12 patients (48%) were defined as HPA deficient. Only two of these 25 patients had morning serum cortisol < 200 nmol/l (7.22 microg/dl), and failed the GST and/or LDSST, indicating that the majority had partial glucocorticoid deficiency. If the cut-off presume for LDSST is from 500 to 600 nmol/l, 16 patients (64%) would have failed both the GST and LDSST. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate an increased prevalence of subclinical glucocorticoid deficiency in patients receiving imatinib mesylate for CML. Therefore under stressed conditions, such as intercurrent illness state, overt and untreated partial glucocorticoid deficiency in CML patients become life threatening.","['Bilgir, O', 'Kebapcilar, L', 'Bilgir, F', 'Sari, I', 'Oner, P', 'Karaca, B', 'Alacacioglu, I']","['Bilgir O', 'Kebapcilar L', 'Bilgir F', 'Sari I', 'Oner P', 'Karaca B', 'Alacacioglu I']","['Internal Medicine Department, Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '16960-16-0 (Cosyntropin)', '53468-06-7 (adrenocorticotropin zinc)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9007-92-5 (Glucagon)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cosyntropin', 'Endocrine System Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glucagon', 'Glucocorticoids/deficiency', 'Hormones', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/metabolism', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects']",2010/01/22 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['IJCP1856 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01856.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2010 Jan;64(1):45-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01856.x.,10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01856.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytogenetics (CC) cannot accurately define the specific alterations in CCA. Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) allows the comprehensive identification of CCA. In this study, M-FISH was used in 16 patients with de novo MDS and 22 with AML with CCA detected by R-banding CC, and revealed 206 aberrations involved all 24 chromosomes, including 73 numerical chromosomal abnormalities and 133 structural abnormalities. The chromosomes most often involved were, by decreasing incidence, 5, 17, 8, 11, 7 and 21 in 57.9%, 55.3%, 44.7%, 36.8%, 34.2% and 34.2% of the cases, respectively. There were 98 unbalanced translocations, which were the most frequently observed aberrations in our study. Derivative chromosome 5 and 8 were implicated most often. The other derivatives were der(11), der(12), der(7), der(14), der(15) and der(17). Fourteen balanced translocations were detected in our series, and the most frequent reciprocal translocations was t(8;21). Fifty-five monosomies, 15 partial deletions, and 18 trisomies were found in all patients. The most frequently observed were -5/5q-, -17/17q-, -7, -18, -21, -19, and trisomy of chromosome 8 and 6. There were some abnormalities that have not been previously described, including two complex t(8;21) and seven unbalanced translocations. M-FISH could refine CCA, find or correct the missed or misidentified aberrations by CC analysis. Our findings confirmed that M-FISH was a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool to characterize complex karyotypes in MDS and AML.","['Xu, W', 'Li, J-Y', 'Liu, Q', 'Zhu, Y', 'Pan, J-L', 'Qiu, H-R', 'Xue, Y-Q']","['Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Liu Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Pan JL', 'Qiu HR', 'Xue YQ']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1101 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01101.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Feb;32(1 Pt 1):e86-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01101.x.

The effect of dexamethasone on the immunomodulatory activities of lenalidomide such as T cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation was measured via interleukin [IL]-2 production, and interferon-gamma and granzyme B production respectively. Lenalidomide inhibited proliferation in most cell lines tested, and this effect was enhanced by dexamethasone. This effect was observed in MM cells containing the high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities t(4;14), t(14;16), del17p, del13, and hypodiploidy. Mechanistically, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone synergistically induced expression of the tumor suppressor genes Egr1, Egr2, Egr3, p15, p21, and p27 in MM cell lines and MM patient cells. The combination activated caspases 3, 8, and 9; and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Lenalidomide alone increased T cell production of IL-2, and NK cell production of interferon-gamma and granzyme B. Notably, dexamethasone antagonized these immunostimulatory effects of lenalidomide in a dose-dependent manner. These data further elucidate the mechanism of action of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in MM, and suggest that use of low-dose dexamethasone with lenalidomide may retain the antiproliferative effect of lenalidomide while permitting greater immunomodulatory effects of this combination regimen.","['Gandhi, A K', 'Kang, J', 'Capone, L', 'Parton, A', 'Wu, L', 'Zhang, L H', 'Mendy, D', 'Lopez-Girona, A', 'Tran, T', 'Sapinoso, L', 'Fang, W', 'Xu, S', 'Hampton, G', 'Bartlett, J B', 'Schafer, P']","['Gandhi AK', 'Kang J', 'Capone L', 'Parton A', 'Wu L', 'Zhang LH', 'Mendy D', 'Lopez-Girona A', 'Tran T', 'Sapinoso L', 'Fang W', 'Xu S', 'Hampton G', 'Bartlett JB', 'Schafer P']","['Celgene Corporation, Summit, New Jersey, USA, San Diego, California, USA. agandhi@celgene.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2010/01/22 06:00,2010/07/23 06:00,['2010/01/22 06:00'],"['2009/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['EPub-Abstract-CCDT-04 [pii]', '10.2174/156800910791054239 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2010 Mar;10(2):155-67. doi: 10.2174/156800910791054239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to bypass P-gp, thus overcoming MDR, a hybrid peptide comprising a cell penetrating peptide (Tat) and a drug binding motif (DBM) has been developed to noncovalently bind and deliver doxorubicin (Dox) into MDR cells. The uptake of Dox into the leukemia cell line K562 and its P-gp overexpressing subline KD30 increased in the presence of DBM-Tat peptide. Confocal microscopy indicated that DBM-Tat associated Dox was directed to a perinuclear area of KD30 cells, while this was not observed in parent K562 cells. When KD30 cells were pretreated with the endosomotropic agent chloroquine (CLQ), peptide associated Dox redistributed into the cytosol, indicating that endocytosis was the predominant uptake route. Altered drug uptake kinetics observed by cellular accumulation assay also supported an endocytic uptake. In the presence of CLQ, DBM-Tat was able to enhance the cytotoxicity of Dox by 68.4% at 5 microM peptide concentration in KD30 cells but there were only minor effects on Dox cytotoxicity in K562 cells even in the presence of CLQ.

Herein, we demonstrate that a novel small molecule fluacrypyrim (FAPM) inhibits the growth of leukemia cells by a predominant G1 arrest with significant decrease of the protein and mRNA levels of cyclin D1. As cyclin D1 is transcriptionally regulated by STAT3, FAPM is then shown to markedly inhibit the STAT3 phosphorylation with marginal effect on the other signal transducers and activators of transcription, and without effect on phosphoinositide-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Further analysis shows that FAPM significantly increases the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) activity in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition of PTP activation by sodium pervanadate reverses FAPM-induced suppression of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating an important role of PTP in the action of FAPM. Finally, FAPM treatment results in selective suppression of STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity and its downstream effectors, and subsequent induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in STAT3-dependent cancer cell lines. This study therefore identifies FAPM as a potent STAT3 activation inhibitor with possible therapeutic potential against malignancies with constitutive STAT3 activation.","['Yu, Zu-Yin', 'Huang, Rui', 'Xiao, He', 'Sun, Wen-Feng', 'Shan, Ya-Jun', 'Wang, Bo', 'Zhao, Ting-Ting', 'Dong, Bo', 'Zhao, Zhen-Hu', 'Liu, Xiao-Lan', 'Wang, Sheng-Qi', 'Yang, Ri-Fang', 'Luo, Qing-Liang', 'Cong, Yu-Wen']","['Yu ZY', 'Huang R', 'Xiao H', 'Sun WF', 'Shan YJ', 'Wang B', 'Zhao TT', 'Dong B', 'Zhao ZH', 'Liu XL', 'Wang SQ', 'Yang RF', 'Luo QL', 'Cong YW']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'FHJ1L9VJTH (fluacrypyrim)']",IM,"['Acrylates/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25169 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Sep 1;127(6):1259-70. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25169.,10.1002/ijc.25169 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the leukemia relapses, allogenic hematopoietic stem transplantation (allo-HSCT) is considered as a treatment option. Since the efficacy of reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) for AML with favorable cytogenetics has not been established, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of allo-HSCT in AML patients according to cytogenetic risks. The outcome of allo-HSCT for AML patients with favorable cytogenetics seemed to be superior to that for AML patients with intermediate cytogenetics. In AML patients with favorable cytogenetics, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 88 and 76%, respectively, in the RIST group. Both the 3-year OS and RFS rates were 81% in the conventional stem cell transplantation (CST) group. The outcome of RIST for AML patients with favorable cytogenetics was comparable to that for patients who received CST despite the more advanced age and greater organ dysfunction in RIST group than in CST group. None of the patients died within 90 days after RIST. Moreover, there was no relapse in patients with favorable cytogenetics who were in hematological remission prior to RIST. Thus, RIST for AML patients with favorable cytogenetics in remission is safe and effective.","['Kondo, Takeshi', 'Yasumoto, Atsushi', 'Arita, Kotaro', 'Sugita, Jun-Ichi', 'Shigematsu, Akio', 'Okada, Kohei', 'Takahata, Mutsumi', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Kahata, Kaoru', 'Takeda, Yukari', 'Obara, Masato', 'Yamamoto, Satoshi', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Nishio, Mitsufumi', 'Sato, Norihiro', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Hashino, Satoshi', 'Koike, Takao', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Imamura, Masahiro']","['Kondo T', 'Yasumoto A', 'Arita K', 'Sugita J', 'Shigematsu A', 'Okada K', 'Takahata M', 'Onozawa M', 'Kahata K', 'Takeda Y', 'Obara M', 'Yamamoto S', 'Endo T', 'Nishio M', 'Sato N', 'Tanaka J', 'Hashino S', 'Koike T', 'Asaka M', 'Imamura M']","['Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo 060-8648, Japan. t-kondoh@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2009/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-009-0487-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Mar;91(2):310-21. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0487-y.

Dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of SRC as well as other tyrosine kinases. The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of second-line dasatinib in patients with chemosensitive (relapse or progression > or =90 days after completing first-line therapy) small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Patients with measurable disease; performance status 0 to 1; no more than one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen; and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function were eligible. Dasatinib was administered orally at 70 mg twice daily continuously (1 cycle = 21 days) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response was determined after every two cycles. Patients were followed until disease progression or death. The study was prospectively designed to simultaneously discriminate between complete plus partial response rates of 5% versus 20% and progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 6 weeks of 50% versus 70.7% in 53 evaluable patients with at least 92% power. The study was to be terminated early and declared negative if 1 or less objective response and 14 or fewer instances of PFS > or =6 weeks were observed among the initial 27 patients; however, patient accrual continued while the initial 27 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Between April 2007 and December 2008, 45 patients were enrolled, but one patient never received any protocol therapy and one patient was ineligible: male/female, 17/26; white/black/unknown, 40/2/1; median age, 64 years (range, 35-84 years); and performance status 0/1, 12/31. No objective response was recorded among the 43 eligible and treated patients. Among the initial 27 patients, only 13 instances of PFS > or =6 weeks were observed. With a median follow-up time of 7.1 months, median estimated overall survival and PFS times for the 43 eligible and treated patients were 17.0 and 5.9 weeks, respectively. Common reasons for removal of patients from protocol treatment were progressive disease (65%) and adverse events (26%). Toxicity was generally mild to moderate: grade 3 events of >5% frequency included fatigue and pleural and pericardial effusions; and no grade 4 or 5 events were encountered.

The treatment approach for many years has used combination chemotherapy, with usually an anthracycline and cytarabine as the foundation. In the present review we will present new data from recently completed trials that have demonstrated advances in the treatment of AML. RECENT FINDINGS: We will discuss the recent trials that support the importance of dose intensification in younger patients either through increasing dose of the anthracycline, adding other agents such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, or through 'timed sequential' therapy. We will promote the importance of treating the older AML patient (>60 years old) and the various ways different groups are addressing a different biologically behaving disease and the patient being treated. These methods include dose reduction, dose intensification and new agents with a better toxicity profile. SUMMARY: Due to aggressive induction therapy, patients with AML are having better remission and survival outcomes. New agents that are targeted to specific molecular abnormalities in the AML cell are being studied as additions to induction therapy.","['Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Fernandez HF', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, USA. hugo.fernandez@moffitt.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366b7a [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Mar;17(2):79-84. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366b7a.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366b7a [doi],,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: The prevalence of the JAK2V617F mutation in the classic Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders has made it a much anticipated target for inhibition. Present in greater than 90% of patients with polycythemia vera and approximately 50% of patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, it has been hoped that targeted inhibition of JAK2V617F would achieve similar disease control as imatinib mesylate has produced in chronic myeloid leukemia. However, JAK2V617F in the Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders, unlike bcr/abl tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia, is not a causative but rather a secondary somatic mutation. As the JAK2 inhibitors move into phase III clinical trials, their efficacy and role in therapy is becoming clearer; however, there are still many questions needing answers.","['Chen, Andrew T', 'Prchal, Josef T']","['Chen AT', 'Prchal JT']","['Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366b91 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Mar;17(2):110-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366b91.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366b91 [doi],,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 induced ATL after a long latent period. Previous studies suggested the significance of the tax gene. However, Tax is not expressed in about half of ATL cases by three mechanisms: 1) deletion of 5 long terminal repeat (LTR), 2) DNA methylation of 5 LTR, and 3) genetic changes of the tax gene. We found that the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene coding region and 3 LTR remain intact in all ATL cases. The HBZ gene was expressed in all ATL cases and its expression promoting proliferation of ATL cells. HBZ interacts with various host factors, including c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and p65. Thus, HBZ modulates cellular signal pathways in addition to promoted proliferation. These findings indicate that HBZ is an essential viral gene for oncogenesis by HTLV-1.","['Matsuoka, Masao']",['Matsuoka M'],"['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Reactive lymphoproliferations have polyclonally rearranged Ig/TCR genes, whereas malignant proliferations (leukaemias and lymphomas) show clonal rearrangements. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical benefits of clonality testing with previously evaluated consensus primers in leukaemia patients. The study included peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 67 leukaemia patients (32 B-CLL, 24 B-ALL and 11 T-ALL). Clonality testing was based on PCR amplification of rearranged IgH and TCR genes. During diagnosis, monoclonal pattern was found in all analysed B-CLL and T-ALL samples. Testing in B-ALL patients showed positive results in all bone marrow and one peripheral blood samples. Results of clonality testing in B-CLL patients during follow-up were concordant between peripheral blood and bone marrow. Obtained results corresponded to clinical course in all but one patient. In B-ALL group, results of molecular testing in peripheral blood and bone marrow confirmed remission estimated according to clinical criteria in all except one patient. Before any clinical sign of relapse, monoclonal pattern was found in six/seven patients by bone marrow and in three/seven patients by peripheral blood analysis, respectively. Results of molecular monitoring in T-ALL patients did not confirme clinical evaluation in two patients. Obtained results indicate high accuracy of re-evaluated primers for clonality assessment in ALL and CLL patients at the time of diagnosis. Results of clonality testing in B-ALL patients indicate that bone marrow analysis has higher sensitivity compared to analysis of peripheral blood.","['Cikota, Bojana M', 'Tukic, Ljiljana J', 'Tarabar, Olivera T', 'Stamatovic, Dragana T', 'Elez, Marija N', 'Magic, Zvonko M']","['Cikota BM', 'Tukic LJ', 'Tarabar OT', 'Stamatovic DT', 'Elez MN', 'Magic ZM']","['Institute for Medical Research, Military Medical Academy, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. cbojana@ptt.rs']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Genet,Journal of genetics,2985113R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12041-009-0044-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Genet. 2009 Dec;88(3):309-14. doi: 10.1007/s12041-009-0044-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted this study to advance our understanding of the causes of genomic complexity in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have obtained quantitative measurements of radiation-induced apoptosis and radiation-induced ATM autophosphorylation in purified CLL cells from 158 and 140 patients, respectively, and have used multivariate analysis to identify independent contributions of various biological variables on genomic complexity in CLL. RESULTS: Here, we identify a strong independent effect of radiation resistance on elevated genomic complexity in CLL and describe radiation resistance as a predictor for shortened CLL survival. Furthermore, using multivariate analysis, we identify del17p/p53 aberrations, del11q, del13q14 type II (invariably resulting in Rb loss), and CD38 expression as independent predictors of genomic complexity in CLL, with aberrant p53 as a predictor of approximately 50% of genomic complexity in CLL. Focusing on del11q, we determined that normalized ATM activity was a modest predictor of genomic complexity but was not independent of del11q. Through single nucleotide polymorphism array-based fine mapping of del11q, we identified frequent monoallelic loss of Mre11 and H2AFX in addition to ATM, indicative of compound del11q-resident gene defects in the DNA double-strand break response. CONCLUSIONS: Our quantitative analysis links multiple molecular defects, including for the first time del11q and large 13q14 deletions (type II), to elevated genomic complexity in CLL, thereby suggesting mechanisms for the observed clinical aggressiveness of CLL in patients with unstable genomes.","['Ouillette, Peter', 'Fossum, Samuel', 'Parkin, Brian', 'Ding, Li', 'Bockenstedt, Paula', 'Al-Zoubi, Ammar', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Ouillette P', 'Fossum S', 'Parkin B', 'Ding L', 'Bockenstedt P', 'Al-Zoubi A', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-2534 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2534 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Feb 1;16(3):835-47. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2534.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Ten patients (0.7 to 21 years old) who had completed chemotherapy and were in first complete remission of AML were enrolled on the Pilot Study of Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (NKAML) study. They received cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg on day -7) and fludarabine (25 mg/m(2)/d on days -6 through -2), followed by killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-human leukocyte antigen (KIR-HLA) mismatched NK cells (median, 29 x 10(6)/kg NK cells) and six doses of interleukin-2 (1 million U/m(2)). NK cell chimerism, phenotyping, and functional assays were performed on days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation. Results All patients had transient engraftment for a median of 10 days (range, 2 to 189 days) and a significant expansion of KIR-mismatched NK cells (median, 5,800/mL of blood on day 14). Nonhematologic toxicity was limited, with no graft-versus-host disease. Median length of hospitalization was 2 days. With a median follow-up time of 964 days (range, 569 to 1,162 days), all patients remain in remission. The 2-year event-free survival estimate was 100% (95% CI, 63.1% to 100%). CONCLUSION Low-dose immunosuppression followed by donor-recipient inhibitory KIR-HLA mismatched NK cells is well tolerated by patients and results in successful engraftment. We propose to further investigate the efficacy of KIR-mismatched NK cells in a phase II trial as consolidation therapy to decrease relapse without increasing mortality in children with AML.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Rooney, Barbara', 'Bell, Teresa', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Leung, Wing']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Inaba H', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pounds S', 'Rooney B', 'Bell T', 'Pui CH', 'Leung W']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.24.4590 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.24.4590 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 20;28(6):955-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.24.4590.

While arsenic trioxide (ATO) can induce remissions in 95% of relapsed patients, few studies have addressed the integration of ATO into the primary management of APL. This study examines the efficacy of a single cycle of ATO-based consolidation therapy in a treatment regimen designed to decrease exposure to other cytotoxic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS After induction with ATRA and daunorubicin (DRN), untreated patients with APL received 3 days of cytarabine and DRN followed by 30 doses of ATO beginning on day 8. Molecular remitters received 2 years of risk-based maintenance therapy. Results Forty-one of 45 patients receiving induction therapy achieved remission; four patients died (one before treatment was initiated). Thirty-seven patients received consolidation and maintenance; of these one patient relapsed (CNS) and one died in remission during maintenance therapy (hepatic sickle cell crisis). With a median follow-up of 2.7 years, estimated disease-free survival was 90%; overall survival for all patients was 88%. Despite a total anthracycline dose of only 360 mg/m(2), cardiac ejection fraction decreased by > or = 20% in 20% of patients. CONCLUSION These data, combined with other recent studies using ATO in the primary management of APL, demonstrate the important role that ATO can play in the primary management of this curable disease.

These studies suggest that CHD8 alters HOXA2 gene expression and regulates the recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes.","['Yates, Joel A', 'Menon, Tushar', 'Thompson, Brandi A', 'Bochar, Daniel A']","['Yates JA', 'Menon T', 'Thompson BA', 'Bochar DA']","['The Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (ASH2L protein, human)', '0 (CHD8 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RBBP5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-5793(10)00041-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2010.01.022 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2010 Feb 19;584(4):689-93. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2010.01.022.

Mcl-1 overexpression has been associated with progression in leukemia and some solid tumors including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the regulatory mechanism for Mcl-1 expression in PCa cells remains elusive. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Mcl-1 expression was elevated in PCa specimens with high Gleason grades and further significantly increased in bone metastasis, suggesting a pivotal role of Mcl-1 in PCa metastasis. We further found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a novel regulator of Mcl-1 expression in PCa cells. Inhibition of endogenous Mcl-1 induced apoptosis, indicating that Mcl-1 is an important survival factor in PCa cells. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), the ""co-receptor"" for VEGF165 isoform, was found to be highly expressed in PCa cells, and indispensible in the regulation of Mcl-1. Intriguingly, VEGF165 promoted physical interaction between NRP1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-MET, and facilitated c-MET phosphorylation via a NRP1-dependent mechanism. VEGF165 induction of Mcl-1 may involve rapid activation of Src kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3). Importantly, NRP1 overexpression and c-MET activation were positively associated with progression and bone metastasis in human PCa specimens and xenograft tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that Mcl-1 overexpression is associated with PCa bone metastasis. Activation of VEGF165-NRP1-c-MET signaling could confer PCa cells survival advantages by up-regulating Mcl-1, contributing to PCa progression.","['Zhang, Shumin', 'Zhau, Haiyen E', 'Osunkoya, Adeboye O', 'Iqbal, Shareen', 'Yang, Xiaojian', 'Fan, Songqing', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Wang, Ruoxiang', 'Marshall, Fray F', 'Chung, Leland W K', 'Wu, Daqing']","['Zhang S', 'Zhau HE', 'Osunkoya AO', 'Iqbal S', 'Yang X', 'Fan S', 'Chen Z', 'Wang R', 'Marshall FF', 'Chung LW', 'Wu D']","['Department of Urology and Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA. szhang5@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/genetics/secondary', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neuropilin-1/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-9 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jan 19;9:9. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-9.,10.1186/1476-4598-9-9 [doi],20100119,,,,"['R01 CA122602/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R43CA141870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA98912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2820018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors abstracted study results and confounder information from cohort and case-control studies, and used quantile plots and regression models to evaluate heterogeneity and possible publication bias. No evidence of serious heterogeneity or publication bias was seen. For leukemias, the summary relative risk (RR) was 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 1.20) for cohort studies, and the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.37) for case-control studies. Based on cohort and case-control studies, no significant differences were seen by leukemia subtype, job type, publication period, or region. Summary estimates for nasopharyngeal cancers were not elevated after excluding a single plant with an unexplained cluster of nasopharyngeal cancers (cohort RR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.40, 1.28). The summary estimate was increased for case-control studies overall, but the summary OR for smoking-adjusted studies was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.50). Previous meta-analyses showed elevated summary estimates for leukemia; however, these analyses included results from proportionate mortality studies and did not explore other factors that could influence or confound results. By limiting analyses to stronger case-control and cohort study designs, considering the effects of smoking and ignoring anomalous results from a single plant, our meta-analyses provide little support for a causal relationship between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia or nasopharyngeal cancer.","['Bachand, Annette M', 'Mundt, Kenneth A', 'Mundt, Diane J', 'Montgomery, Renika R']","['Bachand AM', 'Mundt KA', 'Mundt DJ', 'Montgomery RR']","['Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Assessment']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2010/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408440903341696 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2010;40(2):85-100. doi: 10.3109/10408440903341696.,10.3109/10408440903341696 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On MRI, the lesion appears isointense compared with normal grey matter in T1 and T2 weighted images and shows homogeneous contrast enhancement. With these findings, it is difficult to differentiate the lesion from other extraaxial tumours such as meningioma, paraganglioma, schwannoma, carcinoma, metastatic tumor, malignant lymphoma. However, granulocytic sarcoma, densely increased tumour cells restrict diffusion and reduce the extracellular volume fraction, tends to be markedly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted MR images and exhibits a marked decrease in ADC values.

We report here a patient with a masked translocation involving chromosomes 6,8 and 21. Chromosomal study at diagnosis initially reported the karyotype as translocation between chromosomes 6 and 8 without visible involvement of chromosome 21. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization studies revealed the involvement of chromosome 21 in the translocation and presence of the AML1-ETO chimeric gene. The complex rearrangement t(6;8;21) observed in our patient was not previously described and could be not detected without combination of techniques.

Acute myeloid leukemia in older adults is a biologically and clinically distinct entity. Based on analysis of cytogenetic and molecular data, it is known that leukemic cells in older patients are intrinsically resistant to standard chemotherapy. Due to comorbid disease and impaired bone marrow stem cell reserve, older adults tolerate myelosuppressive chemotherapy poorly, with a treatment-related mortality rate of 25%. In spite of various available targeted therapies, the overall survival has not improved dramatically in the past decade. The ideal post remission regimen in this population has always been a matter of debate. Standard allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is too dangerous to be considered as a mean to eradicate minimal residual disease after remission is obtained and myelointensive chemotherapy is not a beneficial post-remission strategy in this age cohort. These disappointing results call for more effective and less toxic therapeutic options. The advent of non-myeloablative regimens has shown some prospects in select group of patients with good performance status. This review focuses on current therapeutic options available in this group of patients.","['Ramamoorthy, K', 'Ramesh, P', 'Al Bahar, S']","['Ramamoorthy K', 'Ramesh P', 'Al Bahar S']","['Department of Hematology, Kuwait Cancer Control Centre, Shuwaikh.

ATRA-differentiated cells expressed high levels of CXCR4, and adhered more strongly to matrigel. Their ability to migrate and invade was enhanced by SDF-1alpha and lung homogenate, and diminished by pre-treatment with an anti-CXCR4 blocking antibody. SDF-1alpha was expressed in the lung tissues of all seven human donors. ATRA-differentiated NB4 cells infiltrated into lung tissues, and this was reduced by pre-treatment with an anti-CXCR4 blocking antibody.

Diphtheria toxin-stem cell factor (DT-SCF) is one such novel fusion toxin designed to target malignancies expressing c-kit. Since, c-kit overexpression has been reported on many types of cancers, it appeared to be a reasonably good molecule to target. In the present study, we report construction, expression, purification, and characterization of DT-SCF. DT-SCF gene coding for 1-387 amino acids of diphtheria toxin, His-Ala linker, 2-141 amino acids of SCF was cloned into expression vector with C terminal His tag. The induced DT-SCF protein was exclusively expressed in insoluble fraction. Purification of DT-SCF was achieved by inclusion body isolation and metal affinity chromatography under denaturing and reducing conditions. Purified DT-SCF was renatured partially on-column by gradually reducing denaturant concentration followed by complete refolding through rapid dilution technique. Cell viability assay provided the evidence that DT-SCF is a potent cytotoxic agent selective to cells expressing c-kit. The novelty of this study lies in employing SCF as a ligand in construction of fusion toxin to target wide range of malignancies expressing c-kit. Efficacy of DT-SCF fusion toxin was demonstrated over a range of malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia (K562), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT4), pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1), and cervical carcinoma (HeLa 229).

Here we present new data on the genomic organization of PEG10 by identifying the major transcription start site, a new splice variant and report the cloning and analysis of 1.9 kb of the PEG10 promoter. Furthermore, we show for the first time that PEG10 translation is initiated at a non-AUG start codon upstream of the previously predicted AUG codon as well as at the AUG codon. The finding that PEG10 translation is initiated at different sides adds a new aspect to the already interesting feature of PEG10's -1 frameshift translation mechanism. It is now important to unravel the cellular functions of the PEG10 protein variants and how they are related to normal or pathological conditions. The generated promoter-reporter constructs can be used for future studies to investigate how PEG10 expression is regulated. In summary, our study provides new data on the genomic organization as well as expression and translation of PEG10, a prerequisite in order to study and understand the role of PEG10 in cancer, embryonic development and normal cell homeostasis.","['Lux, Heike', 'Flammann, Heiko', 'Hafner, Mathias', 'Lux, Andreas']","['Lux H', 'Flammann H', 'Hafner M', 'Lux A']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PEG10 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/metabolism', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Codon', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Frameshift Mutation', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2010/01/20 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/20 06:00'],"['2009/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008686 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jan 13;5(1):e8686. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008686.,10.1371/journal.pone.0008686 [doi],20100113,,,,,PMC2800197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionary conserved key players of cellular identity that repress central developmental regulators by modifying chromatin structure. PcG-mediated repression is antagonized by trithorax group (trxG) proteins that prevent inappropriate repression by PcG proteins. The molecular basis for this antagonistic activity is unclear. So far, only few chromatin regulatory proteins have been associated with trxG function in Arabidopsis. Recent work revealed that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors of the Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-binding (CHD) subfamily have trxG-like functions in Arabidopsis.

One possible contributor to this could be suboptimal chemotherapy dosing in obese patients. We have previously found that vincristine (VCR) is less effective in obese compared to non-obese mice with leukemia, despite weight-based dosing. In the present study, we administered (3)H-VCR to obese and control mice to determine whether obesity would cause suboptimal VCR exposure. Blood VCR concentrations were fitted with a three-compartment model using pharmacokinetic analysis (two-stage PK) in three subsets of VCR concentrations vs. time method. Tissue and blood VCR concentrations were also analyzed using non-compartmental modeling. Blood VCR concentrations showed a triexponential decay and tended to be slightly higher in the obese mice at all time-points. However, the t(1/2,beta) and t(1/2,gamma) were shorter in the obese mice (9.7 min vs. 44.5 min and 60.3h vs. 85.6h, respectively), resulting in a lower AUC(0-infinity) (13,099 ng/m Lh vs. 15,384 ng/mL h). Had the dose of VCR been ""capped"", as is done in clinical practice, the AUC(0-infinity) would have been 36% lower in the obese mice than the controls. Tissue disposition of VCR revealed a biexponential decay from spleen, liver, and adipose. Interestingly, VCR slowly accumulated in the bone marrow of control mice, but had a slow decay from the marrow in the obese mice. Thus, obesity alters VCR PK, causing a lower overall exposure in circulation and bone marrow. Given the high prevalence of obesity, additional PK studies should be performed in obese subjects to optimize chemotherapy dosing regimens.","['Behan, James W', 'Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Yun, Jason P', 'Louie, Stan G', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Behan JW', 'Avramis VI', 'Yun JP', 'Louie SG', 'Mittelman SD']","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Dietary Fats)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', '*Diet', 'Dietary Fats/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Statistical', 'Obesity/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Vincristine/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",2010/01/20 06:00,2010/07/06 06:00,['2010/01/20 06:00'],"['2009/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-6618(10)00021-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2010.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2010 May;61(5):385-90. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2010.01.007.

Exposures to benzene both prenatally and during adulthood are associated with the development of disorders such as aplastic anemia and leukemia. Mechanisms of benzene toxicity are unknown; however, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by benzene metabolites may play a role. Little is known regarding the effects of benzene metabolites on erythropoiesis. Therefore, to determine the effects of in utero exposure to benzene on the growth and differentiation of fetal erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E), pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to benzene and CFU-E numbers were assessed in fetal liver (hematopoietic) tissue. In addition, to determine the effect of benzene metabolite-induced ROS generation on erythropoiesis, HD3 chicken erythroblast cells were exposed to benzene, phenol, or hydroquinone followed by stimulation of erythrocyte differentiation. Our results show that in utero exposure to benzene caused significant alterations in female offspring CFU-E numbers. In addition, exposure to hydroquinone, but not benzene or phenol, significantly reduced the percentage of differentiated HD3 cells, which was associated with an increase in ROS. Pretreatment of HD3 cells with polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) prevented hydroquinone-induced inhibition of erythropoiesis, supporting the hypothesis that ROS generation is involved in the development of benzene erythrotoxicity. In conclusion, this study provided evidence that ROS generated as a result of benzene metabolism may significantly alter erythroid differentiation, potentially leading to the development of Blood Disorders.","['Badham, Helen J', 'Winn, Louise M']","['Badham HJ', 'Winn LM']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology.

It also serves as a metabolic regulator in obese mice by blunting insulin activity. In contrast to other CXC chemokines, it remains to be clarified how CXCL14 activates its putative receptors on the cell surface and whether it induces chemokinesis. This is mainly due to the insufficient sensitivity of currently available bioassays for CXCL14. In this study, we found that the anti-CXCL14 monoclonal antibody, MAB730, remarkably enhances the activities of CXCL14 in human monocytic leukemia-derived THP-1 cells and immature dendritic cells. MAB730 augmented CXCL14-mediated chemotaxis and chemokinesis with distinct dose requirement. Chemotaxis inducing activity was retained in the MAB730 F(ab')(2) fraction, but not in the Fab fraction, implying that ligand dimerization is involved in the MAB730-assisted enhancement of CXCL14 activity. In addition, MAB730 was more efficient than heparin at inhibiting CXCL14 binding to low affinity receptors on THP-1 cells. Finally, in vivo administration of MAB730 antibody into high fat diet-induced obese mice increased whole body insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. These unique properties of MAB730 will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanism of cellular responses elicited by CXCL14.","['Tanegashima, Kosuke', 'Suzuki, Kenji', 'Nakayama, Yuki', 'Hara, Takahiko']","['Tanegashima K', 'Suzuki K', 'Nakayama Y', 'Hara T']","['The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Organization for Medical Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CXCL14 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Dietary Fats)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokines, CXC/*agonists/*immunology/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Diet, Atherogenic', 'Dietary Fats/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glucose Intolerance/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/physiology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects']",2010/01/20 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/01/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00027-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Apr 15;316(7):1263-70. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.016.

The hallmark genetic abnormality of CML is a chimeric BCR/ABL1 fusion gene resulting from the Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement t(9;22)(q34;q11). Clinical and laboratory studies indicate that the BCR/ABL1 fusion protein is essential for initiation, maintenance and progression of CML, yet the event(s) driving the transformation from chronic phase to blast phase are poorly understood. RESULTS: Here we report multiple genome aberrations in a collection of 78 CML and 14 control samples by oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization. We found a unique signature of genome deletions within the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and T cell receptor regions (TCR), frequently accompanied by concomitant loss of sequences within the short arm regions of chromosomes 7 and 9, including IKZF1, HOXA7, CDKN2A/2B, MLLT3, IFNA/B, RNF38, PAX5, JMJD2C and PDCD1LG2 genes. CONCLUSIONS: None of these genome losses were detected in any of the CML samples with myeloid transformation, chronic phase or controls, indicating that their presence is obligatory for the development of a malignant clone with a lymphoid phenotype. Notably, the coincidental deletions at IGH and TCR regions appear to precede the loss of IKZF1 and/or p16 genes in CML indicating a possible involvement of RAG in these deletions.","['Nacheva, Elisabeth P', 'Brazma, Diana', 'Virgili, Anna', 'Howard-Reeves, Julie', 'Chanalaris, Anastasios', 'Gancheva, Katya', 'Apostolova, Margarita', 'Valganon, Mikel', 'Mazzullo, Helen', 'Grace, Colin']","['Nacheva EP', 'Brazma D', 'Virgili A', 'Howard-Reeves J', 'Chanalaris A', 'Gancheva K', 'Apostolova M', 'Valganon M', 'Mazzullo H', 'Grace C']","['UCL School of Medicine, Cancer Institute, Academic Haematology, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, UK. e.nacheva@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics/immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Computational Biology', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Sequence Deletion']",2010/01/20 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2010/01/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-11-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-11-41 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2010 Jan 18;11:41. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-11-41.,10.1186/1471-2164-11-41 [doi],20100118,,,,,PMC2822760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which pipoxolan exerts its inhibitory effects and apoptotic activity in human leukaemia HL-60 cells. 2. The effects of pipoxolan on the proliferation of HL-60 cells and on the distribution of cells within different phases of the cell cycle were investigated indirectly using a Trypan blue assay and a flow cytometer, respectively. The effects of pipoxolan on the apoptosis of HL-60 cells was investigated using DNA fragmentation and flow cytometer. The expression of factors affecting the cell cycle and apoptosis, including p53, p21, Bax, Bcl2, cytochrome c, caspase 3 and caspase 9, was examined by western blotting. 3. At 6.25 microg/mL, pipoxolan significantly induced apoptosis in human leukaemia HL-60 cells after 24 h exposure. In addition, HL-60 cells were arrested in the G(0)/G(1) phase via the induction of p53/p21 by pipoxolan. Apoptosis was associated with an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, cleavage of procaspases-9 and -3 and hydrolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to play a key role in the pipoxolan-induced apoptosis, because high levels of ROS were produced early in the drug treatment. Apoptosis was significantly abrogated by the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC).","['Sheu, Ming-Jyh', 'Chou, Pei-Yu', 'Huang, Chin-Shiu', 'Tsai, I-Chun', 'Chien, Yi-Chung', 'Lin, Sung-Yuan', 'Tsai, Huei-Yann', 'Cheng, Hsu-Chen', 'Wu, Chieh-Hsi']","['Sheu MJ', 'Chou PY', 'Huang CS', 'Tsai IC', 'Chien YC', 'Lin SY', 'Tsai HY', 'Cheng HC', 'Wu CH']","['School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, 91, Hsueh-Shih Rd., Taichung, 404, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '493GZJ5T6I (pipoxolan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dioxolanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects']",2010/01/20 06:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2010/01/20 06:00'],"['2010/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['CEP5358 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1681.2010.05358.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2010 May;37(5-6):605-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2010.05358.x.

The study objective was to assess social outcomes in early adulthood after successful treatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor (WT) and infratentorial astrocytoma (IA). METHODS: Nordic patients treated for AML, WT and IA from 1985 to 2001 identified from a database administered by NOPHO (Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology) were invited to participate in a postal survey. All cancer-free survivors treated at age >1 year who were >19 years at time of study were eligible. Seventy-four percent; 247/335 responded. An age-equivalent group (N = 1,814) from a Norwegian Census Study served as controls. RESULTS: Mean age of survivors was 23 years (range 19-34), 55% females. The proportion with academic education (>/=4 years) was similar in survivors and controls (28 vs. 32%). Fifty-nine percent of survivors were employed compared to 77% among controls (p < .01). More survivors were recipients of social benefits (6.7 vs. 3.1%, p < .01). There were no differences in marital status but parenthood was more common among controls (37 vs. 27%, p = .01). Controls lived longer in their parental homes (p = .01). Cancer type or treatment intensity had no statistically significant impact on results, except for parenthood. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The study revealed important differences in social outcomes between survivors and controls early in adult life. Specific difficulties pertain to studying social status in early adulthood because of the natural transition characteristics for this age group. Therefore, longer follow-up is warranted.","['Johannsdottir, Inga M R', 'Hjermstad, Marianne J', 'Moum, Torbjorn', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur', 'Loge, Jon H']","['Johannsdottir IM', 'Hjermstad MJ', 'Moum T', 'Wesenberg F', 'Hjorth L', 'Schroder H', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Loge JH']","['National Resource Centre for Studies of Long-term Effects after Cancer, Department of Clinical Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway. i.m.johannsdottir@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Astrocytoma/mortality/*psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infratentorial Neoplasms/mortality/*psychology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/mortality/psychology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*psychology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', '*Social Behavior', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Wilms Tumor/mortality/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-009-0112-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2010 Jun;4(2):110-8. doi: 10.1007/s11764-009-0112-3.

In this study, we evaluated sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1's suitability as a diagnostic marker for malignant lymphoma by immunostaining formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using a well-defined commercial anti-sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 antibody. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 was strongly expressed on the surface of small lymphocytes forming primary lymphoid follicles and in the mantle zone of secondary lymphoid follicles. Microarray-based immunohistochemistry with tissue samples from 85 lymphoid malignancy cases demonstrated that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 was expressed on the surface of mantle cell lymphoma cells. Strong expression was observed in all classical mantle cell lymphoma cases involving the lymph node (19 out of 19), gastrointestinal tract (10 out of 10), bone marrow (9 out of 9), and orbita (1 out of 1). Good results were obtained even in sections where cyclin D1 signals were lost because of over-fixation and/or decalcification. One aggressive variant of mantle cell lymphoma displayed a weaker membranous staining than classical mantle cell lymphoma in the lymph node and bone marrow. In a cyclin D1-negative mantle cell lymphoma of the orbita, no conclusive result was obtained. No cases of follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, or Burkitt's lymphoma showed any significant expression, whereas 2 out of 6 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas in bone marrow, 1 out of 3 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas in the lymph node, and 2 out of 37 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas exhibited staining. A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of mantle cell lymphoma lines revealed the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 mRNA expression level to be well correlated with the results of immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Thus, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 immunohistochemistry may be useful in the histological diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma with formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections. The antigen may be particularly valuable in cases where cyclin D1 immunostaining is not successful.","['Nishimura, Hirotake', 'Akiyama, Takashi', 'Monobe, Yasumasa', 'Matsubara, Kiminori', 'Igarashi, Yasuyuki', 'Abe, Masafumi', 'Sugihara, Takashi', 'Sadahira, Yoshito']","['Nishimura H', 'Akiyama T', 'Monobe Y', 'Matsubara K', 'Igarashi Y', 'Abe M', 'Sugihara T', 'Sadahira Y']","['Department of Pathology, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (S1PR1 protein, human)', '0 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2009194 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2009.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Mar;23(3):439-49. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2009.194.

CONCLUSION: Although some of the findings are similar to those of previous studies examining patients with other cancers, this is the first known study to examine the lived experience of elderly patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. All participants experienced shock and fear at diagnosis.

Several cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules are required for generation, survival and maintenance of their suppressive effect. We and others have shown direct cytotoxic effect of the novel common gamma chain cytokine interleukin (IL)-21 on primary B cells from CLL patients. Since members of this family of cytokines are known to exhibit their effects on diverse immune cells, we have examined the effects of IL-21 on CLL patient derived regulatory T cell (Treg) induction, expansion and the inhibitory effect on natural killer cells in vitro. We demonstrate here the expression of IL-21 receptor in CD4(+)CD25(High) regulatory cells from CLL patients. In contrast to IL-2, the IL-21 cytokine failed to mediate expansion of regulatory T cells or induced expression of Foxp3 in CD4(+)CD25(Intermediate) or CD4(+)CD25(Dim/-) T cells in whole blood derived from CLL patients. Interestingly, in contrast to their differential effects on expansion of the CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)T cells, IL-2 and IL-21 exhibited a redundant role in Treg mediated suppression of NK cell mediated antibody dependent cytotoxicity function. Given the infusion related toxicities and pro-survival effect of IL-2 in CLL, these studies provide a rationale to explore IL-21 as an alternate gamma chain cytokine in CLL therapy.","['Gowda, Aruna', 'Ramanunni, Asha', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Rozewski, Darlene', 'Kindsvogel, Wayne', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Caligiuri, Michael', 'Byrd, John C', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Gowda A', 'Ramanunni A', 'Cheney C', 'Rozewski D', 'Kindsvogel W', 'Lehman A', 'Jarjoura D', 'Caligiuri M', 'Byrd JC', 'Muthusamy N']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-21)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-21/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10561 [pii]', '10.4161/mabs.2.1.10561 [doi]']",ppublish,MAbs. 2010 Jan-Feb;2(1):35-41. doi: 10.4161/mabs.2.1.10561.

To improve the outcome of the vaccine, a second cohort was vaccinated with a higher dose of 1,000 microg peptide. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine patients received four vaccinations subcutaneously at a biweekly interval. Immunomonitoring of cytotoxic CD8(+) as well as regulatory CD4(+) T cells was performed by flow cytometry as well as by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. Parameters of clinical response were assessed. RESULTS: In 4 of 9 patients (44%) we detected positive immunological responses. These patients showed an increase of CD8(+)RHAMM-R3_tetramer(+)/CD45RA(+)/CCR7(-)/CD27(-)/CD28(-) effector T cells and an increase of R3-specific CD8+ T cells. Two of these patients showed a significant decrease of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In one patient without response Tregs frequency increased from 5 to 16%. Three patients showed clinical effects: one patient with myelodysplastic syndrome RAEB-1 showed a reduction of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, another myelodysplastic syndrome patient an improvement of peripheral blood counts and one patient with multiple myeloma a reduction of free light chains. Clinical and immunological reactions were lower in this cohort than in the 300 microg cohort. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose RHAMM-R3 peptide vaccination induced immunological responses and positive clinical effects. Therefore, RHAMM constitutes a promising structure for further targeted immunotherapies in patients with different hematologic malignancies. However, higher doses of peptide did not improve the frequency and intensity of immune responses in this trial.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Rojewski, Markus T', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Funk, Isabel', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Hofmann, Susanne', 'Ritter, Gerd', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Greiner J', 'Schmitt A', 'Giannopoulos K', 'Rojewski MT', 'Gotz M', 'Funk I', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Bunjes D', 'Hofmann S', 'Ritter G', 'Dohner H', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23 89081 Ulm, Germany. jochen.greiner@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Immunity/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vaccination']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.014704 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.014704 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jul;95(7):1191-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.014704.

This raises the question of how the up-regulation of proneural genes required to initiate neurogenesis occurs in the presence of such inhibition. We carried out loss and gain of gene function, an interaction screen for binding partners, and biochemical analyses to uncover the regulation, developmental role, and mechanism of action of a ubiquitination adaptor protein, Btbd6a (BTB domain containing 6a). We find that the proneural gene neurog1 up-regulates btbd6a, which in turn is required for up-regulation of neurog1. Btbd6a is an adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and we find that it binds to the transcriptional repressor Plzf (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger). Btbd6a promotes the relocation of Plzf from nucleus to cytoplasm and targets Plzf for ubiquitination and degradation. plzfa is expressed widely in the neural epithelium; when overexpressed, it inhibits neurogenesis, and this inhibition is reversed by btbd6a. The antagonism of endogenous plzfa by btbd6a is required for neurogenesis, since the block in neuronal differentiation caused by btbd6a knockdown is alleviated by plzfa knockdown. These findings reveal a feedback loop mediated by degradation of an inhibitor that is essential for progenitors to undergo the transition to neuronal differentiation.","['Sobieszczuk, Dorothy F', 'Poliakov, Alexei', 'Xu, Qiling', 'Wilkinson, David G']","['Sobieszczuk DF', 'Poliakov A', 'Xu Q', 'Wilkinson DG']","['Division of Developmental Neurobiology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Btbd6a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Feedback, Physiological/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Neurogenesis/*physiology', 'Neurons/*cytology/physiology', 'Protein Transport', 'Ubiquitination', 'Zebrafish/embryology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/02/09 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['24/2/206 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.554510 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Jan 15;24(2):206-18. doi: 10.1101/gad.554510.,10.1101/gad.554510 [doi],,,,,"['MC_U117532048/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117560481/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U117532048/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC2807355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recognized carcinogen, azathioprine is also associated with the development of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML). METHODS: In 56 reported cases, azathioprine had been administered for a median of 65 months (range 6-192) to a median cumulative dose of 146 g (range 19-750) before t-MDS/AML developed. RESULTS: In 11 patients, repeated episodes of cytopenias developed during azathioprine therapy, ante-dating the development of t-MDS/AML. In 33 cases with successful karyotypic analysis, 26 cases (79%) showed monosomy 7, deletion of the long arm of chromosomes 7 and 5, and rearrangement of chromosome 11q23. These changes were cytogenetic hallmarks of MDS/AML secondary to known leukemogenic agents and radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The observations implicate azathioprine as a leukemogenic agent. It will be prudent to review the need for azathioprine therapy when unexpected cytopenias occur and prescription has been prolonged.","['Kwong, Yok-Lam']",['Kwong YL'],"['Professorial Block, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy', 'Azathioprine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/genetics']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jrheum.090834 [pii]', '10.3899/jrheum.090834 [doi]']",ppublish,J Rheumatol. 2010 Mar;37(3):485-90. doi: 10.3899/jrheum.090834.

Translation of this protein is initiated from full-length viral mRNA at an upstream initiation site in the same reading frame as Pr65(gag), the precursor for internal structural (Gag) proteins. Whereas gPr80gag is evolutionarily conserved among gammaretroviruses, its mechanism of action has been unclear, although it facilitates virus production at a late assembly or release step. Here, it is shown that gPr80gag facilitates release of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) from cells along an IFN-sensitive pathway. In particular, gPr80gag-facilitated release occurs through lipid rafts, because gPr80gag-negative M-MuLV has a lower cholesterol content, is less sensitive to inhibition of release by the cholesterol-depleting agent MbetaCD, and there is less Pr65gag associated with detergent-resistant membranes in mutant-infected cells. gPr80gag can also facilitate the release of HIV-1-based vector particles from human 293T cells.","['Nitta, Takayuki', 'Kuznetsov, Yurii', 'McPherson, Alexander', 'Fan, Hung']","['Nitta T', 'Kuznetsov Y', 'McPherson A', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism/physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Transport']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0908660107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0908660107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 19;107(3):1190-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0908660107.

The nature of the causative agent has an important bearing upon the characteristics, biology, time to onset and prognosis of the resultant leukaemia. Agents targeting topoisomerase II induce acute leukaemias with balanced translocations that generally arise within 3 years, often involving the MLL, RUNX1 and RARA loci at 11q23, 21q22 and 17q21 respectively. Chromosomal breakpoints have been found to be preferential sites of topoisomerase II cleavage, which are believed to be repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair pathway to generate chimaeric oncoproteins that underlie the resultant leukaemias. Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemias occurring after exposure to antimetabolites and/or alkylating agents are biologically distinct with a longer latency period, being characterised by more complex karyotypes and loss of p53. Although treatment of therapy-related leukaemias represents a considerable challenge due to prior therapy and comorbidities, curative therapy is possible, particularly in those with favourable karyotypic features.","['Joannides, Melanie', 'Grimwade, David']","['Joannides M', 'Grimwade D']","[""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'Chromosome Breakage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1255 [pii]', '10.1007/s12094-010-0460-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2010 Jan;12(1):8-14. doi: 10.1007/s12094-010-0460-5.,10.1007/s12094-010-0460-5 [doi],,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases where a neoplasm was suspected based on clinical observations, samples were obtained for complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, and flow cytometric analysis. Animals confirmed to have neoplasms were euthanized and underwent necropsy. Histological samples were obtained from abnormal tissues and suspect lesions. The phenotype of the malignancies was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of processed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and affected tissues. Five cases of spontaneous myeloid leukemia were identified in adult animals older than 30 months of age. All animals presented with symptoms of weight loss, lethargy, and marked leukocytosis. At autopsy, all animals had systemic disease involvement and presented with severe hepatosplenomegaly. Three of the five myelogenous leukemias have successfully been expanded in vitro.

RCAS1 expression is associated with aggressive characteristics and poor overall survival for 15 different human malignancies. The putative RCAS1 receptor has not been isolated and the mechanism of RCAS1 apoptosis induction remains unclear. This study explores how RCAS1 is involved in apoptosis initiation. The cell lines SiSo and MCF-7, human uterine carcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma, respectively, both express RCAS1, but RCAS1 secretion is undetectable in MCF-7 cells. SiSo and MCF-7 cells were stimulated to induce RCAS1 ectodomain shedding followed by assessment of RCAS1 expression and secretion. Additionally, the RCAS1 putative receptor-expressing human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 was co-cultured with SiSo, MCF-7, or soluble RCAS1 to follow RCAS1 secretion in apoptosis initiation. RCAS1 secretion was strongly suppressed by inhibitors of metalloproteases, protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). K562 apoptosis could be induced only by co-culturing with SiSo or soluble RCAS1. RCAS1 is thus secreted by ectodomain shedding, which may represent a pivotal step in RCAS1-induced apoptosis initiation.","['Sonoda, Kenzo', 'Miyamoto, Shingo', 'Nakashima, Manabu', 'Wake, Norio']","['Sonoda K', 'Miyamoto S', 'Nakashima M', 'Wake N']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan. kenzo@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp <kenzo@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (EBAG9 protein, human)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/immunology/pathology']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00012-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Jul 1;316(11):1795-803. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.011.

As the risk of developing ALL is inversely associated to the gestational age at birth, we investigated if this increased risk could be explained by an increase in prevalence and quantity of pre-leukaemic t(12;21)-positive children born prematurely. Using a sensitive qRT-PCR assay, we screened messenger RNA from fresh umbilical cord-blood samples from 256 premature children. In none of the neonates, t(12;21)-positive cells could be demonstrated. Therefore, no increase in the prevalence and magnitude of preleukaemic t(12;21)-positive cells compared to previously published data from mature children could be demonstrated.

Here, we use a functional interaction proteomics approach to map pathways by which Bcr-Abl regulates defined cellular processes. The results show that Bcr-Abl regulates the actin cytoskeleton and non-apoptotic membrane blebbing via a GADS/Slp-76/Nck1 adaptor protein pathway. The binding of GADS to Bcr-Abl requires Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity and is sensitive to the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib, while the GADS/Slp-76 and Slp-76/Nck interactions are tyrosine phosphorylation independent. All three adaptor proteins co-localize with cortical actin in membrane blebs. Downregulation of each adaptor protein disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and membrane blebbing in a similar fashion and similar to imatinib. These findings highlight the importance of protein interaction dependent adaptor protein pathways in oncogenic kinase signaling.","['Preisinger, Christian', 'Kolch, Walter']","['Preisinger C', 'Kolch W']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK. c.preisinger@uu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRAP2 protein, human)', '0 (Nck protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SLP-76 signal Transducing adaptor proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cell Surface Extensions/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/*enzymology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/05/06 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(10)00015-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2010 May;22(5):848-56. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.12.012.

Other symptoms included anemia (80.0%), thrombocytopenia (60.0%), leucocytosis (53.3%), pancytopenia (20.0%) and the absence of B-symptom. (2) The proportion of hairy cells was (14.6 +/- 7.2)% in periphery blood and (47.3 +/- 23.8)% in bone marrow. The positive rate of TRAP assay was 62.5% in bone marrow; 85.7% for TPA test and the detection rate for RLC was 25% by transmission electric microscopy. The frequency of bone marrow involvement was 100%. (3) The average weight of 15 spleens was (3012 +/- 1974) g. The size of 6 spleens ranged from 16 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm to 32 cm x 20 cm x 14 cm. The white pulp of spleen showed a characteristic atrophy feature or even absent due to leukemic infiltration, predominantly involving the red pulp with some sinusoidal pattern. ""Blood pool"" change was an infrequent feature (3/15 cases). The nuclei of leukemic cells were round (13 cases) or bean-shaped (2 cases), nucleoli inconspicuous or disappeared. The abundant cytoplasm and prominent cell border resulted in a ""fried egg"" appearance. By immunohistochemistry, leukemic cells were positive for CD45RA, CD20, PAX-5, CD25, CD11c, Annexin A1 and cyclinD1, but negative for CD3 and CD43. (4) 13 cases (86.7%) have been followed-up and all are alive. Among them, 9 cases are living well more than 5 years and 7 more than 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Splenomegaly is frequently the first manifestation of patients with HCL and occurred predominantly in the middle to elderly adults. Definite diagnosis of HCL requires a combined histological and immunohistochemical assessment of the splenectomy specimen, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate.","['Li, Zhan-qi', 'Chen, Hui-shu', 'Liu, En-bin', 'Sun, Qi', 'Fang, Li-huan', 'Sun, Fu-jun', 'Zhang, Pei-hong', 'Yang, Qing-ying', 'Qiu, Lu-gui']","['Li ZQ', 'Chen HS', 'Liu EB', 'Sun Q', 'Fang LH', 'Sun FJ', 'Zhang PH', 'Yang QY', 'Qiu LG']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Annexin A1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'CD11c Antigen/metabolism', 'CD79 Antigens/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/*pathology', '*Splenectomy', 'Survival Rate']",2010/01/19 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Nov;38(11):769-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 40 cases of LPL with WM diagnosed according to the 2008 World Health Organization classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues were analyzed using immunophenotype and follow-up information. RESULTS: The mostly common initial clinical presentations were non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, anemia and hemorrhage. Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were found in 42.5%, 20.0% and 12.5% of the patients respectively. The pattern of bone marrow involvement included mixed type (47.2%), diffuse type (41.7%) and interstitial type (11.1%). The nodal architecture was completely destroyed in one case and partially effaced with residual germinal centers and dilated sinuses in 8 cases. All of the neoplastic cells expressed CD20 and CD79a. Neoplastic plasma cells were positive for CD138 and CD79a. No cases expressed CD5. Four cases weakly expressed CD23. No significant prognosis related factors were identified in the survival analysis.

The proportion of equivalently expressed genes (pi(0)) is a key component to be estimated in the estimation of FDR. Some commonly used pi(0) estimators (BUM, SPLOSH, QVALUE, and LBE ) are all based on p-values, and they are essentially upper bounds of pi(0). The simulations we carried out show that these four methods significantly overestimate the true pi(0) when differentially expressed genes and equivalently expressed genes are not well separated. To solve this problem, we first introduce a novel way of transforming the test statistics to make them symmetric about 0. Then we propose a pi(0) estimator based on the transformed test statistics using the symmetry assumption. Real data application and simulation both show that the pi(0) estimate from our method is less conservative than BUM, SPLOSH, QVALUE, and LBE in most of the cases. Simulation results also show that our estimator always has the least mean squared error among these five methods.","['Jiao, Shuo', 'Zhang, Shunpu']","['Jiao S', 'Zhang S']","['Department of Statistics, University of Nebraska Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska 68583, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', '*Computational Biology', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', '*Models, Statistical', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/01/19 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cmb.2009.0060 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2010 Feb;17(2):177-87. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2009.0060.,10.1089/cmb.2009.0060 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To search for genetic markers, we comprehensively investigated the genomic profile, TP53 abnormalities, and immunoglobulin heavy gene (IGH) mutation in a large cohort of SMZLs. 1 Mb resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on 25 SMZLs identified 7q32 deletion (44%) as the most frequent copy number change, followed by gains of 3q (32%), 8q (20%), 9q34 (20%), 12q23-24 (8%), and chromosome 18 (12%), and losses of 6q (16%), 8p (12%), and 17p (8%). High-resolution chromosome 7 tile-path aCGH on 17 SMZLs with 7q32 deletion identified by 1 Mb aCGH or interphase FISH screening mapped the minimal common deletion to a 3 Mb region at 7q32.1-32.2. Although it is not yet possible to identify the genes targeted by the deletion, interphase FISH screening showed that the deletion was seen in SMZL (19/56 = 34%) and splenic B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia unclassifiable (3/9 = 33%), but not in 39 cases of other splenic lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 14), hairy cell leukaemia (4), mantle cell lymphoma (12), follicular lymphoma (6), and others. In SMZL, 7q32 deletion was inversely correlated with trisomy 18, but not associated with other copy number changes, TP53 abnormalities, or IGH mutation status. None of the genetic parameters examined showed significant and independent association with overall or event-free survival. In conclusion, 7q32 deletion is a characteristic feature of SMZL, albeit seen in isolated cases of splenic B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia unclassifiable, and its detection may help the differential diagnosis of splenic B-cell lymphomas.","['Watkins, A James', 'Huang, Yuanxue', 'Ye, Hongtao', 'Chanudet, Estelle', 'Johnson, Nicola', 'Hamoudi, Rifat', 'Liu, Hongxiang', 'Dong, Gehong', 'Attygalle, Ayoma', 'McPhail, Ellen D', 'Law, Mark E', 'Isaacson, Peter G', 'de Leval, Laurence', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Du, Ming-Qing']","['Watkins AJ', 'Huang Y', 'Ye H', 'Chanudet E', 'Johnson N', 'Hamoudi R', 'Liu H', 'Dong G', 'Attygalle A', 'McPhail ED', 'Law ME', 'Isaacson PG', 'de Leval L', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Du MQ']","['Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trisomy']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.2665 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2010 Mar;220(4):461-74. doi: 10.1002/path.2665.,10.1002/path.2665 [doi],,,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis showed that TAN arrested the cells in the G(2)/M phase and stimulated an accumulation of the cells in the sub-G(0) phase. TAN-induced cell death was evidenced by poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage, DNA laddering fragmentation, activation of the caspase cascade and downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). Pretreatment with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK_blocked caspase activation and cell cycle arrest but did not inhibit apoptosis which suggest that other cell killing mechanisms like endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated cell death pathways could be involved. We demonstrated that TAN-induced apoptosis was preceded by a rapid activation of the proapoptotic arm of the unfolded protein response, namely PKR-like ER kinase. This was accompanied by enhanced levels of glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa and of spliced X-box binding protein 1. Furthermore, TAN sensitized K562 cells to the cell killing effects of imatinib via an apoptotic mechanism. In conclusion, our results suggest that TAN is able to induce apoptosis in Bcr-Abl+ cells via cell cycle arrest and the induction of the unfolded protein response, and has synergistic cytotoxicity with imatinib.","['Lust, Sofie', 'Vanhoecke, Barbara', 'Van Gele, Mireille', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Bracke, Marc', 'Offner, Fritz']","['Lust S', 'Vanhoecke B', 'Van Gele M', 'Philippe J', 'Bracke M', 'Offner F']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Ghent, De Pintelaan 185, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'I4TLA1DLX6 (tangeretin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*drug effects']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mnfr.200900186 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2010 Jun;54(6):823-32. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200900186.,10.1002/mnfr.200900186 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed method enables class prediction by an ensemble of logistic regression models for a high-dimensional data set, which is impossible by a single logistic regression model due to the restriction that the sample size needs to be larger than the number of predictors. The proposed classification method is applied to gene expression data on pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to predict each patient's risk for treatment failure or relapse at the time of diagnosis. Hence, specific prognostic biomarkers can be used to predict outcomes in pediatric AML and formulate individual risk-adjusted treatment. Our study shows that the proposed method is comparable to other widely used models in generalized accuracy and is significantly improved in balance between sensitivity and specificity.

METHODS: The study consisted of patients who had completed treatment for BT (n=36) or acute leukaemia (n=35) and were aged between 8 and 19. Healthy children (n=60) were selected from among pupils of schools. HRQL was evaluated directly and indirectly on the basis of the Polish language version of the PedsQLTM 4.0 Generic Core scales. The influence of selected factors (sex, age, time from the end of treatment and type of treatment) on the HRQL result was analysed. RESULTS: In all the aspects analysed (total, physical, psychosocial, emotional, social and school functioning), the HRQL of BT and leukaemia survivors was significantly lower in comparison to their healthy peers. The HRQL of patients after BT treatment was also significantly lower than that of the survivors of leukaemia. The parent-proxy reported HRQL was consistent with the children's selfassessment. Patients treated with radiotherapy presented a significantly lower evaluation of life quality in the physical sphere. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of HRQL should be treated as an additional independent parameter in an assessment of the long-term results of oncological treatment.","['Pogorzala, Monika', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Kurylak, Andrzej', 'Debski, Robert', 'Wojtkiewicz, Magdalena', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Pogorzala M', 'Styczynski J', 'Kurylak A', 'Debski R', 'Wojtkiewicz M', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, ul.

It includes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) has not been described earlier in relation to breast cancer and its therapy. T-PLL is a rare chronic T-cell lymphoproliferative disease with a mature post-thymic T-cell immunophenotype and aggressive clinical course. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45 year old Indian female of Nordic origin presented 5 years back with a lump in the right breast and the axilla. She underwent modified radical mastectomy. Histophotomicrograph of the excised breast lesion showed a 2.1 cm duct carcinoma, positive for ER and PR with 1 out of 25 lymph nodes positive for metastasis. She received 6 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-fluorouracil. This was followed by tamoxifen 20 mg per day for five years. She was doing well on follow up until the completion of fifth year of her disease, when she presented with complaints of mild fever and weakness. Examination revealed generalized lymph node enlargement along with hepatomegaly. Hemogram showed mild anemia, normal platelet count and a leukocyte count of 1.2 x 10(11)/L. Peripheral blood examination revealed medium sized lymphoid cells, constituting almost 75% of total nucleated cell population. Immunophenotying, established a diagnosis of post thymic T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was done which revealed an anterior mediastinal mass with destruction of sternum along with multiple small nodular shadows in bilateral lung fields suggestive of lung metastasis. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the mass showed atypical ductal cells with nuclear pleomorphism, which were positive for ER, PR and Her2neu protein. This confirmed a co-existent metastatic breast carcinoma. She was started on chemotherapy for T-PLL along with hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitor. Unfortunately, both her malignancies progressed after an initial stable disease of two months. CONCLUSION: Our case describes the potential of breast chemotherapy to cause grave second hematological malignancies of the T-cell lymphoid lineage, not described earlier. Such events highlight the importance to identify those patients of breast cancer in whom chemotherapy can safely be avoided.","['Singhal, Manish', 'Raina, Vinod', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Das, Prasenjit']","['Singhal M', 'Raina V', 'Gupta R', 'Das P']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital (IRCH), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cases J,Cases journal,101474272,,,,2010/01/16 06:00,2010/01/16 06:01,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1186/1757-1626-3-4 [doi]'],epublish,Cases J. 2010 Jan 4;3:4. doi: 10.1186/1757-1626-3-4.,10.1186/1757-1626-3-4 [doi],20100104,,,,,PMC2806858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some are still active, notably in mice the highly polymorphic early transposon (ETn)/MusD and intracisternal A-type particles (IAP). ERVs are transcriptionally silenced during early embryogenesis by histone and DNA methylation (and reviewed in ref. 7), although the initiators of this process, which is essential to protect genome integrity, remain largely unknown. KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1, also known as tripartite motif-containing protein 28, TRIM28) represses genes by recruiting the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the NuRD histone deacetylase complex, but few of its physiological targets are known. Two lines of evidence suggest that KAP1-mediated repression could contribute to the control of ERVs: first, KAP1 can trigger permanent gene silencing during early embryogenesis, and second, a KAP1 complex silences the retrovirus murine leukaemia virus in embryonic cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, here we show that KAP1 deletion leads to a marked upregulation of a range of ERVs, in particular IAP elements, in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and in early embryos. We further demonstrate that KAP1 acts synergistically with DNA methylation to silence IAP elements, and that it is enriched at the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of IAP genomes, where KAP1 deletion leads to the loss of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), a hallmark of KAP1-mediated repression. Correspondingly, IAP 5'UTR sequences can impose in cis KAP1-dependent repression on a heterologous promoter in ES cells. Our results establish that KAP1 controls endogenous retroelements during early embryonic development.","['Rowe, Helen M', 'Jakobsson, Johan', 'Mesnard, Daniel', 'Rougemont, Jacques', 'Reynard, Severine', 'Aktas, Tugce', 'Maillard, Pierre V', 'Layard-Liesching, Hillary', 'Verp, Sonia', 'Marquis, Julien', 'Spitz, Francois', 'Constam, Daniel B', 'Trono, Didier']","['Rowe HM', 'Jakobsson J', 'Mesnard D', 'Rougemont J', 'Reynard S', 'Aktas T', 'Maillard PV', 'Layard-Liesching H', 'Verp S', 'Marquis J', 'Spitz F', 'Constam DB', 'Trono D']","['School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim28 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Acetylation', 'Animals', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism/virology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08674 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08674 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Jan 14;463(7278):237-40. doi: 10.1038/nature08674.,10.1038/nature08674 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that BAX and PUMA promoters harbour an identical MAR element and are transcriptional targets of SMAR1. On mild DNA damage, SMAR1 selectively represses BAX and PUMA through binding to the MAR independently of inducing p53 deacetylation through HDAC1. This generates an anti-apoptotic response leading to cell cycle arrest. Importantly, knockdown of SMAR1 induces apoptosis, which is abrogated in the absence of p53. Conversely, apoptotic DNA damage results in increased size and number of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies with consequent sequestration of SMAR1. This facilitates p53 acetylation and restricts SMAR1 binding to BAX and PUMA MAR leading to apoptosis. Thus, our study establishes MAR as a damage responsive cis element and SMAR1-PML crosstalk as a switch that modulates the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.","['Sinha, Surajit', 'Malonia, Sunil Kumar', 'Mittal, Smriti P K', 'Singh, Kamini', 'Kadreppa, Sreenath', 'Kamat, Rohan', 'Mukhopadhyaya, Robin', 'Pal, Jayanta K', 'Chattopadhyay, Samit']","['Sinha S', 'Malonia SK', 'Mittal SP', 'Singh K', 'Kadreppa S', 'Kamat R', 'Mukhopadhyaya R', 'Pal JK', 'Chattopadhyay S']","['National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune University Campus, Ganeshkhind, Pune, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BANP protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Matrix Attachment Regions', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2008/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2009395 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2009.395 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2010 Feb 17;29(4):830-42. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2009.395.

With a few exceptions, response to treatment is unsatisfactory and prognosis is poor. Studies indicate that specific cytogenetic abnormalities, identified by classical G-banding, correlate with prognosis. These findings advanced the ability to predict outcome and to tailor treatments in AML. These studies also suggested that a more detailed analysis of somatic genomic mutations might extend these advances. RECENT FINDINGS: New technologies, including DNA arrays and automated sequencing, have improved detection of subtle, acquired genomic alterations. DNA array based screening approaches permit detection of copy number alterations (CNAs) of less than 5 Mb in size. Subchromosomal copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) can also be detected using approaches that take advantage of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human genome. However, identification of single nucleotide variants in leukemic clones still requires targeted or massive sequencing approaches. SUMMARY: Recent studies suggest that CNAs and CNN-LOH occur frequently in AML. Recurring abnormalities have been identified which may be relevant to disease pathogenesis. However, larger studies will be required to determine the relevance of these alterations to prognostic prediction or therapeutic targeting.","['Eklund, Elizabeth A']",['Eklund EA'],"['The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA. e-eklund@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Gene Dosage', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366c43 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Mar;17(2):75-8. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366c43.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366c43 [doi],,18,,,"['R01 HL087717/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087717-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL088747/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL088747-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2832212,,,['NIHMS180989'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to gather epidemiological information on childhood cancer in Iceland. METHODS: The study was population based and included all children younger than 18 years of age, diagnosed with cancer in Iceland from 1981 to 2006. Information was extracted from the Icelandic Cancer Registry and patient hospital records. RESULTS: During the study period 288 cancer cases were diagnosed in 279 children, 10 cases were secondary neoplasms. Age standardized incidence was 16.1 per 100.000 (95% CI 13,6-18,6) for boys and 12.8 per 100.000 (95% CI 10,5-15,0) for girls. There was no significant difference in the incidence rate between the first and second half of the study period. For children aged 0-14 years, the age standardized incidence was 13.6 per 100.000. The incidence was highest in the 0-4 year age group (17.3 per 100.000) and in the 15-17 year age group (19.6 per 100.000). Brain tumors (27.1%) and leukemia (25.0%) were the most common cancer groups diagnosed. Lymphoid leukemia was the most common cancer type (17.9%) and astrocytoma (13.1%) came second. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood cancer in Iceland is similar to other Western countries. Long-term follow-up is very important in childhood cancer survivors.","['Oskarsson, Trasuti', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Kristinsson, Jon R', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur K', 'Jonasson, Jon Gunnlaugur', 'Haraldsson, Asgeir']","['Oskarsson T', 'Jonsson OG', 'Kristinsson JR', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Jonasson JG', 'Haraldsson A']","['Barnaspitali hringsins, Landspitala Hringbraut, Reykjavik.']",['ice'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Iceland,Laeknabladid,Laeknabladid,7901326,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Time Factors']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17992/lbl.2010.01.04 [doi]'],ppublish,Laeknabladid. 2010 Jan;96(1):21-6. doi: 10.17992/lbl.2010.01.04.,10.17992/lbl.2010.01.04 [doi],,,,,,,,Krabbamein hja bornum a lslandi arin 1981-2006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficient RCT design is therefore crucial for timely introduction of these medical advances into clinical practice, and a variety of designs have been proposed for this purpose. To guide design and interpretation of RCTs evaluating biomarkers, we present an in-depth comparison of advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used designs. Key aspects of the discussion include efficiency comparisons and special interim monitoring issues that arise because of the complexity of these RCTs. Important ongoing and completed trials are used as examples.

Intergenic miRNAs are expressed by their own promoter, and until recently, it was supposed that intronic miRNAs are transcribed from their host gene. Here, we performed a genomic analysis of currently known intronic miRNA regions and observed that approximately 35% of intronic miRNAs have upstream regulatory elements consistent with promoter function. Among all intronic miRNAs, 30% have associated Pol II regulatory elements, including transcription start sites, CpG islands, expression sequence tags, and conserved transcription factor binding sites, while 5% contain RNA Pol III regulatory elements (A/B box sequences). We cloned intronic regions encompassing miRNAs and their upstream Pol II (miR-107, miR-126, miR-208b, miR-548f-2, miR-569, and miR-590) or Pol III (miR-566 and miR-128-2) sequences into a promoterless plasmid, and confirmed that miRNA expression occurs independent of host gene transcription. For miR-128-2, a miRNA overexpressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ChIP analysis suggests dual regulation by both intronic (Pol III) and host gene (Pol II) promoters. These data support complex regulation of intronic miRNA expression, and have relevance to disregulation in disease settings.","['Monteys, Alex Mas', 'Spengler, Ryan M', 'Wan, Ji', 'Tecedor, Luis', 'Lennox, Kimberly A', 'Xing, Yi', 'Davidson, Beverly L']","['Monteys AM', 'Spengler RM', 'Wan J', 'Tecedor L', 'Lennox KA', 'Xing Y', 'Davidson BL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Introns', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase III/metabolism']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.1731910 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.1731910 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2010 Mar;16(3):495-505. doi: 10.1261/rna.1731910.

Here, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting the ubiquitination pathway at the level of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 (E1). By immunoblotting, leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples had increased protein ubiquitination. Therefore, we examined the effects of genetic and chemical inhibition of the E1 enzyme. Knockdown of E1 decreased the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in leukemia and myeloma cells and induced cell death. To further investigate effects of E1 inhibition in malignancy, we discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor, 3,5-dioxopyrazolidine compound, 1-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-4-[(5-nitro-2-furyl)methylene]-3,5-pyrazolidinedione (PYZD-4409). PYZD-4409 induced cell death in malignant cells and preferentially inhibited the clonogenic growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, genetic or chemical inhibition of E1 increased expression of E1 stress markers. Moreover, BI-1 overexpression blocked cell death after E1 inhibition, suggesting ER stress is functionally important for cell death after E1 inhibition. Finally, in a mouse model of leukemia, intraperitoneal administration of PYZD-4409 decreased tumor weight and volume compared with control without untoward toxicity. Thus, our work highlights the E1 enzyme as a novel target for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Xu, G Wei', 'Ali, Mohsin', 'Wood, Tabitha E', 'Wong, Derek', 'Maclean, Neil', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Skrtic, Marko', 'Li, Xiaoming', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Mao, Xinliang', 'Venkatesan, Meenakshi', 'Beheshti Zavareh, Reza', 'Ketela, Troy', 'Reed, John C', 'Rose, David', 'Moffat, Jason', 'Batey, Robert A', 'Dhe-Paganon, Sirano', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Xu GW', 'Ali M', 'Wood TE', 'Wong D', 'Maclean N', 'Wang X', 'Gronda M', 'Skrtic M', 'Li X', 'Hurren R', 'Mao X', 'Venkatesan M', 'Beheshti Zavareh R', 'Ketela T', 'Reed JC', 'Rose D', 'Moffat J', 'Batey RA', 'Dhe-Paganon S', 'Schimmer AD']","['The Princess Margaret Hospital, The Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D3/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology/*therapy', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56635-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-231191 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 18;115(11):2251-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-231191.

In the mouse, Gfi1 deficiency causes neutropenia and an accumulation of granulomonocytic precursor cells that is reminiscent of a myelodysplastic syndrome. We report here that a variant allele of GFI1 (GFI1(36N)) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in white subjects with an odds ratio of 1.6 (P < 8 x 10(-5)). The GFI1(36N) variant occurred in 1806 AML patients with an allele frequency of 0.055 compared with 0.035 in 1691 healthy control patients in 2 independent cohorts. We observed that both GFI1 variants maintain the same activity as transcriptional repressors but differ in their regulation by the AML1/ETO (RUNX1/RUNX1T1) fusion protein produced in AML patients with a t(8;21) translocation. AML1/ETO interacts and colocalizes with the more common GFI1(36S) form in the nucleus and inhibits its repressor activity. However, the variant GFI1(36N) protein has a different subnuclear localization than GFI1(36S). As a consequence, AML1/ETO does not colocalize with GFI1(36N) and is unable to inhibit its repressor activity. We conclude that both variants of GFI1 differ in their ability to be regulated by interacting proteins and that the GFI1(36N) variant form exhibits distinct biochemical features that may confer a predisposition to AML.","['Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Sharif-Askari, Ehssan', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Lohmann, Dietmar', 'Horsthemke, Bernhard', 'Siffert, Winfried', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Grzeschik, Karl-Heinz', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Schackert, Hans K', 'Afshar, Khashayar', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Peeters, Justine K', 'Kroschinsky, Frank', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Khandanpour C', 'Thiede C', 'Valk PJ', 'Sharif-Askari E', 'Nuckel H', 'Lohmann D', 'Horsthemke B', 'Siffert W', 'Neubauer A', 'Grzeschik KH', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Marcucci G', 'Maharry K', 'Slovak ML', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'Schackert HK', 'Afshar K', 'Schnittger S', 'Peeters JK', 'Kroschinsky F', 'Ehninger G', 'Lowenberg B', 'Duhrsen U', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal (IRCM) and Departement de Microbiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H2W 1R7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56598-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-239822 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 25;115(12):2462-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-239822.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether a red wine polyphenolic extract (RWPs, a rich source of polyphenols; 2.9g/L) affects the proliferation of human lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (Jurkat cells) and, if so, to determine the underlying mechanism. Cell proliferation and viability were determined by the MTS and trypan blue exclusion assays, respectively. Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis activity and oxidative stress levels were assessed by flow cytometry, and the expression of p73, UHRF1 and active caspase-3 by Western blot analysis. RWPs inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, RWPs triggered apoptosis, which is associated with an increased expression level of the pro-apoptotic protein p73 and the active caspase-3. RWPs induced apoptosis confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis, and this effect was associated with down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein UHRF1. Furthermore RWPs significantly increased the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular scavengers of superoxide anions (MnTMPyP, MnTBAP, PEG-SOD) prevented the RWPs-induced formation of ROS and apoptosis, while native extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) was without effect. In addition, the effect of RWPs on the expression levels of p73, active caspase-3 and UHRF1 was also prevented by MnTMPyP. Thus, these findings indicate that RWPs induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells by a redox-sensitive mechanism involving the intracellular formation of superoxide anions and consequently the up-regulation of p73 and down-regulation of UHRF1.","['Sharif, Tanveer', 'Auger, Cyril', 'Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Ebel, Claudine', 'Achour, Mayada', 'Etienne-Selloum, Nelly', 'Fuhrmann, Guy', 'Bronner, Christian', 'Schini-Kerth, Valerie B']","['Sharif T', 'Auger C', 'Alhosin M', 'Ebel C', 'Achour M', 'Etienne-Selloum N', 'Fuhrmann G', 'Bronner C', 'Schini-Kerth VB']","['UMR CNRS 7213, Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', '*Wine']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2009/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00960-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.12.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Mar;46(5):983-94. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.12.029.

Pluronic (triblock copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO) were previously shown to sensitize MDR tumors to antineoplastic agents. This study uses animal models of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL-M27) and T-lymphocytic leukemia (P388/ADR and P388) derived solid tumors to delineate mechanisms of sensitization of MDR tumors by Pluronic P85 (P85) in vivo. First, non-invasive single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and tumor tissue radioactivity sampling demonstrate that intravenous co-administration of P85 with a Pgp substrate, 99Tc-sestamibi, greatly increases the tumor uptake of this substrate in the MDR tumors. Second, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) in live animals and tumor tissue sampling for ATP suggest that P85 and doxorubicin (Dox) formulations induce pronounced ATP depletion in MDR tumors. Third, these formulations are shown to increase tumor apoptosis in vivo by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for caspases 8 and 9. Altogether, formulation of Dox with P85 results in increased inhibition of the growth solid tumors in mice and represents novel and promising strategy for therapy of drug resistant cancers.","['Batrakova, Elena V', 'Li, Shu', 'Brynskikh, Anna M', 'Sharma, Amit K', 'Li, Yili', 'Boska, Michael', 'Gong, Nan', 'Mosley, R Lee', 'Alakhov, Valery Yu', 'Gendelman, Howard E', 'Kabanov, Alexander V']","['Batrakova EV', 'Li S', 'Brynskikh AM', 'Sharma AK', 'Li Y', 'Boska M', 'Gong N', 'Mosley RL', 'Alakhov VY', 'Gendelman HE', 'Kabanov AV']","['College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 985830 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5830, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['106392-12-5 (Poloxamer)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Poloxamer/*pharmacology', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(10)00013-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2010 May 10;143(3):290-301. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.01.004.

Multiple active mechanisms, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, have been proposed in therapy; however, the opposing effects of arsenic remain controversial. Our previous study found that arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced activation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21) led to A431 cell death through the antagonistic effects of the signaling of ERK1/2 and JNK1. In the current study, the inhibitory effects of JNK1 on ATO-induced p21 expression were explored. Over-expression of JNK1 in A431 cells could inhibit p21 expression, which was associated with HDAC1 and TGIF. Using the GST pull-down assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-108) of TGIF, critical to its binding with c-Jun, was found. Using reporter assays, requirement of the C-terminal domain (amino acids 138-272) of TGIF to suppress ATO-induced p21 expression was observed. Thus, the domains of TGIF that carried out its inhibitory effects on p21 were identified. Finally, treatment with JNK inhibitor SP600125 could enhance ATO-induced apoptosis of HaCaT keratinocytes by using flow cytometry.","['Huang, Huei-Sheng', 'Liu, Zi-Miao', 'Hong, Duang-Yang']","['Huang HS', 'Liu ZM', 'Hong DY']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan. huanghs@mail.ncku.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/*drug effects/*enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/physiology']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2009/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(10)00002-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.12.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2010 Apr 15;244(2):234-41. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.12.037.

The greater pro-apoptotic ability was shown by both essential oil of Verbena officinalis and citral at lower concentrations (after 4 h A 0.1%: 17.8% vs 37.1%; A 0.01%: 15.8% vs 52%; B 0.1%: 18.4% vs 46.4%; B 0.01%: 15.8% vs 54.2%; after 8 h A 0.1%: 23% vs 38%; A 0.01%: 22.2% vs 55%; B 0.1%: 32% vs 42.2%; B 0.01%: 22% vs 54.3%; after 24 h A 0.1%: 5% vs 20.7%; A 0.01%: 25.8% vs 47.2%; B 0.1%: 18.4% vs 46.4%; B 0.01%: 15.8% vs 54.2%). Patients carrying deletion 17p13 (p53 mutation) showed a reduced ability to undergo apoptosis with respect to patients with other genomic aberrations or normal karyotype. The proapoptotic activity of Verbena officinalis essential oil and citral is thought to be due to a direct procaspase 3 activation. These data further support evidence that indicate natural compounds as a possible lead structure to develop new therapeutic agents.","['De Martino, L', ""D'Arena, G"", 'Minervini, M M', 'Deaglio, S', 'Fusco, B M', 'Cascavilla, N', 'De Feo, V']","['De Martino L', ""D'Arena G"", 'Minervini MM', 'Deaglio S', 'Fusco BM', 'Cascavilla N', 'De Feo V']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,"['0 (Acyclic Monoterpenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'T7EU0O9VPP (citral)']",IM,"['Acyclic Monoterpenes', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Components, Aerial', 'Plant Oils/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', '*Verbena/chemistry']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['26 [pii]', '10.1177/039463200902200426 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2009 Oct-Dec;22(4):1097-104. doi: 10.1177/039463200902200426.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are few studies concerning the expression of LIF and LIFR in normal and degenerating adult human brain. OBJECTIVES: To study the expression of LIF and LIFR in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and control brains. PATIENTS AND METHODS: LIF and LIFR mRNA copy numbers were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR from four brain regions of 34 patients with AD, 40 patients with PD, and 40 controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed in seven PD and in four AD patients and in seven normal controls. RESULTS: In general, the LIF copy numbers were 1 log higher than the LIFR copy numbers. In the AD brains, LIF expression was higher than in the controls in the hippocampus and in the temporal cortex, and in the PD brains in the hippocampus and in the anterior cingulated cortex. Expressions of LIF and LIFR in different brain regions were opposite except for the AD hippocampus and PD anterior cingulated cortex, where the expression patterns were parallel. CONCLUSIONS: Co-operative expression of LIF and LIFR in AD hippocampus and PD anterior cingulated cortex may indicate a role for LIF in neuronal damage or repair in these sites.","['Soilu-Hanninen, M', 'Broberg, E', 'Roytta, M', 'Mattila, P', 'Rinne, J', 'Hukkanen, V']","['Soilu-Hanninen M', 'Broberg E', 'Roytta M', 'Mattila P', 'Rinne J', 'Hukkanen V']","['Department of Neurology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. mersoi@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Acta Neurol Scand,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,0370336,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/*pathology', 'Brain/*pathology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gyrus Cinguli/pathology', 'Hippocampus/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Male', 'Parkinson Disease/*genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['ANE1179 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01179.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Neurol Scand. 2010 Jan;121(1):44-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01179.x.,10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01179.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the exceptionally variable histologic features of LC and the frequent nonleukemic dermatoses in leukemia patients, identification of leukemic cells that infiltrate skin lesions is important. Here, we introduce JL1, a novel leukemia-associated surface antigen, which is not expressed in mature human tissue but in cortical thymocytes and small subpopulations of bone marrow hematopoietic precursors. OBJECTIVES: To assess the expression pattern of JL1 in LC and compare it with other commonly used markers. Also, to evaluate the expression of JL1 in other cutaneous lesions that need differential diagnoses. DESIGN: Immunohistochemical staining with anti-JL1 and other commonly used markers for LC was performed on paraffin-embedded skin biopsies from 32 cases of LC with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia. Immunohistochemical staining score was evaluated in each case according to the proportion of positive tumor cells found. JL1 staining was also done on 96 reactive or neoplastic cutaneous lesions. RESULTS: JL1 was detected in 7 of 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma LC (63.6%) and 7 of 21 acute myelogenous leukemia LC (33.3%), with invariably high-staining scores. None of the other cutaneous lesions or normal tissues expressed JL1. The expression pattern of JL1 was not altered in 2 patients with follow-up biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that JL1 is expressed exclusively and stably by leukemic cells suggests that it can be used as a useful adjunctive marker for initial diagnosis and follow-up biopsy of LC, particularly in cases of scarce infiltrates.","['Park, Young Soo', 'Park, So Hyung', 'Park, Seo-Jeong', 'Kim, Youngji', 'Jang, Kee-Taek', 'Ko, Young Hyeh', 'Lee, Mi-Woo', 'Huh, Joo Ryung', 'Park, Chan-Sik']","['Park YS', 'Park SH', 'Park SJ', 'Kim Y', 'Jang KT', 'Ko YH', 'Lee MW', 'Huh JR', 'Park CS']","['Department of Pathology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (JL1 antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Diseases/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1043/2008-0699-OAR.1 [pii]', '10.5858/2008-0699-OAR.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2010 Jan;134(1):95-102. doi: 10.5858/2008-0699-OAR.1.,10.1043/2008-0699-OAR.1 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new and intense forms of radiation generated by nuclear reactor technology, and which would be released in the event of a nuclear war, created concerns about a public-health hazard unprecedented in form and scale. Fears of inadvertent exposure to acute and potentially lethal radiation launched a search for anti-radiation therapies, out of which emerged the new technique of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study analyzes the use of BMT first as a research tool to explore the biological effects of ionizing radiation, and then as an adjunct to radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In highlighting how BMT became the province of different research and clinical constituencies, this study develops an understanding of the forces and contingencies that shaped its development. Exploring the emergence of BMT and the uses to which it was put, it reveals that BMT remained a technique in the making -- unstable and far from standardized, even as it became both a widely used research tool and rapidly made its way into the clinic. More broadly, it casts new light on one route through which the Manhattan Project influenced postwar radiobiology; it also affords new insights into one means by which radiobiology came to serve the interests of the Cold War state. In its focus on BMT this paper provides a new perspective on the evolving relationship between radiobiology and biomedicine in the postwar period.","['Kraft, Alison']",['Kraft A'],"['Inst. for Science and Society, Univ. of Nottingham']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hist Stud Nat Sci,Historical studies in the natural sciences,101320234,,,"['Biomedical Research/education/history', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/education/ethnology/history/physiology/psychology', 'History, 20th Century', '*Leukemia/economics/ethnology/history/psychology', 'Medical Laboratory Personnel/education/history/psychology', 'Nuclear Medicine/economics/education/history', '*Nuclear Reactors/economics/history', 'Public Health/economics/education/history/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Public Health Practice/economics/history/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Radiobiology/education/history', '*Research Personnel/education/history/psychology', '*Stem Cells', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/economics/history/psychology']",2010/01/16 06:00,2010/04/01 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1525/hsns.2009.39.2.171 [doi]'],ppublish,Hist Stud Nat Sci. 2009 Spring;39(2):171-218. doi: 10.1525/hsns.2009.39.2.171.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epicenter of this controversy has been the validity of the linear non-threshold dose-response model, according to which any amount of radiation, however small, causes damage to human genes and health. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the nuclear scientist and medical researcher John Gofman (1918-2007) played a pivotal role in the debate. Historical accounts have treated Gofman as a radical antinuclear scientist whose unscientific arguments put enormous political pressure on the nuclear power industry and regulatory agencies. Gofman's bitter struggle with the Atomic Energy Commission, which funded his research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, partly accounts for this view. However, my analysis of Gofman's involvement in the low-level radiation debate shows how he also helped shift the focus in radiation safety from the risks of genetic damage or leukemia to somatic or cancer risks. His arguments led to the introduction of the linear non-threshold radiation model as a means of numerically estimating cancer risks. This was a watershed event in radiation-safety science and politics. Gofman's case sheds light on the process by which a scientist could secure legitimation even when his technical arguments threatened the government's interests. I conclude that it also points to an open issue in the history of antinuclear scientists, or of other politically active scientists or technology critics: treating them as critics should not preclude historians from treating them as scientists.","['Semendeferi, Ioanna']",['Semendeferi I'],"['Univ. of Houston, TX']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hist Stud Nat Sci,Historical studies in the natural sciences,101320234,,,"['*Biomedical Research/education/history', 'Causality', 'History, 20th Century', 'Linear Models', '*Neoplasms/ethnology/history', 'Nuclear Medicine/education/history', '*Public Opinion/history', '*Radiation Dosage', '*Research Personnel/education/history/psychology']",2008/04/01 00:00,2010/04/01 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1525/hsns.2008.38.2.259 [doi]'],ppublish,Hist Stud Nat Sci. 2008 Spring;38(2):259-301. doi: 10.1525/hsns.2008.38.2.259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased understanding of the surface expression profiles and interactions of membrane proteins on leukemia cells will facilitate the expansion of the role of antibodies in therapy and enable the identification of novel biomarkers for the various stages of leukemogenesis and leukemia progression. Proteomic analysis enables the identification of thousands of proteins in a membrane extract and provides information on their relative abundance, interactions and post-translational modifications. Plasma membrane proteome analysis of leukemia cells can be used to define biomarkers for diagnosis, classification, prognosis and progression monitoring, as well as to predict therapeutic response or resistance. The effects of chemotherapy on the surface proteome and the functional consequences of perturbations to membrane protein networks can provide insights into leukemia cell signaling and survival mechanisms. Surface proteins that are differentially expressed on leukemia cells are prospective targets for the development of engineered antibodies or small-molecule therapeutics.

The bcr-abl fusion gene product, a consecutively activated tyrosine kinase, which is crucial for the development of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), is highly sensitive to bosutinib. Interestingly, distinctly lower concentrations of the dual src/abl inhibitor are required to ablate Bcr-Abl phosphorylation when compared to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (IM). Bosutinib is a potent inhibitor of CML cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo experiments and has demonstrated promising harbouring results in CML patients resistance or intolerance to IM in ongoing phase I/II clinical trials. Remarkably, bosutinib has been found to be capable of overcoming the majority of IM-resistant bcr-abl mutations. A randomised open label phase III clinical study to compare the efficacy of bosutinib and IM in first-line therapy of Ph+ chronic phase (CP) CML has recently been initiated. In a phase I/II clinical study with subjects suffering from advanced stages of solid tumours, long-term responses have also been reported.

Changes in the chromatin environment of its promoter and binding of transcriptional factors have been reported in differentiating cells when its transcription is repressed. However, it is not clear whether these changes are directly involved in this repression or only linked to differentiation. In a maturation-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line (NB4-LR1), we have previously identified a new pathway of retinoid-induced hTERT repression independent of differentiation. Using a variant of this cell line (NB4-LR1(SFD)), which resists to this repression, we show that although distinct patterns of histone modifications and transcription factor binding at the proximal domain of hTERT gene promoter could concur to modulate its expression, this region is not sufficient to the on/off switch of hTERT by retinoids. DNA methylation analysis of the hTERT promoter led to the identification of two distinct functional domains, a proximal one, fully unmethylated in both cell lines, and a distal one, significantly methylated in NB4-LR1(SFD) cells, whose methylation was further re-enforced by retinoid treatment. Interestingly, we showed that the binding to this distal domain of a known hTERT repressor, WT1, was defective only in NB4-LR1(SFD) cells. We propose that epigenetic modifications targeting this distal region could modulate the binding of hTERT repressors and account either for hTERT reactivation and resistance to retinoid-induced hTERT downregulation.","['Azouz, A', 'Wu, Y-L', 'Hillion, J', 'Tarkanyi, I', 'Karniguian, A', 'Aradi, J', 'Lanotte, M', 'Chen, G-Q', 'Chehna, M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, E']","['Azouz A', 'Wu YL', 'Hillion J', 'Tarkanyi I', 'Karniguian A', 'Aradi J', 'Lanotte M', 'Chen GQ', 'Chehna M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['INSERM UMR-S 1007, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MAD1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genes, myc', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009283 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.283 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):613-22. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.283.

The molecular basis of the response to chemotherapy is still being analyzed. The proteinase 3 (PR3) gene codes for a serine protease with a broad spectrum of proteolytic activity. PR3 is involved in the control of proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells, and when it is abnormally expressed, it confers factor-independent growth to hematopoietic cells. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of PR3 in 113 AML patients. PR3 is highly expressed in AML, mainly in CBF leukemias in which PR3 is not only expressed, but also abnormally localized within the nuclear compartment. Nuclear PR3 results in cleavage of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 into an inactive p56 subunit lacking any transcriptional activity. The nuclear localization of PR3 is responsible for increased proliferation, apoptosis arrest and increased sensitivity to high-dose ARA-C. This study provides a new molecular mechanism that is responsible for NF-kappaB inactivation and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in CBF leukemias.Leukemia advance online publication, 14 January 2010; doi:10.1038/leu.2009.207.","['Cilloni, D', 'Carturan, S', 'Maffe, C', 'Messa, F', 'Arruga, F', 'Messa, E', 'Pradotto, M', 'Pautasso, M', 'Zanone, C', 'Fornaciari, P', 'Defilippi, I', 'Rotolo, A', 'Greco, E', 'Iacobucci, I', 'Martinelli, G', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Bracco, E', 'Saglio, G']","['Cilloni D', 'Carturan S', 'Maffe C', 'Messa F', 'Arruga F', 'Messa E', 'Pradotto M', 'Pautasso M', 'Zanone C', 'Fornaciari P', 'Defilippi I', 'Rotolo A', 'Greco E', 'Iacobucci I', 'Martinelli G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Bracco E', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2010/01/15 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009207 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.207 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Leukemia. 2010 Jan 14. pii: leu2009207. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.207.,,20100114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proviral integration-mediated elevated expression of the meningioma 1 (MN1) oncogene suggested MN1 acting as cooperating event in mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL) and eleven nineteen leukemia (ENL)-induced murine leukemia. Indeed, co-expression of MN1 with MLL-ENL enhanced transformation in vivo, and resulted in a significantly reduced latency for induction of an aggressive acute leukemia when compared with MN1 or MLL-ENL alone. In addition, co-expression of MN1 increased the granulocyte macrophage progenitor cell population with leukemia-initiating properties as shown in secondary transplantation experiments. Gene expression profiling experiments identified putative downstream MN1 targets, of which FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and CD34 were upregulated in both MN1-overexpressing murine leukemias and in pediatric acute leukemias with high MN1 levels. Interestingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated MN1 knockdown resulted in cell cycle arrest and impaired clonogenic growth of human leukemia cell lines with high MN1 levels. Our work shows for the first time that high MN1 levels are important for the growth of leukemic cells, and that increased MN1 expression can synergize with MLL-ENL and probably other transforming fusion genes in leukemia induction through a distinct gene expression program that is able to expand the leukemia-initiating cell population.","['Liu, T', 'Jankovic, D', 'Brault, L', 'Ehret, S', 'Baty, F', 'Stavropoulou, V', 'Rossi, V', 'Biondi, A', 'Schwaller, J']","['Liu T', 'Jankovic D', 'Brault L', 'Ehret S', 'Baty F', 'Stavropoulou V', 'Rossi V', 'Biondi A', 'Schwaller J']","['Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009272 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.272 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):601-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.272.

The regulation of its expression and biological roles remain greatly elusive. Here, we provide the first demonstration that onzin expression is significantly downregulated during differentiation induction of acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines and primary cells by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and especially by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Applying chemical inhibitions, RNA interferences, and transfected expressions of dominant negative mutants or constitutive catalytic forms of the related kinases, we show that protein kinase C-epsilon (PKCepsilon)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) signaling axis is required for PMA-induced downregulation of onzin expression. The ectopic expression of onzin partially inhibits PMA-induced monocytic differentiation of AML cells, whereas suppression of onzin by specific short hairpin RNAs enhances PMA-induced differentiation to a degree. Furthermore, onzin partially inhibits the transcriptional activity of hematopoiesis-related important transcription factor PU.1 via their interaction. Taken together, our results show that PMA downregulates onzin expression through PKCepsilon-ERK2 signaling pathway, which favors monocytic differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Wu, S-F', 'Huang, Y', 'Hou, J-K', 'Yuan, T-T', 'Zhou, C-X', 'Zhang, J', 'Chen, G-Q']","['Wu SF', 'Huang Y', 'Hou JK', 'Yuan TT', 'Zhou CX', 'Zhang J', 'Chen GQ']","['Institute of Health Science, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences-Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (PLAC8 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon/*physiology', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009280 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.280 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):544-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.280.

Cells with this phenotype have increased resistance to many cytotoxic agents, and may represent a primary drug-resistant population in malignant diseases. To discover whether drug-resistant malignant SP cells are nonetheless sensitive to immune-mediated killing, we first established the presence of a malignant CD5(+)CD19(+) SP subset in the blood of 18/21 subjects with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We examined the fate of these cells in six of these individuals who received autologous human CD40 ligand and interleukin-2 (hCD40L/IL-2) gene-modified tumor cells as part of a tumor vaccine study. Vaccinated patients showed an increase in B-CLL-reactive T cells followed by a corresponding decline in circulating CD5(+)CD19(+) SP cells. T-cell lines and clones generated from vaccinated patients specifically recognized B-CLL SP tumor cells. Elimination of SP cells is likely triggered by their increased expression of target antigens, such as receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), after stimulation of the malignant cells by hCD40L, as CD8(+) RHAMM-specific T cells could be detected in the peripheral blood of immunized patients and were associated with the decline in B-CLL SP cells. Hence, malignant B cells with a primary drug-resistant phenotype can be targeted by T- cell-mediated effector activity after immunization of human subjects.","['Foster, A E', 'Okur, F V', 'Biagi, E', 'Lu, A', 'Dotti, G', 'Yvon, E', 'Savoldo, B', 'Carrum, G', 'Goodell, M A', 'Heslop, H E', 'Brenner, M K']","['Foster AE', 'Okur FV', 'Biagi E', 'Lu A', 'Dotti G', 'Yvon E', 'Savoldo B', 'Carrum G', 'Goodell MA', 'Heslop HE', 'Brenner MK']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA. aefoster@txccc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009281 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.281 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):563-72. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.281.

The causes of MDS remain poorly defined, but several studies have reported the NKT cell compartment of patients with MDS is deficient in number and functionally defective. In support of a central role for NKT cells, a pilot clinical study reported that lenalidomide (an approved treatment for MDS) increased NKT cell numbers in patients with MDS, and several in vitro studies showed lenalidomide specifically promoted NKT cell proliferation and cytokine production. We tested this in a much larger study and confirm a moderate in vitro augmentation of some NKT cell functions by lenalidomide, but find no impact on the NKT cell compartment of patients treated with lenalidomide, despite a consistently positive clinical response. We further show that the frequency and cytokine production of NKT cells is normal in patients with MDS before treatment and remains stable throughout 10 months of lenalidomide therapy. Collectively, our data challenge the concept that NKT cell defects contribute to the development of MDS, and show that a clinical response to lenalidomide is not dependent on modulation of NKT cell frequency or function.","['Chan, A C', 'Neeson, P', 'Leeansyah, E', 'Tainton, K', 'Quach, H', 'Prince, H M', 'Godfrey, D I', 'Ritchie, D', 'Berzins, S P']","['Chan AC', 'Neeson P', 'Leeansyah E', 'Tainton K', 'Quach H', 'Prince HM', 'Godfrey DI', 'Ritchie D', 'Berzins SP']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009279 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.279 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):592-600. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.279.

The antifolate methotrexate (MTX), a universal component of ALL therapies, is metabolized by folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) into long-chain polyglutamates (MTX-PG(3-7)), resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity from prolonged inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthetase (TS). Using DNaseI assays, we identified a hypersensitive site upstream from exon-1, suggesting chromatin remodeling could alter FPGS expression. We demonstrated that histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) is recruited by NFY and Sp1 transcription factors to the FPGS promoter in ALL cell lines. We examined the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) sodium butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on the expression of FPGS and other folate-related genes. HDACIs increased FPGS mRNA expression by 2- to 5-fold, whereas DHFR and TS mRNA expression was decreased. Combination treatment with MTX plus SAHA significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis in B- and T-ALL cell lines as compared with each drug alone (CI<or=0.8). SAHA increased the intracellular accumulation of long-chain MTX-PG(3-7). Therefore, HDACI-induced FPGS expression increases the accumulation of MTX-PG(3-7) and cytotoxicity in ALL cell lines, which is potentiated by DHFR and TS downregulation. The synergism exhibited by the combination of MTX and SAHA warrants clinical testing in ALL patients.","['Leclerc, G J', 'Mou, C', 'Leclerc, G M', 'Mian, A M', 'Barredo, J C']","['Leclerc GJ', 'Mou C', 'Leclerc GM', 'Mian AM', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101-6960, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NFYB protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/*genetics', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Vorinostat']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009282 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.282 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):552-62. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.282.

MSI was observed in 52% of allotransplanted patients but never in 31 healthy or autotransplanted controls. The patient age, the donor age, a female-to-male transplantation and a low number of CD34(+) cells in the graft were significantly correlated with genomic instability. There was a trend for increasing risk of MSI for patients who experienced severe graft-vs-host disease. Secondary malignancy was diagnosed in five (14%) of the MSI(+) and only in one (3%) MSI(-) patient. In an in vitro model of mutation analysis we found significant induction of frameshift mutations and DNA strand breaks in HaCaT keratinocytes co-cultured with mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLCs) but not after their exposure to interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), MLC supernatant, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMC.

Over a 15-year period, we identified 17 MDS patients with trisomy 11 either as a sole abnormality (n=10) or associated with one or two additional alterations (n=7), comprising 0.3% of all MDS cases reviewed. Of 16 patients with Bone Marrow material available for review, 14 (88%) patients presented with excess blasts, 69% patients evolved to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a 5-month median interval and the median survival was 14 months. For comparison, we studied 19 AML patients with trisomy 11 in a noncomplex karyotype, of which, a substantial subset of patients had morphologic dysplasia, and/or preexisting cytopenia(s)/MDS. Genomic DNA PCR showed MLL partial tandem duplication in 5 of 10 MDS and 7 of 11 AML patients. A review of literature identified 17 additional cases of MDS with trisomy 11, showing similar clinicopathologic features to our patients. Compared with our historical data comprising 1165 MDS patients, MDS patients with trisomy 11 had a significantly inferior survival to patients in the IPSS intermediate-risk cytogenetic group (P=0.0002), but comparable to the poor-risk group (P=0.97). We conclude that trisomy 11 in MDS correlates with clinical aggressiveness, may suggest an early/evolving AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and is best considered a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality in MDS prognostication.","['Wang, S A', 'Jabbar, K', 'Lu, G', 'Chen, S S', 'Galili, N', 'Vega, F', 'Jones, D', 'Raza, A', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'McDonnell, T J', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Wang SA', 'Jabbar K', 'Lu G', 'Chen SS', 'Galili N', 'Vega F', 'Jones D', 'Raza A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA. swang5@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Disorders/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Trisomy/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009289 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.289 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):740-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.289.

The biological mechanisms underlying therapy response and development of relapses have remained unclear. In an attempt to better understand this phenomenon, we have analyzed 41 matched diagnosis-relapse pairs of ALL patients using genome-wide expression arrays (82 arrays) on purified leukemic cells. In roughly half of the patients, very few differences between diagnosis and relapse samples were found ('stable group'), suggesting that mostly extra-leukemic factors (for example, drug distribution, drug metabolism, compliance) contributed to the relapse. Therefore, we focused our further analysis on 20 sample pairs with clear differences in gene expression ('skewed group'), reasoning that these would allow us to better study the biological mechanisms underlying relapsed ALL. After finding the differences between diagnosis and relapse pairs in this group, we identified four major gene clusters corresponding to several pathways associated with changes in cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination and repair, as well as B-cell developmental genes. We also identified cancer genes commonly associated with colon carcinomas and ubiquitination to be upregulated in relapsed ALL. Thus, about half of the relapses are due to the selection or emergence of a clone with deregulated expression of genes involved in pathways that regulate B-cell signaling, development, cell cycle, cellular division and replication.","['Staal, F J T', 'de Ridder, D', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Schonewille, T', 'van der Linden, E C E', 'van Wering, E R', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['Staal FJ', 'de Ridder D', 'Szczepanski T', 'Schonewille T', 'van der Linden EC', 'van Wering ER', 'van der Velden VH', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. f.j.t.staal@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009286 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.286 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):491-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.286.

The mTOR kinase functions in two complexes, TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2); however, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. We compared rapamycin with PP242, an inhibitor of the active site of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (hereafter referred to as TORC1/2), in models of acute leukemia harboring the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. We demonstrate that PP242, but not rapamycin, causes death of mouse and human leukemia cells. In vivo, PP242 delays leukemia onset and augments the effects of the current front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than does rapamycin. Unexpectedly, PP242 has much weaker effects than rapamycin on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes. PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is more immunosuppressive than PP242. These findings establish that Ph(+) transformed cells are more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors and support the development of such inhibitors for leukemia therapy.","['Janes, Matthew R', 'Limon, Jose J', 'So, Lomon', 'Chen, Jing', 'Lim, Raymond J', 'Chavez, Melissa A', 'Vu, Collin', 'Lilly, Michael B', 'Mallya, Sharmila', 'Ong, S Tiong', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Martin, Michael B', 'Ren, Pingda', 'Liu, Yi', 'Rommel, Christian', 'Fruman, David A']","['Janes MR', 'Limon JJ', 'So L', 'Chen J', 'Lim RJ', 'Chavez MA', 'Vu C', 'Lilly MB', 'Mallya S', 'Ong ST', 'Konopleva M', 'Martin MB', 'Ren P', 'Liu Y', 'Rommel C', 'Fruman DA']","['Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, Institute for Immunology, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CRTC1 protein, human)', '0 (CRTC2 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2009/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2091 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2091 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2010 Feb;16(2):205-13. doi: 10.1038/nm.2091.

Though transplant recipients likely represent a highly selected population, current studies do not demonstrate an upper age for transplantation and suggest that myeloablative regimens may be considered in older patients with limited comorbidities. Avenues being pursued to improve transplant outcomes include natural killer cell immunotherapy and regulatory T-cell modulation.

However, in about 50% of patients, clinical resistance so far cannot be linked to known mutations. Mutation-independent resistance development is imparted by a multifactorial array of mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent publications on molecular mechanisms that govern the development of clinical resistance. Studies on the second-line inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib addressing clinical efficacy in the presence of preexisting kinase mutations have largely confirmed the in-vitro prediction. With regard to mutation-independent resistance, new insights into the multifactorial resistance regulation were gained. Preclinical and clinical findings have revitalized the interest in interferon-alpha as a potentially useful adjunct for tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based treatment. The dogma of continuous kinase inhibition necessary for optimal efficacy has been challenged by clinical and preclinical data. SUMMARY: Elucidation of the complexity of resistance development most likely will help to preempt evolution of resistant disease. Clinical studies now focus on dose modifications, drug scheduling, optimized inhibitors, and drug combinations aiming to prevent resistance development.","['La Rosee, Paul', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['La Rosee P', 'Hochhaus A']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366be1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Mar;17(2):91-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366be1.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366be1 [doi],,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: The revised 2008 WHO classification recognizes both molecularly defined ('myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1') and undefined (chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified) eosinophilic myeloid disorders. An increasingly sophisticated understanding of the molecular underpinnings of eosinophilia has translated into rational use of biologically targeted therapies such as imatinib mesylate. Conventional cytotoxics and interferon-alpha still have an established role in treating these diseases. Although studied in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, the therapeutic niche of anti-interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) antibody therapy in eosinophilic myeloid diseases has yet to be established. SUMMARY: Molecular/genetic analysis is now mandatory for the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of eosinophilic myeloid disorders.

Genetic polymorphisms of this enzyme have been shown to impact several diseases, including cancer. Leukemias are malignancies arising from rapidly proliferating hematopoietic cells having great requirement of DNA synthesis. This case-control study was undertaken to analyze the association of the MTHFR gene polymorphisms 677 C""T and 1298 A""C and the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients aged below 15 years with a confirmed diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 99 matched controls were taken for this study. Analysis of the polymorphisms was done using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: Frequency of MTHFR 677 CC and CT were 85.9% and 14.1% in the controls, and 84.9% and 15.1% in the cases. The 'T' allele frequency was 7% and 7.5% in cases and controls respectively. The frequency of MTHFR 1298 AA, AC, and CC were 28.3%, 55.6% and 16.1% for controls and 23.3%, 59.3% and 17.4% for cases respectively. The 'C' allele frequency for 1298 A-->C was 43.9% and 47% respectively for controls and cases. The odds ratio (OR) for C677T was 1.08 (95% CI 0.48-2.45, p = 0.851) and OR for A1298C was 1.29 (95% CI 0.65-2.29, p = 0.46) and OR for 1298 CC was 1.31 (95% CI 0.53-3.26, p = 0.56). The OR for the combined heterozygous status (677 CT and 1298 AC) was 1.94 (95% CI 0.58-6.52, p = 0.286). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 'T' allele for 677 MTHFR polymorphism was low in the population studied. There was no association between MTHFR 677 C-->T and 1298 A-->C gene polymorphisms and risk of ALL, which may be due to the small sample size.","['Sadananda Adiga, M N', 'Chandy, S', 'Ramachandra, N', 'Appaji, L', 'Aruna Kumari, B S', 'Ramaswamy, G', 'Savithri, H S', 'Krishnamoorthy, L']","['Sadananda Adiga MN', 'Chandy S', 'Ramachandra N', 'Appaji L', 'Aruna Kumari BS', 'Ramaswamy G', 'Savithri HS', 'Krishnamoorthy L']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Dr. M.

Twist, a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a newly identified oncogene. However, there are no reports on Twist expression in ATL. To define the role of Twist in leukemogenesis of ATL, we examined its expression in T-cell lines and PBMC. HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells expressed high levels of Twist compared with uninfected T-cell lines and normal PBMC. Immunohistochemistry showed immunostaining for Twist in ATL cells in ATL lymph nodes and skin lesions. Infection of normal PBMC with HTLV-1 induced Twist expression. Induction of the viral protein Tax in a human T-cell line led to upregulation of Twist. Tax-induced Twist expression involved the NF-kappaB and CREB signaling pathways. Twist augmented Tax-mediated HTLV-1 LTR and NF-kappaB activation. Short interfering RNA against Twist inhibited cell growth of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and downregulation of Twist expression in an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line inhibited the expression of Akt1, interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, and Tax as well as the known target genes of Twist, YB-1 and Akt2. In conclusion, the results suggest that Tax-induced induction of Twist contributes to leukemogenesis of ATL.","['Tanji, Hiroe', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Sawada, Shigeki', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Takamatsu, Reika', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Uchihara, Jun-Nosuke', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Uezato, Hiroshi', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Wu, Kou-Juey', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Tanji H', 'Ishikawa C', 'Sawada S', 'Nakachi S', 'Takamatsu R', 'Matsuda T', 'Okudaira T', 'Uchihara JN', 'Ohshiro K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Senba M', 'Uezato H', 'Ohshima K', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Wu KJ', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2010/01/15 06:00,2010/01/15 06:01,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['blood-2009-07-232231 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-232231 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 13. pii: blood-2009-07-232231. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-232231.

We previously reported that miR-15/16 is a target of 13q14 deletions and plays a tumor suppressor role by targeting BCL2. Because DLEU7 is located near miR-15/16 and is also positioned within a minimal deleted region, we investigated whether DLEU7 could also play a tumor suppressor role. Recent studies of transgenic mouse models demonstrated the importance of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway in CLL. To examine the possible role of DLEU7 in CLL, we investigated the effect of DLEU7 expression on NF-kappaB and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity. We found that DLEU7 functions as a potent NF-kappaB and NFAT inhibitor by physically interacting and inhibiting TACI and BCMA, members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family involved in B-CLL. In addition, DLEU7 expression in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a decrease in S phase and increased apoptosis. The results suggest that loss of DLEU7 may cooperate with the loss of miR-15/16 in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Palamarchuk, Alexey', 'Efanov, Alexey', 'Nazaryan, Natalya', 'Santanam, Urmila', 'Alder, Hansjuerg', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Kipps, Thomas', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Pekarsky, Yuri']","['Palamarchuk A', 'Efanov A', 'Nazaryan N', 'Santanam U', 'Alder H', 'Rassenti L', 'Kipps T', 'Croce CM', 'Pekarsky Y']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (DLEU7 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF13B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'S Phase', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35027-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-249367 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 May 13;115(19):3916-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-249367.

A total of 7 patients with recurrent leukemia after major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic HCT were treated with infusions of donor-derived, ex vivo-expanded CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for tissue-restricted recipient mHAgs. The safety of T-cell therapy, in vivo persistence of transferred CTLs, and disease response were assessed. Molecular characterization of the mHAgs recognized by CTL clones administered to 3 patients was performed to provide insight into the antileukemic activity and safety of T-cell therapy. Pulmonary toxicity of CTL infusion was seen in 3 patients, was severe in 1 patient, and correlated with the level of expression of the mHAg-encoding genes in lung tissue. Adoptively transferred CTLs persisted in the blood up to 21 days after infusion, and 5 patients achieved complete but transient remissions after therapy. The results of these studies illustrate the potential to selectively enhance graft-versus-leukemia activity by the adoptive transfer of mHAg-specific T-cell clones and the challenges for the broad application of this approach in allogeneic HCT.

One marked characteristic of HL60 cells is the c-MYC proto-oncogene amplification, resulting in the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) at 8p24. We conducted a fluorescence in situ hybridization study in an HL60 cell line, using a locus-specific probe for c-MYC, before and after treatment with pisosterol (at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8 microg/mL), a triterpene isolated from the fungus Pisolithus tinctorius. Before treatment, 87.5% of the cells showed HSRs. After treatment, no effects were detected at lower concentrations of pisosterol (0.5 and 1.0 microg/mL). However, at 1.8 microg/mL only 15% of the cells presented HSRs, and 39.5% presented few fluorescent signals (3 or 4 alleles), suggesting that pisosterol probably blocks the cells with HSRs at interphase. This result is particularly interesting because cells that do not show a high degree of c-MYC gene amplification have a less aggressive and invasive behaviour and are easy targets for chemotherapy. Therefore, further studies are needed to examine the use of pisosterol in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapy.","['Silva, T C R', 'Lima, P D L', 'Bahia, M O', 'Khayat, A S', 'Bezerra, F S', 'Andrade-Neto, M', 'Seabra, A D', 'Pontes, T B', 'Moraes, M O', 'Montenegro, R C', 'Costa-Lotufo, L V', 'Pessoa, C', 'Pinto, G R', 'Burbano, R R']","['Silva TC', 'Lima PD', 'Bahia MO', 'Khayat AS', 'Bezerra FS', 'Andrade-Neto M', 'Seabra AD', 'Pontes TB', 'Moraes MO', 'Montenegro RC', 'Costa-Lotufo LV', 'Pessoa C', 'Pinto GR', 'Burbano RR']","['Human Cytogenetics Laboratory, Institute of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Para, Belem/PA, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (pisosterol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Interphase', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['0960327109359637 [pii]', '10.1177/0960327109359637 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2010 Mar;29(3):235-40. doi: 10.1177/0960327109359637.

In addition, Klf4 seems to play a redundant role along with other Klf family proteins in embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal. However, how Klf4 regulates ES cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming is still poorly understood. Here we report that Klf4 is required for both ES cell self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency and that the expression of Klf4 prevents ES cell differentiation in response to withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). In addition, Klf4 directly binds to the promoter region of Nanog and regulates its expression. Expression of Nanog prevents ES cell differentiation even when Klf4 gene expression is knocked down. On the other hand, knockdown of Nanog expression induces differentiation of ES cells that overexpress Klf4.

The age-standardized yearly incidence rates regarding the total number of de novo AL was 5.3/100000 inhabitant for Estonia and 8.0 for Sweden, this difference being statistically significant merely as regards acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The relative survival for the total cohort of de novo AL as well as for de novo AML was significantly longer (p<0.001) for Swedish as compared to Estonian patients. METHODS: In view of the miserable outcome for the Estonian patients we decided to prospectively compare the results for incidence and outcome of de novo AL between the two countries. RESULTS: The present report covers the first 5-year period comprising 1997-2001 and deals only with patients aged >or=65 years at diagnosis. The age-adjusted annual incidence rates for de novo AML were lower in Estonia (6.4/100000) than in Sweden (9.2/100000) but not significantly so. The present results also show that the outcome for the Estonian AML patients had improved considerably over the study period; thus, at no time point, i.e., at 1, 3 and 5 years did relative survival between the two countries differ significantly. CONCLUSION: Yet, as compared to the Swedish cohort relative survival for the Estonian patients did still not reach an acceptable level.","['Palk, Katrin', 'Luik, Ene', 'Varik, Mirja', 'Viigimaa, Iige', 'Vaht, Krista', 'Everaus, Hele', 'Wennstrom, Lovisa', 'Stockelberg, Dick', 'Safai-Kutti, Soodabeh', 'Holmberg, Erik', 'Kutti, Jack']","['Palk K', 'Luik E', 'Varik M', 'Viigimaa I', 'Vaht K', 'Everaus H', 'Wennstrom L', 'Stockelberg D', 'Safai-Kutti S', 'Holmberg E', 'Kutti J']","['Department of Hematology, North Estonian Regional Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Data Collection', 'Estonia/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(09)00183-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2009.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2010 Feb;34(1):24-8. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.12.004.

We have investigated the effects of the multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib alone or in combination with TRAIL and agonistic Fas antibodies on endometrial carcinoma cells. We have also focused on the search of the differential molecular mechanisms by which Sorafenib induces cell death and the ones involved in sensitisation to TRAIL. In the present study, we show that Sorafenib induces apoptosis of both endometrial cancer cell lines and human primary cultures and sensitises these cells to TRAIL and agonistic Fas antibodies (aFas)-induced apoptosis. However, Raf/MEK/ERK inhibition by Sorafenib was not responsible for Sorafenib cell death or TRAIL sensitisation of endometrial cancer cells. Sorafenib treatment correlated with a downregulation of both FLICE-Inhibitory Protein (FLIP) and myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1), caused by a proteasomal degradation of both proteins. We evaluated the contribution of FLIP and Mcl-1 downregulation in apoptosis triggered by Sorafenib alone or Sorafenib plus TRAIL. Interestingly, cell death caused by Sorafenib was mediated by downregulation of Mcl-1, but not by FLIP. In contrast, we found that Sorafenib sensitisation of endometrial carcinoma cells to TRAIL- and Fas-induced apoptosis was dependent on FLIP but not on Mcl-1 downregulation. Altogether, we discern the dual mechanisms by which Sorafenib causes cell death from those involved in death receptor sensitisation.","['Llobet, D', 'Eritja, N', 'Yeramian, A', 'Pallares, J', 'Sorolla, A', 'Domingo, M', 'Santacana, M', 'Gonzalez-Tallada, F J', 'Matias-Guiu, X', 'Dolcet, X']","['Llobet D', 'Eritja N', 'Yeramian A', 'Pallares J', 'Sorolla A', 'Domingo M', 'Santacana M', 'Gonzalez-Tallada FJ', 'Matias-Guiu X', 'Dolcet X']","['Oncologic Pathology Group, Department of Pathology and Molecular Genetics, Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova-Department de Ciencias Mediques Basiques, Univeristat de Lleida, Institut de Recerca Biomedica de Lleida, IRBLleida, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/04/10 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00956-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.12.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Mar;46(4):836-50. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.12.025.

We have investigated the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and p38] and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways in the differentiated phenotypes of K562 cells promoted by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, staurosporine (STA), and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190. In our experimental conditions, only STA-treated cells showed the phenotype of mature megakaryocytes (MKs) including GPIbalpha expression, DNA endoreduplication, and formation of platelet-like structures. We provide evidence supporting that basal activity, but not sustained activation, of ERK1/2 is required for expression of MK surface markers. Moreover, ERK1/2 signaling is not involved in cell endomitosis. The PI3K pathway exerts dual regulatory effects on K562 cell differentiation: it is intimately connected with ERK1/2 cascade to stimulate expression of surface markers and it is also necessary, but not sufficient, for polyploidization. Finally, apoptosis and megakaryocytic differentiation exhibit different sensitivity to p38 down-regulation: it is required for expression of early specific markers but is not involved in cell apoptosis. The present work with K562 cells provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating MK differentiation. The results indicate that a precise orchestration of signals, including ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs as well as PI3K pathway, is necessary for acquisition of features of mature MKs.","['Conde, Isabel', 'Pabon, Dina', 'Jayo, Asier', 'Lastres, Pedro', 'Gonzalez-Manchon, Consuelo']","['Conde I', 'Pabon D', 'Jayo A', 'Lastres P', 'Gonzalez-Manchon C']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1416 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01416.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 May;84(5):430-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01416.x.

We found the results from healthy cattle in 2001 differed from those in many ways. Discovery of the original laboratory book used to calculate the 1965 values gave us the opportunity to evaluate whether hematology values of healthy cattle have changed over time. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish hematology reference intervals for Holstein cows, compare selected hematologic results with similar population data from 1957, and compare these reference intervals with those of other North American veterinary schools and published values. METHODS: Reference intervals were developed in 2001 using clinically healthy, bovine leukemia virus-negative, mid-lactation Holstein cows. Selected parts of the hemograms and neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio were compared with those from healthy, age-matched Holstein cows evaluated in 1957. Bovine reference intervals were solicited from clinical pathology laboratories in North American veterinary colleges and analyzed for population characteristics and method of analysis. RESULTS: Between 1957 and 2001, mean neutrophil counts increased significantly, whereas lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts and hemoglobin concentration decreased significantly. Mean N:L ratio increased significantly to 1.17. Most surveyed laboratories were using the 1965 reference intervals. Two other institutions that had developed reference intervals after 2000 had results similar to ours. CONCLUSIONS: Continued use of older bovine hematology reference intervals could lead to misinterpretation of within-reference neutrophil counts as neutrophilia and under-recognition of neutropenia, eosinophilia, monocytosis, or lymphocytosis. Use of N:L>1 as evidence of inflammation should be discontinued or used with great caution.","['George, Jeanne W', 'Snipes, Joy', 'Lane, V Michael']","['George JW', 'Snipes J', 'Lane VM']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA. jwgeorge@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle/*blood', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/veterinary', 'Female', '*Hematology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Lymphocyte Count/veterinary', '*Reference Standards', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['VCP208 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-165X.2009.00208.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2010 Jun;39(2):138-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165X.2009.00208.x.

Transfusing donor neutrophils is a logical approach to these problems, but granulocyte transfusion (GTx), a practice first advocated in the 1960s, is underused and although now enjoying resurgence, remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the practical aspects of GTx and clinical responses in patients receiving them. This is an observational retrospective review of GTx in patients undergoing therapy for predominantly haematological malignancies. We reviewed blood bank records and identified patients who received therapeutic granulocytes procured by leukapheresis and linked these recipients with their granulocyte donors. We determined the reasons for GTx and their clinical and relevant haematological responses to the transfusions. We identified 22 patients receiving at least three continuous days of GTx and who had adequate clinical and haematological data. Most donors were relatives and ABO matched with their respective recipients. Mean age of the patients was 28.8 years. Severe aplastic anaemia was the most common diagnosis, occurring in 9 patients (40.9%), followed by acute myeloid leukaemia in 6 (27.3%). Disseminated fungal infection was the most common reason for GTx, occurring in 16 patients (73%), followed by febrile neutropaenia in 7 patients. Fifteen (68.2%) patients showed clinical improvement. This uncontrolled retrospective observational study provides some evidence that procurement and use of GTx is safe for both donors and recipients and is probably an effective supportive therapy for patients with febrile neutropaenia.","['Al-Tanbal, H', 'Al Humaidan, H', 'Al-Nounou, R', 'Roberts, G', 'Tesfamichael, K', 'Owaidah, T']","['Al-Tanbal H', 'Al Humaidan H', 'Al-Nounou R', 'Roberts G', 'Tesfamichael K', 'Owaidah T']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood Donors', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Leukocyte Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/etiology/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['TME988 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00988.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Med. 2010 Jun;20(3):160-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00988.x.

METHODS: Haematology, Coombs' testing (including assessment of persistent autoagglutination) and selected infection testing (haemoplasma, feline leukaemia virus/feline immunodeficiency virus provirus) were performed in blood samples collected from 60 anaemic and 60 non-anaemic cats. RESULTS: No association between infection and anaemia or Coombs' positivity existed. Anaemic cats (21.7%) were significantly more likely than non-anaemic cats (0%) to have cold autoagglutination (P<0.0001), but significance (set at <or=0.0025 due to multiple testing) was not quite reached when Coombs' positivity was compared between anaemic (40.4% and 21.7% positive at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively) and non-anaemic (20% and 3.3% positive, P=0.021 and P=0.004, at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively) cats. Cats with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia were significantly more likely to have persistent cold autoagglutination (P<0.0001) and be Coombs' positive at 37 degrees C with polyvalent (P<0.0001), immunoglobulin (Ig)G (P<0.0001) or any antiserum (P<0.0001). Haemoplasmas and retroviruses were uncommonly detected. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Cats suspected of having immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia should be evaluated for persistent autoagglutination at 4 degrees C as well as performing Coombs' testing at 37 degrees C, but positive results may occur in with other forms of anaemia. Testing for erythrocyte-bound antibodies should always be interpreted in parallel with documentation of haemolysis in anaemic cats.","['Tasker, S', 'Murray, J K', 'Knowles, T G', 'Day, M J']","['Tasker S', 'Murray JK', 'Knowles TG', 'Day MJ']","['School of Clinical Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, Langford, Bristol BS40 5DU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Small Anim Pract,The Journal of small animal practice,0165053,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/diagnosis/microbiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/analysis', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/microbiology/virology', 'Cats', 'Coombs Test/*veterinary', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Mycoplasma/immunology', 'Retroviridae/immunology']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/07/06 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JSAP869 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00869.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Small Anim Pract. 2010 Apr;51(4):192-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00869.x.

Evidence for an association with childhood leukemia is growing. Exposure to benzene can lead to multiple alterations that contribute to the leukemogenic process, indicating a multimodal mechanism of action. Research is needed to elucidate the different roles of multiple metabolites in benzene toxicity and the pathways that lead to their formation. Studies to date have identified a number of polymorphisms in candidate genes that confer susceptibility to benzene hematotoxicity. However, a genome-wide study is needed to truly assess the role of genetic variation in susceptibility. Benzene affects the blood-forming system at low levels of occupational exposure, and there is no evidence of a threshold. There is probably no safe level of exposure to benzene, and all exposures constitute some risk in a linear, if not supralinear, and additive fashion.","['Smith, Martyn T']",['Smith MT'],"['Superfund Research Program, Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7356, USA. martynts@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Public Health,Annual review of public health,8006431,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/metabolism', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/metabolism']",2010/01/15 06:00,2010/06/26 06:00,['2010/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103646 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Public Health. 2010;31:133-48 2 p following 148. doi: 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103646.,10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103646 [doi],,129,,,"['R01ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES006721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54ES01611/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4360999,,,['NIHMS668017'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether changes in histone signature influence the nuclear arrangement and positioning of telomeres. Analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed that telomeres were organized into specific clusters that partially associated with centromeric clusters. This nuclear arrangement was influenced by deficiency of the histone methyltransferase SUV39h, LMNA deficiency, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). Similarly, nuclear radial distributions of telomeric clusters were preferentially influenced by TSA, which caused relocation of telomeres closer to the nuclear center. Telomeres also co-localized with promyelocytic leukemia bodies (PML). This association was increased by SUV39h deficiency and decreased by LMNA deficiency. These differences could be explained by differing levels of the telomerase subunit, TERT, in SUV39h- and LMNA-deficient fibroblasts.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center, unmatched case-control study. Fifty-three VRE-colonized, high-risk patients with neutropenic fever were identified between January 2006 and February 2009. The two most common diagnoses/conditions included acute myeloid leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Data collected included days of neutropenia, days of fever, demographic data, culture results, and antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Twenty of the 53 patients (38%) with VRE colonization developed a VRE infection. The most common VRE infections were bacteremias (26%). The presence of neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days was associated with the development of VRE infection in this high-risk population colonized with VRE. The timeframe to develop VRE infection varied from 1 day to 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: For patients colonized with VRE, approximately 38% of high-risk neutropenic patients developed a VRE infection. This is the first study to specifically evaluate the incidence of VRE infections in febrile neutropenic patients colonized with VRE.

HTLV-1, the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia, encodes Tax1 with PBM as a transforming protein. The Tax1 PBM was substituted with those from other oncoviruses, and the transforming activity was examined. Tax1 mutants with PBM from either HPV-16 E6 or adenovirus type 9 E4ORF1 are fully active in the transformation of a mouse T-cell line from interleukin-2-dependent growth into independent growth. Interestingly, one such Tax1 PBM mutant had an extra amino acid insertion derived from E6 between PBM and the rest of Tax1, thus suggesting that the amino acid sequences of the peptides between PBM and the rest of Tax1 and the numbers only slightly affect the function of PBM in the transformation. Tax1 and Tax1 PBM mutants interacted with tumor suppressors Dlg1 and Scribble with PDZ-domains. Unlike E6, Tax1 PBM mutants as well as Tax1 did not or minimally induced the degradations of Dlg1 and Scribble, but instead induced their subcellular translocation from the detergent-soluble fraction into the insoluble fraction, thus suggesting that the inactivation mechanism of these tumor suppressor proteins is distinct. The present results suggest that PBMs of high-risk oncoviruses have a common function(s) required for these three tumor viruses to transform cells, which is likely associated with the subtype-specific oncogenesis of these tumor viruses.","['Aoyagi, Tomoya', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Kiyono, Tohru', 'Aoyagi, Yutaka', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Aoyagi T', 'Takahashi M', 'Higuchi M', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Kiyono T', 'Aoyagi Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein)', '0 (Dlg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (E4 protein, Adenovirus 9)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SAP90-PSD95 Associated Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (scribble protein, mouse)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'SAP90-PSD95 Associated Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2009/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11262-009-0447-x [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2010 Apr;40(2):193-9. doi: 10.1007/s11262-009-0447-x.,10.1007/s11262-009-0447-x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been 29 cases of lymphoma induced lactic acidosis reported thus far; however all reported cases have abnormal vital signs or concomitant medical conditions that may lead to lactic acidosis. The pathogenesis of malignancy-induced lactic acidosis is not well understood; however associated factors include increased glycolysis, increased lactate production by cancer cells, and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. When it occurs, lactic acidosis is a poor prognostic sign in these patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of underlying lymphoma or leukemia remains the only way to achieve complete resolution of lactic acidosis in these patients.","['Chan, Farn Huei', 'Carl, Daniel', 'Lyckholm, Laurel J']","['Chan FH', 'Carl D', 'Lyckholm LJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Case Rep Med,Case reports in medicine,101512910,,,,2010/01/14 06:00,2010/01/14 06:01,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/534561 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Med. 2009;2009:534561. doi: 10.1155/2009/534561.

The neuropoietic cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is expressed in MS lesions, but its effect on lesion development is far from understood. LIF is an interesting candidate for MS therapy, as it has neuroprotective properties and may also promote the survival of myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLGs). However, therapeutic administration of LIF is complicated by its limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its pleiotropic actions outside the CNS. In this study, lentiviral vectors (LVs) were used to achieve stable expression and secretion of LIF in the CNS of adult mice. CNS-targeted expression of LIF significantly reduced demyelination in a murine model of MS. In addition, local expression of LIF ameliorated clinical symptoms with enhanced efficacy compared to systemic treatment with recombinant protein. These findings demonstrate that gene therapeutic administration of LIF is a promising approach to limit lesion burden and clinical symptoms in neuroinflammatory disease.","['Slaets, Helena', 'Hendriks, Jerome J A', 'Van den Haute, Chris', 'Coun, Frea', 'Baekelandt, Veerle', 'Stinissen, Piet', 'Hellings, Niels']","['Slaets H', 'Hendriks JJ', 'Van den Haute C', 'Coun F', 'Baekelandt V', 'Stinissen P', 'Hellings N']","['Hasselt University, Biomedical Research Institute and transnationale Universiteit Limburg, School of Life Sciences, Diepenbeek, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism', 'Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases, CNS/therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*therapy', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Lentivirus', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*therapy', 'Oligodendroglia/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32324-3 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2009.311 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2010 Apr;18(4):684-91. doi: 10.1038/mt.2009.311.

MRI T1 images showed a low intensity area, T2 images showed a high intensity area and Gd-DTPA-enhanced images showed a high intensity area at the S1-2 disk space. Clinical findings and MRI findings suggested pyogenic spondylitis. Back pain improved gradually after conservative treatment with meropenem (MEPM) for two weeks.

We, therefore, examined chromosomal abnormalities by high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in 88 MPN patients, as well as 71 cases with MPN-blast phase, and correlated these findings with their clinical parameters. Frequent genomic alterations were found in MPN after leukemic transformation with up to 3-fold more genomic changes per sample compared with samples in chronic phase (P < .001). We identified commonly altered regions involved in disease progression including not only established targets (ETV6, TP53, and RUNX1) but also new candidate genes on 7q, 16q, 19p, and 21q. Moreover, trisomy 8 or amplification of 8q24 (MYC) was almost exclusively detected in JAK2V617F(-) cases with MPN-blast phase. Remarkably, copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) on either 7q or 9p including homozygous JAK2V617F was related to decreased survival after leukemic transformation (P = .01 and P = .016, respectively). Our high-density SNP-array analysis of MPN genomes in the chronic compared with leukemic stage identified novel target genes and provided prognostic insights associated with the evolution to leukemia.","['Thoennissen, Nils H', 'Krug, Utz O', 'Lee, Dhong Hyun Tony', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Iwanski, Gabriela B', 'Lasho, Terra', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Raynaud, Sophie D', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Thoennissen NH', 'Krug UO', 'Lee DH', 'Kawamata N', 'Iwanski GB', 'Lasho T', 'Weiss T', 'Nowak D', 'Koren-Michowitz M', 'Kato M', 'Sanada M', 'Shih LY', 'Nagler A', 'Raynaud SD', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Mesa R', 'Haferlach T', 'Gilliland DG', 'Tefferi A', 'Ogawa S', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. nils.thoennissen@cshs.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prevalence', 'Survival Rate']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56533-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-235119 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Apr 8;115(14):2882-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-235119.

BCR-ABL activity is associated with increased proteasome activity and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are cytotoxic against CML cell lines. We demonstrate that bortezomib is antiproliferative and induces apoptosis in chronic phase (CP) CD34+ CML cells at clinically achievable concentrations. We also show that bortezomib targets primitive CML cells, with effects on CD34+38(-), long-term culture-initiating (LTC-IC) and nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) repopulating cells. Bortezomib is not selective for CML cells and induces apoptosis in normal CD34+38(-) cells. The effects against CML cells are seen when bortezomib is used alone and in combination with dasatinib. Bortezomib causes proteasome but not BCR-ABL inhibition and is also effective in inhibiting proteasome activity and inducing apoptosis in cell lines expressing BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I. By targeting both TKI-insensitive stem and progenitor cells and TKI-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, we believe that bortezomib offers a potential therapeutic option in CML. Because of known toxicities, including myelosuppression, the likely initial clinical application of bortezomib in CML would be in resistant and advanced disease.","['Heaney, Nicholas B', 'Pellicano, Francesca', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Crawford, Lisa', 'Chu, Su', 'Kazmi, Syed M A', 'Allan, Elaine K', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Irvine, Alexandra E', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Heaney NB', 'Pellicano F', 'Zhang B', 'Crawford L', 'Chu S', 'Kazmi SM', 'Allan EK', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Irvine AE', 'Bhatia R', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Medical Faculty, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56634-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-164582 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 18;115(11):2241-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-164582.

We investigated the role of several genes implicated in leukemic transformation by mutational analysis of 63 patients with AML secondary to a preexisting MPN (sAML). Frequent mutations were identified in TET2 (26.3%), ASXL1 (19.3%), IDH1 (9.5%), and JAK2 (36.8%) mutations in sAML, and all possible mutational combinations of these genes were also observed. Analysis of 14 patients for which paired samples from MPN and sAML were available showed that TET2 mutations were frequently acquired at leukemic transformation [6 of 14 (43%)]. In contrast, ASXL1 mutations were almost always detected in both the MPN and AML clones from individual patients. One case was also observed where TET2 and ASXL1 mutations were found before the patient acquired a JAK2 mutation or developed clinical evidence of MPN. We conclude that mutations in TET2, ASXL1, and IDH1 are common in sAML derived from a preexisting MPN. Although TET2/ASXL1 mutations may precede acquisition of JAK2 mutations by the MPN clone, mutations in TET2, but not ASXL1, are commonly acquired at the time of leukemic transformation. Our findings argue that the mutational order of events in MPN and sAML varies in different patients, and that TET2 and ASXL1 mutations have distinct roles in MPN pathogenesis and leukemic transformation. Given the presence of sAML that have no preexisting JAK2/TET2/ASXL1/IDH1 mutations, our work indicates the existence of other mutations yet to be identified that are necessary for leukemic transformation.","['Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Patel, Jay', 'Harris, Kelly', 'Yao, Jinjuan', 'Hedvat, Cyrus', 'Heguy, Adriana', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Abdel-Wahab O', 'Manshouri T', 'Patel J', 'Harris K', 'Yao J', 'Hedvat C', 'Heguy A', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Kantarjian H', 'Levine RL', 'Verstovsek S']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Here, we describe high-throughput murine leukemia virus insertional mutagenesis screens in mice that are deficient for one or two CDK inhibitors.

Many of these loci are skewed toward a specific genetic context of predisposing germline and somatic mutations. We also found associations between these loci with gender, age of tumor onset, and lymphocyte lineage (B or T cell). Comparison of retroviral insertion sites with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia revealed a significant overlap between the datasets.

However, blocking B-cell receptor signaling with dasatinib, an inhibitor of SRC kinase, produced variable results in preclinical and clinical studies. We aim to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential dasatinib sensitivity and to uncover more effective therapeutic targets in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fresh CLL B cells were treated with dasatinib, and cell viability was followed. The CLL cases were then divided into good and poor responders. The cellular response was correlated with the activities of B-cell receptor signaling molecules, as well as with molecular and cytogenetic prognostic factors. RESULTS: Among 50 CLL cases, dasatinib treatment reduced cell viability by 2% to 90%, with an average reduction of 47% on day 4 of culture. The drug induced CLL cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by reactive oxygen species. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of SRC family kinases was inhibited by dasatinib in good, as well as poor, responders. As opposed to SRC family kinases, activities of two downstream molecules, SYK and phospholipase Cgamma2, correlate well with the apoptotic response of CLL cells to dasatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, SYK inhibition predicts cellular response to dasatinib. SYK, together with phospholipase Cgamma2, may serve as potential biomarkers to predict dasatinib therapeutic response in patients. From the pathogenic perspective, our study suggests the existence of alternative mechanisms or pathways that activate SYK, independent of SRC kinase activities. The study further implicates that SYK might serve as a more effective therapeutic target in CLL treatment.","['Song, Zibo', 'Lu, Pin', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Leonard, John P', 'Martin, Peter', 'Tyrell, Lauren', 'Lee, Francis Y', 'Knowles, Daniel M', 'Coleman, Morton', 'Wang, Y Lynn']","['Song Z', 'Lu P', 'Furman RR', 'Leonard JP', 'Martin P', 'Tyrell L', 'Lee FY', 'Knowles DM', 'Coleman M', 'Wang YL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-1519 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1519 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jan 15;16(2):587-99. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1519.

Twenty-five patients experienced grade <or=2 sensory neuropathy (32), and 8% experienced grade 3 neurosensory toxicity. The overall response rate was 45% (40% on an intention to treat) including 10 complete remissions. Of 18 patients with FL, 9 responded with 4 complete response. The median time to treatment response for FL was 12 weeks, whereas the median time to treatment response for other subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was only 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that bortezomib has significant single agent activity in patients with FL, and that longer durations of treatment may improve overall response.","[""O'Connor, Owen A"", 'Portlock, Carol', 'Moskowitz, Craig', 'Hamlin, Paul', 'Straus, David', 'Gerecitano, John', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Dumitrescu, Otilia', 'Sarasohn, Debra', 'Butos, John', 'Neylon, Ellen', 'Mac-Gregor Cortelli, Barbara', 'Blumel, Susan', 'Evens, Andrew M', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Wright, John', 'Cooper, Brenda', 'Winter, Jane', 'Vose, Julie']","[""O'Connor OA"", 'Portlock C', 'Moskowitz C', 'Hamlin P', 'Straus D', 'Gerecitano J', 'Gonen M', 'Dumitrescu O', 'Sarasohn D', 'Butos J', 'Neylon E', 'Mac-Gregor Cortelli B', 'Blumel S', 'Evens AM', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Wright J', 'Cooper B', 'Winter J', 'Vose J']","['NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York, USA. oo2130@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2647 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2647 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jan 15;16(2):719-26. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2647.

Moreover, a different prognosis was reported for CLL expressing specific IGHV genes in the context or not of stereotyped B-cell receptors. Here we investigated novel associations between usage of specific IGHV genes and clinical features in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Among 1,426 CLL-specific IG-rearrangements, stereotyped B-cell receptor clusters never utilized the IGHV3-23 gene. Given this notion, this study was aimed at characterizing the IGHV3-23 gene in CLL, and identifying the properties of IGHV3-23-expressing CLL. RESULTS: IGHV3-23 was the second most frequently used (134 of 1,426) and usually mutated (M; 109 of 134) IGHV gene in our CLL series. In the vast majority of M IGHV3-23 sequences, the configuration of the 13 amino acids involved in superantigen recognition was consistent with superantigen binding. Clinically, M IGHV3-23 CLL had shorter time-to-treatment than other M non-IGHV3-23 CLL, and multivariate analyses selected IGHV3-23 gene usage, Rai staging, and chromosomal abnormalities as independent prognosticators for M CLL. Compared with M non-IGHV3-23 CLL, the gene expression profile of M IGHV3-23 CLL was deprived in genes, including the growth/tumor suppressor genes PDCD4, TIA1, and RASSF5, whose downregulation is under control of miR-15a and miR-16-1. Accordingly, relatively higher levels of miR-15a and miR-16-1 were found in M IGHV3-23 compared with M non-IGHV3-23 CLL. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, expression of the IGHV3-23 gene characterizes a CLL subset with distinct clinical and biological features.","['Bomben, Riccardo', 'Dal-Bo, Michele', 'Benedetti, Dania', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Marconi, Daniela', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Luciano, Fabrizio', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Cattarossi, Ilaria', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Nicoloso, Milena S', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Bomben R', 'Dal-Bo M', 'Benedetti D', 'Capello D', 'Forconi F', 'Marconi D', 'Bertoni F', 'Maffei R', 'Laurenti L', 'Rossi D', 'Del Principe MI', 'Luciano F', 'Sozzi E', 'Cattarossi I', 'Zucchetto A', 'Rossi FM', 'Bulian P', 'Zucca E', 'Nicoloso MS', 'Degan M', 'Marasca R', 'Efremov DG', 'Del Poeta G', 'Gaidano G', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement/physiology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-1638 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1638 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jan 15;16(2):620-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1638.

Based on this association, it is not unreasonable to assume that children could also get AML if they were exposed to comparable levels of benzene. Fortunately, reports of such exposures and subsequent AML development in children are non-existent. However, the question of whether children can develop leukemia at far lower, environmental levels of benzene remains. The existing scientific evidence relevant to this question will be addressed in this review. While positive findings have been reported, the collective literature does not indicate that exposure to environmental levels of benzene is related to an increased risk of childhood leukemia.

As outcome may be influenced by type and composition of treatment, we analyzed 19 BCP-ALL patients with dic(9;20) who have been treated with ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) protocols that included a 4-drug induction and subsequent consolidation therapy. All patients were good responders to prednisone and in complete remission after induction therapy. Eight patients had no molecular disease after induction and another eight patients had levels < or =10(-4) after consolidation therapy. After a median follow-up of 3.4 years, probabilities of 5-year event-free and overall survival were 75 +/- 11% and 94 +/- 6%, respectively. Of note, there was a tendency for extramedullary disease in case of relapse (two of three relapses with central nervous system involvement). In conclusion, in the context of ALL-BFM protocols dic(9;20)-positivity appeared to have a favourable prognosis, which could be due to a dose- and time-intensified induction and induction consolidation therapy. Given that in vitro studies have shown high cellular sensitivity of dic(9;20)-positive leukemic blasts to l-asparaginase and cytarabine, it is reasonable to speculate that both drugs, as given early during BFM-like induction and consolidation therapy, may have contributed to this good outcome.","['Pichler, Herbert', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Mann, Georg', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Nebral, Karin', 'Konig, Margit', 'Inthal, Andrea', 'Krehan, Daniela', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Janousek, Dasa', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe']","['Pichler H', 'Moricke A', 'Mann G', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Niggli F', 'Nebral K', 'Konig M', 'Inthal A', 'Krehan D', 'Dworzak MN', 'Janousek D', 'Harbott J', 'Schrappe M', 'Gadner H', 'Strehl S', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Attarbaschi A']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8059 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08059.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Apr;149(1):93-100. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08059.x.

Amplification across the translocation breakpoint was performed in samples from 91 patients with CML and 15 patients with APML using single-tube multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) involving 308 primers for CML and 40 primers for APML. Nonspecific amplification was removed by a modification of PCR, termed sequential hybrid primer PCR (SHP-PCR), which involved two sequential rounds of PCR, each of which used a low concentration of a specially designed hybrid primer. The resultant amplified material was sequenced. The method as finally developed was simple quick and robust. The translocation breakpoint was successfully isolated and sequenced in all 106 samples. The strategy of highly multiplexed PCR followed by SHP-PCR is thus an effective method for isolating the translocation breakpoint in CML and APML.

These strains belonged to 21 different genera, but most were members of Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Micromonospora. Some Actinobacteria have been reported to use the mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids as secondary metabolites. Therefore, we investigated whether these strains possessed the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (hmgr) gene, which indicates the presence of the mevalonate pathway. As a result, six strains belonging to the genera Streptomyces (SpC080624SC-11, SpA080624GE-02, and Sp080513GE-23), Nocardia (Sp080513SC-18), and Micromonospora (Se080624GE-07 and SpC080624GE-05) were found to possess the hmgr gene, and these genes were highly similar to hmgr genes in isoprenoid biosynthetic gene clusters.

Recently GSTM1 has been reported to be a significant risk factor for hematological relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, therefore we hypothesized that GSTM1 plays important roles in glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic pathways. To clarify the relationship between GSTM1 and drug resistance, GSTM1 was transfected into a T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, CCRF-CEM (CEM), and we established the GSTM1-expressing cell lines CEM/M1-4 and CEM/M1-9. Transduction of GSTM1 into CEM selectively decreased cellular sensitivity to dexamethasone in a manner that was independent of glutathione conjugation, but was due to apoptosis inhibition. Dexamethasone-induced p38-MAPK and Bim activation were concomitantly suppressed. Interestingly, nuclear factor kappa b (NF-kappaB) p50 activity was upregulated in GSTM1-expressing CEM. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by the pharmacological agent BAY11-7082 greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the GSTM1-expressing CEM to dexamethasone and was accompanied by an increase in Bim expression. Thus, we propose that GSTM1, a novel regulator of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, causes dexamethasone resistance by suppression of Bim through dual mechanisms of both downregulation of p38-MAPK and upregulation of NF-kappaB p50.","['Hosono, Naoko', 'Kishi, Shinji', 'Iho, Sumiko', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Kurooka, Hisanori', 'Yokota, Yoshifumi', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Hosono N', 'Kishi S', 'Iho S', 'Urasaki Y', 'Yoshida A', 'Kurooka H', 'Yokota Y', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Eiheiji, Fukui, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione Transferase/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1432 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01432.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Mar;101(3):767-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01432.x.

METHODS: MTT assay was performed to detect the inhibition of proliferation of Raji, Jurkat, and ALL primary cells. The cells were exposed to ART at various concentrations with or without VCR or Ara-C. The morphological changes of Raji and Jurkat cells were observed under light microscopy after Wright-Giemsa dyeing and electron transmission microscopy. The mitochondria transmenbrane potential was measured by Rhodamine 123 staining. Colorimetric method was used to measure the activities of caspase-3 in those tumor cells. RESULTS: ART inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells, Jurkat cells and ALL primary cells. The cytotoxicity of ART on Raji cells and Jurkat cells at a low concentration increased when combined with VCR or Ara-C. Apoptosis in Raji cells and Jurkat cells appeared after exposure to ART. Raji cells and Jurkat cells exposed to ART showed mitochondria transmembrane potential collapse. ART increased the caspase-3 activities of Raji, Jurkat and ALL primary cells.

The expression of cyclin D2 in B-CLL cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 27 untreated patients in relation to the apoptosis ratio both before and 72 h after culture in the absence of growth factors was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The significant associations between cell death in culture and both cyclin D2 expression in freshly isolated cells and the rate of its decrement in culture found in this study confirm the special role of cyclin D2 in enhancing the longevity of these cells in vivo. As cyclin D2 is inducible in the early G1 phase, its increased expression might also reflect the activation of cells attempting to replicate in vivo. Furthermore, the finding that B-CLL progression positively correlates with the gradual increase in the proportion of apoptotic B lymphocytes in culture seems to support the notion of cells striving to undergo division in the absence of growth factors.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate, whether this combined effect of As2O3 and DHA is also applicable to other PUFAs [i.e., eicospentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (AA), and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)]. Fourteen tumor cell lines were incubated with As2O3 (1 microM), PUFA (25-100 microM), or the combination thereof (+/- vitamin E). Cell viability (colorimetric), apoptosis (bivariate annexin V/propidium iodide staining, detection of hypodiploid DNA), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were evaluated. Twelve of 14 As2O3-resistant cell lines tested were resistant to PUFA monotherapy. However, combined treatment with As2O3 and either PUFA significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner with AA being the most potent As2O3 enhancer. The combined cytotoxic effect of As2O3/AA treatment was due to induction of apoptosis, preceded by increased intracellular TBARS and was abolished by the antioxidant vitamin E. Importantly, the combined effect of As2O3 and AA was selectively toxic for malignant cells because no cytotoxic effect was observed in normal skin fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, our study shows that also other PUFAs than DHA-and in particular the omega-6-PUFA AA--can be used as effective modulators of tumor cell chemosensitivity to clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3. Enhanced lipid peroxidation most likely constitutes the key mechanism for the combined effect.","['Wirtitsch, Melanie', 'Roth, Erich', 'Bachleitner-Hofmann, Thomas', 'Wessner, Barbara', 'Sturlan, Sanda']","['Wirtitsch M', 'Roth E', 'Bachleitner-Hofmann T', 'Wessner B', 'Sturlan S']","['Surgical Research Laboratories, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-6)', '0 (Oxides)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-6/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology']",2010/01/14 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2010/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504009789954654 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2009;18(2-3):83-94. doi: 10.3727/096504009789954654.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two human HCC cell lines, SMMC7721 and HepG2, were used in this study. Immunostaining, Western blotting and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were conducted to identify the expression of HPPCn and the existence of an autocrine loop of HPPCn/HPPCn receptor in SMMC7721 and HepG2. Apoptotic cells were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide. RESULTS: The HPPCn was highly expressed in human HCC cells and secreted into culture medium (CM). FITC-labeled recombinant human protein (rhHPPCn) could specifically bind to its receptor on HepaG2 cells. Treatment with 400 ng/mL rhHPPCn dramatically increased the viability of HCC-derived cells from 48.1% and 36.9% to 85.6% and 88.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). HPPCn silenced by small-interfering RNA reduced the expression and secretion of HPPCn and increased the apoptosis induced by trichostatin A. Additionally, HPPCn could up-regulate the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in HCC cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and sphingosine kinase-1. CONCLUSION: HPPCn is a novel hepatic growth factor that can be secreted to CM and suppresses apoptosis of HCC cells by up-regulating Mcl-1 expression.","['Chang, Jing', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhang, Dong-Dong', 'Zhang, Da-Jin', 'Wu, Chu-Tse', 'Wang, Li-Sheng', 'Cui, Chun-Ping']","['Chang J', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang DD', 'Zhang DJ', 'Wu CT', 'Wang LS', 'Cui CP']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, 27 Taiping Road, Beijing 100850, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v16.i2.193 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2010 Jan 14;16(2):193-200. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v16.i2.193.,,,,,,,PMC2806557,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structures of Mcl-1, and of other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, reveal a surface groove into which the alpha-helical BH3 regions of certain proapoptotic proteins can bind. Despite high overall structural conservation, differences in this groove afford binding specificity that is important for the mechanism of Bcl-2 family function. We report the crystal structure of human Mcl-1 bound to a BH3 peptide derived from human Bim and the structures for three complexes that accommodate large physicochemical changes at conserved Bim sites. The mutations had surprisingly modest effects on complex stability, and the structures show that Mcl-1 can undergo small changes to accommodate the mutant ligands. For example, a shift in a leucine side chain fills a hole left by an isoleucine-to-alanine mutation at the first hydrophobic buried position of Bim BH3. Larger changes are also observed, with shifting of helix alpha3 accommodating an isoleucine-to-tyrosine mutation at this same position. We surveyed the variation in available Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) structures and observed moderate flexibility that is likely critical for facilitating interactions of diverse BH3-only proteins with Mcl-1. With the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members attracting significant attention as therapeutic targets, these structures contribute to our growing understanding of how specificity is achieved and can help to guide the design of novel inhibitors that target Mcl-1.","['Fire, Emiko', 'Gulla, Stefano V', 'Grant, Robert A', 'Keating, Amy E']","['Fire E', 'Gulla SV', 'Grant RA', 'Keating AE']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*chemistry/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pro.329 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2010 Mar;19(3):507-19. doi: 10.1002/pro.329.,10.1002/pro.329 [doi],,,,,"['R01 GM084181/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-GM068762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM084181/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2866276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased membrane transport is a mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine. In order to facilitate gemcitabine uptake and prolong retention in the cell, a lipophilic pro-drug was synthesized (CP-4126), with an elaidic fatty acid esterified at the 5'position. CP-4126 was tested in cell lines resistant to cytarabine, another dCyd analog or gemcitabine. Activity of gemcitabine and the derivative was comparable in the parent cell lines, while in dCK deficient cells all compounds were inactive. However, inhibition of nucleoside transport increased the IC(50) for gemcitabine up to 200-fold, but not for CP-4126, underlining the independence of a nucleoside transporter. For in vivo evaluation, nude mice bearing a human xenograft were treated intraperitoneally every third day for five doses at the maximal tolerated dose. In melanoma, sarcoma, lung, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer xenografts, gemcitabine and CP-4126 were equally and highly effective; in four other xenografts moderately but equally active. In contrast to gemcitabine, CP-4126 could be administered orally, with a schedule and dose dependent toxicity and antitumor activity. In a colon cancer xenograft, antitumor activity of orally administered CP-4126 was equal to the intraperitoneally administered drug. In conclusion, CP-4126 is membrane transporter independent. Intraperitoneally administered CP-4126 was as effective as gemcitabine in several xenografts and CP-4126 is tolerated when orally administered.

This finding, if confirmed, would have a profound effect on the understanding and treatment of an incapacitating disease affecting millions worldwide. We have investigated CFS sufferers in the UK to determine if they are carriers of XMRV. METHODOLOGY: Patients in our CFS cohort had undergone medical screening to exclude detectable organic illness and met the CDC criteria for CFS. DNA extracted from blood samples of 186 CFS patients were screened for XMRV provirus and for the closely related murine leukaemia virus by nested PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers. To control for the integrity of the DNA, the cellular beta-globin gene was amplified. Negative controls (water) and a positive control (XMRV infectious molecular clone DNA) were included. While the beta-globin gene was amplified in all 186 samples, neither XMRV nor MLV sequences were detected. CONCLUSION: XMRV or MLV sequences were not amplified from DNA originating from CFS patients in the UK. Although we found no evidence that XMRV is associated with CFS in the UK, this may be a result of population differences between North America and Europe regarding the general prevalence of XMRV infection, and might also explain the fact that two US groups found XMRV in prostate cancer tissue, while two European studies did not.","['Erlwein, Otto', 'Kaye, Steve', 'McClure, Myra O', 'Weber, Jonathan', 'Wills, Gillian', 'Collier, David', 'Wessely, Simon', 'Cleare, Anthony']","['Erlwein O', 'Kaye S', 'McClure MO', 'Weber J', 'Wills G', 'Collier D', 'Wessely S', 'Cleare A']","[""Jefferiss Research Trust Laboratories, Section of Infectious Diseases, Wright-Fleming Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2009/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008519 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jan 6;5(1):e8519. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008519.,10.1371/journal.pone.0008519 [doi],20100106,,,,,PMC2795199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML cells express the myeloid marker CD33, making it amenable to CD33-targeted therapy. Thus, the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities of lintuzumab (SGN-33), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody undergoing clinical evaluation, were investigated. In vitro assays were used to assess the ability of lintuzumab to mediate effector functions and to decrease the production of growth factors from AML cells. SCID mice models of disseminated AML with the multi-drug resistance (MDR)-negative HL60 and the MDR(+), HEL9217 and TF1-alpha, cell lines were developed and applied to examine the in vivo antitumor activity. In vitro, lintuzumab significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by AML cells. Lintuzumab promoted tumor cell killing through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) activities against MDR(-) and MDR(+) AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples. At doses from 3 to 30 mg/kg, lintuzumab significantly enhanced survival and reduced tumor burden in vivo, regardless of MDR status. Survival of the mice was dependent upon the activity of resident macrophages and neutrophils. The results suggest that lintuzumab may exert its therapeutic effects by modulating the cytokine milieu in the tumor microenvironment and through effector mediated cell killing. Given that lintuzumab induced meaningful responses in a phase 1 clinical trial, the preclinical antitumor activities defined in this study may underlie its observed therapeutic efficacy in AML patients.","['Sutherland, May Kung', 'Yu, Changpu', 'Lewis, Timothy S', 'Miyamoto, Jamie B', 'Morris-Tilden, Carol A', 'Jonas, Mechthild', 'Sutherland, Jennifer', 'Nesterova, Albina', 'Gerber, Hans-Peter', 'Sievers, Eric L', 'Grewal, Iqbal S', 'Law, Che-Leung']","['Sutherland MK', 'Yu C', 'Lewis TS', 'Miyamoto JB', 'Morris-Tilden CA', 'Jonas M', 'Sutherland J', 'Nesterova A', 'Gerber HP', 'Sievers EL', 'Grewal IS', 'Law CL']","['Department of Pre-Clinical Therapeutics, Seattle Genetics, Inc., Bothell, WA, USA. msutherland@seagen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', '*Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phagocytosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Treatment Outcome', 'U937 Cells']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['9288 [pii]', '10.4161/mabs.1.5.9288 [doi]']",ppublish,MAbs. 2009 Sep-Oct;1(5):481-90. doi: 10.4161/mabs.1.5.9288.

Exposure of U937 and other leukemia cells to LBH-589 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) followed by single strand (XRCC1) and double strand (gamma-H2AX) DNA breaks. Notably, LBH-589 lethality was markedly attenuated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of the DNA damage-linked histone, H1.2. LBH-589 triggered p65/RelA activation, NF-kappaB-dependent induction of Mn-SOD2, and ROS elimination. Interference with LBH-589-mediated NF-kappaB activation (e.g. in I kappaB alpha super-repressor transfected cells) diminished HDACI-mediated Mn-SOD2 induction and increased ROS accumulation, DNA damage, and apoptosis. The Mn-SOD2 mimetic TBAP (manganese(III)-tetrakis 4-benzoic acid porphyrin) prevented HDACI-induced ROS and NF-kappaB activation while dramatically attenuating DNA damage and cell death. In contrast, TRAF2 siRNA knockdown, targeting receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation, blocked TNFalpha- but not HDACI-mediated NF-kappaB activation and lethality. Consistent with ROS-mediated DNA damage, LBH-589 exposure activated ATM (on serine 1981) and increased its association with NEMO. Significantly, siRNA NEMO or ATM knockdown blocked HDACI-mediated NF-kappaB activation, resulting in diminished MnSOD2 induction and enhanced oxidative DNA damage and cell death. In accord with the recently described DNA damage/ATM/NEMO pathway, SUMOylation site mutant NEMO (K277A or K309A) cells exposed to LBH-589 displayed diminished ATM/NEMO association, NEMO and p65/RelA nuclear localization/activation, and MnSOD2 up-regulation. These events were accompanied by increased ROS production, gamma-H2AX formation, and cell death. Together, these findings indicate that in human leukemia cells, HDACIs activate the cytoprotective NF-kappaB pathway through an ATM/NEMO/SUMOylation-dependent process involving the induction of ROS and DNA damage and suggest that blocking NF-kappaB activation via the atypical ATM/NEMO nuclear pathway can enhance HDACI antileukemic activity.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Kolla, Sarah S', 'Hock, Stefanie K', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Patel, Ankita', 'Amin, Sanjay', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Fisher, Paul B', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Kolla SS', 'Hock SK', 'Almenara JA', 'Patel A', 'Amin S', 'Atadja P', 'Fisher PB', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.', 'Human and Molecular Genetics, Richmond, Virginia 23298; Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Molecular Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Biochemistry, the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia 23298; Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Molecular Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298.', 'Departments of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298; Biochemistry, the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia 23298; Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Molecular Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298.

The chosen compounds provided the opportunity for probing the relationships between the structure ligand structure and the drug effects on transcription, information that might lead to a greater understanding of their potential as antitumour agents. As revealed by DNA microarray analysis of 6000 genes, at equitoxic doses, 5xIC(50) values for growth inhibition, all of the drugs perturb transcription, resulting in both up- and down-regulation of many hundreds of genes, 24 h after drug exposure. Under these conditions, the capacity to inhibit transcription decreases in the order C3NC3 morpholino > C2pipC2 morpholino > C8 piperidine > C8NMP > C2pipC2 piperidine. Cluster analysis segregated the examined agents into two groups: the first included C2pipC2 morpholino and C3NC3 morpholino and the second C2pipC2 piperidine, C8 piperidine and C8NMP. This classification agreed with the ontological analysis for the markedly up-regulated genes that showed a relatively specific profile for each group. Interestingly, the general up-regulation responses for the first group (C3NC3 morpholino and C2pipC2 morpholino) indicated marked up-regulation amongst the transcription gene set, which suggests that the transcription machinery is the main target for the members of this group. While in the second group (C2pipC2 piperidine, C8 piperidine, C8NMP), the general up-regulation responses for the three agents are dominated by the protein modification process ontological class, implying at least involvement of topoisomerase poisoning in their mode of action.","['Zihlif, Malek', 'Catchpoole, Daniel R', 'Stewart, Bernard W', 'Wakelin, Laurence P G']","['Zihlif M', 'Catchpoole DR', 'Stewart BW', 'Wakelin LP']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman 11942, Jordan.

BAALC MRNA expression was determined in 368 primary adult B-precursor ALL patients enrolled on the 06/99 and 07/03 GMALL trials. Patients were grouped into tertiles according to BAALC expression (T1-T3). Higher BAALC expression (T3 vs T2 vs T1) was associated with higher age (P < .001), a higher white blood cell count (P = .008), CD34 (P = .001), BCR-ABL (P < .001), and MLL-AF4 (P < .001).

Gene-expression profiling revealed an up-regulation of stem cell markers and genes involved in chemoresistance (TSPAN7 and LYN) in the high BAALC group.

Full genetic characterization is needed to identify events concurring in the development of these leukemias. DESIGN AND METHODS: We designed a combined interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization strategy to study 25 oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and applied it in 23 adult patients for whom immunophenotyping, karyotyping, molecular studies, and gene expression profiling data were available. The results were confirmed and integrated with those of multiplex-polymerase chain reaction analysis and gene expression profiling in another 129 adults with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. RESULTS: The combined hybridization was abnormal in 21/23 patients (91%), and revealed multiple genomic changes in 13 (56%). It found abnormalities known to be associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, i.e. CDKN2A-B/9p21 and GRIK2/6q16 deletions, TCR and TLX3 rearrangements, SIL-TAL1, CALM-AF10, MLL-translocations, del(17)(q12)/NF1 and other cryptic genomic imbalances, i.e. 9q34, 11p, 12p, and 17q11 duplication, del(5)(q35), del(7)(q34), del(9)(q34), del(12)(p13), and del(14)(q11). It revealed new cytogenetic mechanisms for TCRB-driven oncogene activation and C-MYB duplication. In two cases with cryptic del(9)(q34), fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction detected the TAF_INUP214 fusion and gene expression profiling identified a signature characterized by HOXA and NUP214 upregulation and TAF_I, FNBP1, C9orf78, and USP20 down-regulation. Multiplex-polymerase chain reaction analysis and gene expression profiling of 129 further cases found five additional cases of TAF_I-NUP214-positive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our combined interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization strategy greatly improved the detection of genetic abnormalities in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. It identified new tumor suppressor genes/oncogenes involved in leukemogenesis and highlighted concurrent involvement of genes. The estimated incidence of TAF_I-NUP214, a new recurrent fusion in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, was 4.6% (7/152).","['Gorello, Paolo', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Varasano, Emanuela', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Barba, Gianluca', 'Brandimarte, Lucia', 'Crescenzi, Barbara', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Messina, Monica', 'Grammatico, Sara', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Matteucci, Caterina', 'Bardi, Antonella', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Martelli, Massimo Fabrizio', 'Foa, Robin', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['Gorello P', 'La Starza R', 'Varasano E', 'Chiaretti S', 'Elia L', 'Pierini V', 'Barba G', 'Brandimarte L', 'Crescenzi B', 'Vitale A', 'Messina M', 'Grammatico S', 'Mancini M', 'Matteucci C', 'Bardi A', 'Guarini A', 'Martelli MF', 'Foa R', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/13 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['95/1/79 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.010413 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jan;95(1):79-86. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.010413.,10.3324/haematol.2009.010413 [doi],,,,,,PMC2805748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study with four mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, we report a new major metabolic pathway for 8-Cl-Ado intracellular metabolism, the formation of succinyl-8-chloro-adenosine (S-8-Cl-Ado) and its monophosphate (S-8-Cl-AMP). 8-Cl-AMP levels were highly associated with S-8-Cl-AMP levels and reached a steady-state prior to the secondary metabolites, 8-Cl-ATP and S-8-Cl-Ado. Consistent with fumarate as a required substrate for formation of succinyl-8-Cl-adenylate metabolites, the S-8-Cl-adenylate concentrations in multiple cell lines were associated with fumarate loss. The distribution of metabolites was also altered using the energy metabolism modifiers, metformin and oligomycin. The rates of succinyl-8-Cl-adenylate metabolism were enhanced by increasing the intracellular fumarate concentrations after metformin co-treatment. In addition, the S-8-Cl-AMP concentrations were increased after acute inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin. We conclude that 8-Cl-Ado metabolism not only affects intracellular purine metabolism; 8-Cl-Ado conversion to succinyl analogs ties its metabolism to the citric acid cycle by reduction of the fumarate pool.","['Dennison, Jennifer B', 'Ayres, Mary L', 'Kaluarachchi, Kumar', 'Plunkett, William', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Dennison JB', 'Ayres ML', 'Kaluarachchi K', 'Plunkett W', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fumarates)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'AB6MNQ6J6L (Succinic Acid)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', '8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Citric Acid Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Fumarates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Metformin/pharmacology', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Succinic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/04/16 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)64441-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.085803 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Mar 12;285(11):8022-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.085803.

Cells from these patients offer a unique system to help define at the molecular level the consequences of defective CUL4B specifically. We show that these patient-derived cells exhibit sensitivity to camptothecin (CPT), impaired CPT-induced topoisomerase I (Topo I) degradation and ubiquitination, thereby suggesting Topo I to be a novel Cul4-dependent substrate. Consistent with this, we also find that these cells exhibit increased levels of CPT-induced DNA breaks. Furthermore, over-expression of known CUL4-dependent substrates including Cdt1 and p21 appear to be a feature of these patient-derived cells.

In this paper, we propose robust nonparametric tools for the description and analysis of microarray data based on the concept of functional depth, which measures the centrality of an observation within a sample. We show that this concept can be easily adapted to high-dimensional observations and, in particular, to gene expression data. This allows the development of the following depth-based inference tools: (1) a scale curve for measuring and visualizing the dispersion of a set of points, (2) a rank test for deciding if 2 groups of multidimensional observations come from the same population, and (3) supervised classification techniques for assigning a new sample to one of G given groups. We apply these methods to microarray data, and to simulated data including contaminated models, and show that they are robust, efficient, and competitive with other procedures proposed in the literature, outperforming them in some situations.","['Lopez-Pintado, Sara', 'Romo, Juan', 'Torrente, Aurora']","['Lopez-Pintado S', 'Romo J', 'Torrente A']","['Departamento de Economia, Metodos Cuantitativos e Historia Economica, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain. sloppin@upo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biostatistics,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",100897327,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biometry/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/06/24 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['kxp056 [pii]', '10.1093/biostatistics/kxp056 [doi]']",ppublish,Biostatistics. 2010 Apr;11(2):254-64. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxp056.

Integrating evidence from all available studies that are of sufficient quality combined with flexible meta-regression models is likely to provide better insight into the functional relation between benzene exposure and risk of leukemia. OBJECTIVES: We used natural splines in a flexible meta-regression method to assess the shape of the benzene-leukemia ERC. METHODS: We fitted meta-regression models to 30 aggregated risk estimates extracted from nine human observational studies and performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of a priori assessed study characteristics on the predicted ERC. RESULTS: The natural spline showed a supralinear shape at cumulative exposures less than 100 ppm-years, although this model fitted the data only marginally better than a linear model (p = 0.06). Stratification based on study design and jackknifing indicated that the cohort studies had a considerable impact on the shape of the ERC at high exposure levels (> 100 ppm-years) but that predicted risks for the low exposure range (< 50 ppm-years) were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by the small number of studies and the large heterogeneity between studies, the inclusion of all studies of sufficient quality combined with a flexible meta-regression method provides the most comprehensive evaluation of the benzene-leukemia ERC to date. The natural spline based on all data indicates a significantly increased risk of leukemia [relative risk (RR) = 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.26] at an exposure level as low as 10 ppm-years.","['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Lan, Qing', 'Kromhout, Hans', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Portengen L', 'Rothman N', 'Lan Q', 'Kromhout H', 'Vermeulen R']","['Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.

It is unknown whether normal or malignant human B-lineage cells express HO-1. 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) is an interesting electrophilic lipid mediator able to increase oxidative stress in B cells. Here, we tested normal and malignant human B-lineage cells for their ability to express HO-1 in response to 15d-PGJ(2), as well as the signaling pathways required for HO-1 expression. 15d-PGJ(2) potently induced HO-1 protein expression in normal and malignant B cells. Malignant B cells exhibited a greater induction of HO-1 protein compared to normal B lymphocytes. Using siRNA directed against the transcription factor Nrf2 and B cells isolated from Nrf2-deficient mice, we show that HO-1 induction by 15d-PGJ(2) is dependent on Nrf2. These results show that, compared to normal B lymphocytes, malignant B cells have a greater capacity to increase their HO-1 protein levels in response to 15d-PGJ(2). We speculate that the ability to highly express HO-1 by malignant B cells could confer a survival advantage.","['Bancos, Simona', 'Baglole, Carolyn J', 'Rahman, Irfan', 'Phipps, Richard P']","['Bancos S', 'Baglole CJ', 'Rahman I', 'Phipps RP']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/immunology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0008-8749(09)00223-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellimm.2009.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2010;262(1):18-27. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2009.12.003.

AIM OF STUDY: To document plants commonly used to treat cancer in South-western Nigeria and to test the scientific basis of the claims using in vitro cytotoxicity tests. METHODS: Structured questionnaires were used to explore the ethnobotanical practices amongst the traditional healers. Methanol extracts of the most common species cited were screened for cytotoxicity using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in both exposure and recovery experiments. Three cancer cell lines (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7, human large cell lung carcinoma cell line COR-L23 and human amelanotic melanoma C32) and one normal cell line (normal human keratinocytes SVK-14) were used for the screening of the extracts and the fractions obtained. The extract of Cajanus cajan showed considerable activity and was further partitioned and the dichloromethane fraction was subjected to preparative chomatography to yield six compounds: hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, alpha-amyrin, beta-sitosterol, pinostrobin, longistylin A and longistylin C. Pinostrobin and longistylins A and C were tested for cytotoxicity on the cancer cell lines. In addition, an adriamycin-sensitive acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line (CCRF-CEM) and its multidrug-resistant sub-line (CEM/ADR5000) were used in an XTT assay to evaluate the activity of the pure compounds obtained. RESULTS: A total of 30 healers from S W Nigeria were involved in the study. 45 species were recorded with their local names with parts used in the traditional therapeutic preparations. Cytotoxicity (IC(50) values less than 50 microg/mL) was observed in 5 species (Acanthospermum hispidum, Cajanus cajan, Morinda lucida, Nymphaea lotus and Pycnanthus angolensis). Acanthospermum hispidum and Cajanus cajan were the most active. The dichloromethane fraction of Cajanus cajan had IC(50) value 5-10 microg/mL, with the two constituent stilbenes, longistylins A and C, being primarily responsible, with IC(50) values of 0.7-14.7 microM against the range of cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the species tested had some cytotoxic effect on the cancer cell lines, which to some extent supports their traditional inclusion in herbal preparations for treatment of cancer. However, little selectivity for cancer cells was observed, which raises concerns over their safety and efficacy in traditional treatment. The longistylins A and C appear to be responsible for much of the activity of Cajanus cajan extract.","['Ashidi, J S', 'Houghton, P J', 'Hylands, P J', 'Efferth, T']","['Ashidi JS', 'Houghton PJ', 'Hylands PJ', 'Efferth T']","[""Pharmaceutical Science Division, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, 150 Stamford Street, London SE1 9NH, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Sitosterols)', '5LI01C78DD (gamma-sitosterol)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'KM8353IPSO (beta-amyrin)', 'SZD9LZS694 (pinostrobin)']",IM,"['Cajanus/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Data Collection', '*Ethnobotany', 'Ethnopharmacology', 'Flavanones/isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Nigeria', 'Oleanolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Plants/*chemistry', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Sitosterols/isolation & purification/toxicity']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(10)00026-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2010 Mar 24;128(2):501-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.009.

Here we show that NB4 cells express high levels of the recently identified membrane receptor for 1,25D(3), which is a distinct gene product from the classical nuclear vitamin D receptor. This 57 kDa protein, named 1,25D(3)-MARRS (Membrane Activated Rapid Response to Steroids)/ERp57/PIA3 appears to associate in a complex with the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). In unstimulated cells, 1,25D(3)-MARRS can be co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed at NFkappaB, and NFkappaB is co-precipitated when antibodies against 1,25D(3)-MARRS or ERp57 are used. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that both 1,25D(3)-MARRS and NFkappaB begin translocating to the nucleus within minutes of co-stimulation with 1,25D(3) and phorbol ester. The predominant nuclear localization of both proteins precedes the expression of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype and suggests that this event may be critical to the differentiation pathway. This suggests a role for 1,25D(3)-MARRS in the nucleus as a regulator of gene expression. Here it may also regulate the activity of NFkappaB and other factors with which it may be interacting.","['Wu, Wenqing', 'Beilhartz, Greg', 'Roy, Yvette', 'Richard, Cynthia L', 'Curtin, Maureen', 'Brown, Lauren', 'Cadieux, Danielle', 'Coppolino, Marc', 'Farach-Carson, Mary C', 'Nemere, Ilka', 'Meckling, Kelly A']","['Wu W', 'Beilhartz G', 'Roy Y', 'Richard CL', 'Curtin M', 'Brown L', 'Cadieux D', 'Coppolino M', 'Farach-Carson MC', 'Nemere I', 'Meckling KA']","['Department of Human Health, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)', 'EC 5.3.4.1.

To identify mechanisms by which MLL perpetuates active transcription in dividing cells, we investigated its role during M phase of the cell cycle. Unlike other chromatin-modifying enzymes examined, we found that MLL associates with gene promoters packaged within condensed mitotic chromosomes. Genome-wide location analysis identified a globally rearranged pattern of MLL occupancy during mitosis in a manner favoring genes that were highly transcribed during interphase. Knockdown experiments revealed that MLL retention at gene promoters during mitosis accelerates transcription reactivation following mitotic exit. MLL tethers Menin, RbBP5, and ASH2L to its occupied sites during mitosis, but is dispensable for preserving histone H3K4 methylation. These findings implicate mitotic bookmarking as a component of Trithorax-based gene regulation, which may facilitate inheritance of active gene expression states during cell division.","['Blobel, Gerd A', 'Kadauke, Stephan', 'Wang, Eric', 'Lau, Alan W', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Chou, Margaret M', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Blobel GA', 'Kadauke S', 'Wang E', 'Lau AW', 'Zuber J', 'Chou MM', 'Vakoc CR']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (ASH2L protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RBBP5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interphase/genetics', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/02/06 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2009/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(09)00904-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2009 Dec 25;36(6):970-83. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.001.,10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.001 [doi],,,,,"['R01 DK058044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK58044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058044-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007150/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA01520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK058044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054937/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK54937/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054937-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2818742,['2009 Elsevier Inc.'],,['NIHMS165088'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The scFvs were isolated from a phage display library generated with spleen RNA from mice, immunized with a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of CD123 and the Fc domain of a human immunoglobulin G1. The scFvs displayed CD123-specific binding on tumour cells (binding constants (K(D)) 4.5-101 nmol/l). The scFv with the highest affinity was used to design two cell death-inducing molecules. First, an immunotoxin, a fusion protein with truncated Pseudomonas Exotoxin A, induced potent apoptosis of AML-derived MOLM-13 and SKNO-1 cells at nanomolar concentrations. Second, the fusion to another scFv, specific for the low affinity Fcgamma-receptor III (CD16), created a bispecific single chain Fv (bsscFv). This bsscFv [123 x ds16] mediated potent lysis of AML-derived MOLM-13, THP-1 and SKNO-1 cells in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) reactions at picomolar concentrations. The recruitment of CD16-positive effector cells for the lysis of AML cells via CD123 represents a novel combination with attractive prospects for future clinical testing.","['Stein, Christoph', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Kugler, Markus', 'Reiff, Nina', 'Mentz, Kristin', 'Schwenkert, Michael', 'Stockmeyer, Bernhard', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Fey, Georg H']","['Stein C', 'Kellner C', 'Kugler M', 'Reiff N', 'Mentz K', 'Schwenkert M', 'Stockmeyer B', 'Mackensen A', 'Fey GH']","['Chair of Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erwin-Rommel-Strasse 3, Erlangen, Germany. cstein@biologie.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bacterial Toxins/immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Exotoxins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*immunology', 'Immunotoxins/immunology', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors/immunology']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8033 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08033.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(6):879-89. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08033.x.

However, 40-50% of patients relapse, emphasizing the need for risk-adapted treatment approaches. In this regard, studying secondary genetic aberrations, such as mutations of the KIT gene, is of great interest, particularly as they can be targeted by receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, so far little is known about the biology underlying KIT-mutated CBF leukaemias. We analysed gene expression profiles of 83 CBF AML cases with known KIT mutation status in order to gain novel insights in KIT-mutated CBF pathogenesis. KIT-mutated cases were characterized by deregulation of genes belonging to the NFkB signalling complex suggesting impaired control of apoptosis. Notably, a subgroup of KIT wildtype cases was also characterized by the KIT mutation signature due to yet unknown aberrations. Our data suggest that this CBF leukaemia subgroup might profit from TKI therapy, however, the relevance of the KIT mutation-associated signature remains to be validated prior to clinical implementation. Nevertheless, the existence of such a signature supports the notion of relevant biological differences in CBF leukaemia and might serve as diagnostic tool in the future.","['Luck, Sonja C', 'Russ, Annika C', 'Du, Juan', 'Gaidzik, Verena', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Pollack, Jonathan R', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Bullinger, Lars']","['Luck SC', 'Russ AC', 'Du J', 'Gaidzik V', 'Schlenk RF', 'Pollack JR', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Bullinger L']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Core Binding Factors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8035 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08035.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(6):925-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08035.x.

Using these molecular markers of TL, we investigated the growth and differentiation potential of TL blasts in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs). Interleukin-3, stem cell factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor potently stimulated the growth of TL blast progenitors and induced differentiation towards basophil/mast cell lineages, whereas thrombopoietin induced differentiation towards megakaryocytes. GATA1s was expressed in TL blasts in all five patients examined but was down-regulated during differentiation induced by these HGFs, while full-length GATA1 was not expressed throughout the culture. GATA1 mutations were detected in TL blasts in four patients, including one patient with two distinct mutations. The cells of this patient exhibited identical and only mutated sequences both before and after culture with HGFs, confirming the leukemic cell origin of these differentiated cells. Erythroid differentiation of TL blasts was not evident with any HGFs. These data indicate that TL blasts have the potential to grow and differentiate towards particular hematopoietic lineages in the presence of specific HGFs and that the down-regulation of GATA1s might be involved in blast cell differentiation.","['Miyauchi, Jun', 'Ito, Yushi', 'Tsukamoto, Keiko', 'Takahashi, Hirotaka', 'Ishikura, Kenji', 'Sugita, Kiyoko', 'Miyashita, Toshiyuki']","['Miyauchi J', 'Ito Y', 'Tsukamoto K', 'Takahashi H', 'Ishikura K', 'Sugita K', 'Miyashita T']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital, 5-11-13 Sugano, Ichikawa, Chiba-ken, Japan. jmiyauchi@tdc.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Basophils/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Down Syndrome/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*ultrastructure']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8038 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08038.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(6):898-909. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08038.x.

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequence analysis identified a fusion between RUNX1 and the gene encoding ubiquitin specific peptidase-42 (USP42), with splice-variants and variable break-points within RUNX1. Combined cytomorphology and FISH studies in MDS marrow revealed abnormal RUNX1 signals within megakaryocytes, suggesting that the acquisition of t(7;21)(p22;q22) does not confer complete differentiation arrest and may represent an early genetic event in leukaemogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays failed to detect additional sub-microscopic genomic changes predisposing to or associated with t(7;21). Molecular analysis of 100 MDS and AML marrow specimens by RT-PCR did not reveal new cases with the RUNX1-USP42 fusion. Thus, our studies have identified t(7;21)(p22;q22) as a rare but recurrent abnormality in MDS/AML, with the existence of alternative spliced forms of the RUNX1-USP42 transcript in different patients.

METHODS: Ocular fundi were evaluated in 79 patients. Digital analyses regarding optic disc area (DA), rim area (RA) and cup area (CA) were performed in 45 of 49 patients. RB visual field testing was performed in 53 of 79 patients. The mean hit rate (MHR) was compared to corneal status, cataract, diagnosis and pre and post-SCT treatment. Two groups of healthy children and young adults (RB = 51, disc analysis = 49) were used as controls. RESULTS: The SCT patients, examined at a median age of 15.4 years, had a significantly lower MHR [median 91% (range 45-99) right eye and 91% (range 41-91) left eye] compared to controls [median 96% (range 78-100) right eye]. SCT patients treated surgically for cataract and with intraocular lenses (IOLs) had a significantly lower MHR compared to other SCT patients. The MHR was also significantly influenced by type of conditioning. Patients conditioned with chemotherapy other than busulfan had significantly better MHR compared to those who had received single-dose TBI. SCT patients had a significantly larger CA and smaller RA than the controls. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with SCT in childhood have a significantly lower MHR than controls when examined with RB.

High reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels favor oxidative stress, which could play a vital role in normal processes and various pathophysiologies including neoplasm. Biomarkers of oxidative stress are measured as products of oxidized proteins and lipids. Plasma levels of protein carbonyl (PC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) were used as biomarkers of oxidative stress in the past. The aim of this study was to evaluate the products of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in plasma as biomarkers of oxidative stress in CML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 40 CML patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Of 40 CML patients, 28 were in chronic phase (CML-CP) and 12 in accelerated phase (CML-AP). Plasma levels of PC, TBARS and LOOH as biomarkers of oxidative stress were evaluated by spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: There were significant differences (P < .05) in plasma levels of PC, TBARS and LOOH in CML, CML-CP and CML-AP patients as compared to controls. CONCLUSION: PC, TBARS and LOOH might reflect oxidative stress in CML patients and might be used as biomarkers in such patients.","['Singh, Raj K', 'Tripathi, Anil K', 'Tripathi, Payal', 'Singh, Sushma', 'Singh, Ranjana', 'Ahmad, Rizwan']","['Singh RK', 'Tripathi AK', 'Tripathi P', 'Singh S', 'Singh R', 'Ahmad R']","['Departments of Biochemistry, Chhatrapati Shahvji Maharaj Medical University, Lucknow, Utter Pradesh, India. singhrk23a@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxides/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Protein Carbonylation/physiology', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/analysis', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(09)50039-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50039-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2009;2(1):285-8. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50039-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we compared outcomes after allogeneic bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in patients who underwent transplant at Hospital das Clinicas of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 364 patients who received allogeneic BM (n = 142) or PBSC transplantation (n = 222) between July 1995 and May 2005. The median age of the patients was 31 years (range, 3.1-58 years). Chronic myeloid leukemia was the predominant diagnosis (41.2%). A conditioning regimen with cyclosphosphamide and busulfan was used in 79.4% (n = 289) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine/methotrexate in 95.9% (n = 349) of cases. RESULTS: The patients in the PBSC group had faster neutrophil (P < .001) and platelet engraftment (P = .03) but increased rates of acute GVHD (P < .001) vs. those in the BM group. There was no significant difference between the groups in chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality, relapse and survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Although allogeneic PBSC transplant results in a faster hematopoietic engraftment, there was an increase in acute GVHD. There was no clear benefit in relapse rate and no evidence that transplantation with PBSC benefits patient survival in our institution.","['Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Lopes, Monalisa', 'de Macedo, Antonio Vaz', 'Teixeira, Elen Rose', 'Gomes, Gabriel Gomes Sabido', 'Ferreira, Galileu Galilei', 'Amaral, Leandro', 'Soares, Priscila', 'Vieira, Monica', 'Dusse, Luci Maria']","['Bittencourt H', 'Lopes M', 'de Macedo AV', 'Teixeira ER', 'Gomes GG', 'Ferreira GG', 'Amaral L', 'Soares P', 'Vieira M', 'Dusse LM']","['Internal Medicine Department, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit/Hematology Division, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Brazil. hebit@terra.com.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/13 06:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(09)50037-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50037-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2009;2(1):272-7. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(09)50037-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the epidemiological patterns of malignancies in Bahrain and compared them with those of other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and other developed countries. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data for the study were obtained from the Bahrain Cancer Registry (BCR) database. The overall and type-specific 5-year average incidence rates were calculated for the years 1998-2002 and derived using the CANREG software formula. The incidence rates for the year 2000 were used for comparing Bahrain with those of other countries in the Arabian Gulf using the statistics of the Gulf Centre for Cancer Registration. RESULTS: During the 5-year period there were 2405 cancer cases in Bahrain (1239 males and 1166 females), with an annual average of 481 cases. The world age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were 162.3 and 145.2 per 100000 for Bahraini males and females, respectively. Generally, Bahraini men had a higher ASR for most cancer types, and the most common type of cancer was lung for males (35.2 per 100000), followed by bladder (14.5) and prostate (14.3), and breast for females (46.8), followed by lung (12.2) and ovary (7.7). CONCLUSION: Compared to other Gulf countries, Bahrain had higher incidence rates for cancers of the lung, prostate, colorectum, bladder, kidney, pancreas and leukemia among males and for cancers of the breast, lung, bladder, thyroid, uterus and ovary among females. A rising trend in cancer incidence is likely to continue for years or even decades to come.","['Alsayyad, Jamal', 'Hamadehb, Randah']","['Alsayyad J', 'Hamadehb R']","['Medical Review Office, Ministry of Health, Manama, Bahrain.

The frequency and types of additional chromosomal abnormalities in CML patients has not been determined in our region. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, prospective study of additional chromosomal abnormalities in patients with an established diagnosis of Philadelphia-positive CML from May 2001 to June 2007. Cytogenetic studies were repeated every three months with the conventional G-banding technique and described according to the international system for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. All patients received imatinib mesylate. RESULTS: In 219 patients with Philadelphia-positive CML, 34 (15.5%) (median age, 38 years) developed 51 additional chromosomal abnormalities. Five cases had variant translocations prior to starting imatinib; the remaining 29 cases acquired chromosomal abnormalities after starting imatinib, including 8 cases that received prior interferon-alfa. Twenty-one patients were in chronic phase, 10 in accelerated phase and 3 were in blast crisis. Trisomy 8 was the most frequent abnormality followed by random chromosomal abnormalities and variants of the Philadelphia chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: The overall frequency of additional chromosomal abnormalities was similar to that in previous reports. Early identification of these abnormalities may help in adapting to a more appropriate therapeutic approach.","['Syed, Naveen Naz', 'Usman, Mohammad', 'Adil, Salman', 'Khurshid, Mohammad']","['Syed NN', 'Usman M', 'Adil S', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Sindr, Pakistan. naveen.abari@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2008/07/01 00:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(08)50025-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50025-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2008 Jul-Sep;1(3):166-70. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50025-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetics-based stratification improves survival. Patients with AML and normal cytogenetics, the largest single subgroup, have had a very heterogeneous outcome with standard chemotherapy in multiple clinical trials. Hence it is difficult to recommend a ""one size fits all"" kind of treatment for this heterogeneous population of AML patients. New emerging data from preclinical, retrospective, and large, randomized controlled studies indicate that in addition to cytogenetic abnormalities, many other molecular aberrations are operative in the response to treatment as well as in the risk of relapse. Such molecular markers are being tested for developing targeted therapies and may help in improved stratification of patients in the selection of post-remission therapy. Emerging evidence reveals that at the submicroscopic level, AML with normal cytogenetics may carry poor prognostic genetic lesions or ""molecular signatures"" as is the case with FLT3 mutations and overexpression of BAALC, ERG or MN1, or may have aberrations that predict better risk as is the case with isolated NPM1 or CEBPA mutations. Later studies have tried to explore the interaction of various prognostically important genes in this group of AML patients. The utility of the evolving data for bedside management of such patients is expected to improve with the wider application of modern tools, using the proposed clinical outcome models, and probably by development of a risk-scoring system based on the relative risk associated with each molecular aberration. The goals include identifying those patients most likely to benefit from upfront allogeneic HSCT and sparing good-prognosis patients from unnecessary transplant-related morbidity. The following is an outline of the most common molecular changes, their impact on the outcome of AML patients with normal cytogenetics and challenges in their wide scale application in risk stratification.","['Zaidi, Syed Z', 'Owaidah, Tarek', 'Al Sharif, Fahad', 'Ahmed, Said Y', 'Chaudhri, Naeem', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud']","['Zaidi SZ', 'Owaidah T', 'Al Sharif F', 'Ahmed SY', 'Chaudhri N', 'Aljurf M']","['Adult Hematology & SCT Department, Prince Sultan Hematology Oncology Center, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Factors']",2008/07/01 00:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(08)50023-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50023-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2008 Jul-Sep;1(3):141-58. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50023-9.,,,143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also contrasted program activity and outcome to that reported from a state hospital in the same geographical area over a comparable period. METHODS: Conditioning employed either a sequential combination of fractionated 12Gy whole body and 6Gy total nodal irradiation separated by 120mg/kg of cyclophosphamide in patients over 15 years of age. Alternatively, the latter agent was combined initially with oral busulphan and later the intravenous equivalent. Neuroblastoma cases were prepared using a different regimen. In allografts the harvested product underwent ex vivo T-cell depletion with the humanized version of anti-CD 52 monoclonal antibody designated Campath 1H. No additional immunosuppression was given except where matched unrelated volunteer donors were employed. RESULTS: Sixty-eight procedures were carried out in 61 patients over a 6-year period. Of 11 with acute myeloid leukemia, 8 are alive and well whereas 8 of the 14 with the lymphoblastic variant have died. Of the remaining 12 with hematologic malignancy, all but 2 are alive. Ten of the 17 with aplasia are alive as are all with thalassemia or sickle cell disease. None of the four variables tested affected survival. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that the standardized preparative regimen, coupled with a now well-established immunosuppressive regimen, is as effective in patients under 18 years of age as in adults. Our analysis also indicates that in a resource-scarce or developing country, it is mandatory to limit high-risk and relatively expensive procedures to active teams that enjoy international accreditation, whether these be in the state or private sector.","['Wood, Lucille', 'Juritz, June', 'Havemann, Jonathan', 'Lund, Jo', 'Waldmann, Herman', 'Hale, Geoffrey', 'Jacobs, Peter']","['Wood L', 'Juritz J', 'Havemann J', 'Lund J', 'Waldmann H', 'Hale G', 'Jacobs P']","['Department of Haematology, Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic, Plumstead, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*standards', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'South Africa', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/standards']",2008/04/01 00:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(08)50038-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50038-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2008 Apr-Jun;1(2):80-9. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50038-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD66c is a myeloid marker which has aberrant expression in pre-B cell ALL, with strong correlation with non-random genetic changes (BCR/ABL rearrangement). Another leukemia associated marker (CD25) is frequently expressed in pre-B cell ALL. The frequency of CD25-expressing lymphoblasts has been found to be significantly higher in BCR/ABL-positive vs. BCR/ABL-negative patients. METHODS: In a cohort of 103 patients diagnosed with pre-B cell ALL or biphenotypic leukemia and studied for expression of CD66c and CD25 at presentation, we evaluated the frequency of expression of either or both in BCR/ABL positive cases. RESULTS: Surface CD66c was expressed by 70 cases (68%) and CD25 was expressed by 33 cases (32%) while both were expressed together on 29 cases (28%). BCR/ABL was positive in 18/103 patients. All BCR/ABL positive cases were positive for surface CD66c and CD25. CONCLUSION: Positivity for both leukemia-associated antigens CD66c and CD25 in combination can predict the presence of BCR/ABL rearrangement in pre-B cell ALL. While this finding does not replace the detection of BCR/ABL abnormality by cytogenetic or molecular techniques, it does provide an early and handy tool for prediction and management of high-risk cases of pre-B cell ALL, especially in centers with limited laboratory facilities.","['Owaidah, Tarek M', 'Rawas, Faisal I', 'Al Khayatt, Mazen F', 'Elkum, Nasser B']","['Owaidah TM', 'Rawas FI', 'Al Khayatt MF', 'Elkum NB']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. towaidah@kfshrc.edu.sa']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2008/01/01 00:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(08)50058-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50058-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2008 Jan-Mar;1(1):34-7. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50058-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of parents reported that the video made it easier to understand information that their child's physician later provided; 83% of parents reported that it helped them to think of questions to ask the physician; and 67% of parents indicated that the video made them feel more comfortable with asking questions of the physician. Results of a t-test comparing question asking during ICCs revealed that parents who participated in the intervention asked a higher rate of questions than parents from a historical control sample (t = 1.95, P = 0.05). DISCUSSION: Our study supports the feasibility and potential efficacy of a brief video intervention employing anticipatory guidance to prepare parents for future discussions about RCTs.","['Hazen, Rebecca A', 'Eder, Michelle', 'Drotar, Dennis', 'Zyzanski, Steve', 'Reynolds, Amy E', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kodish, Eric', 'Noll, Robert B']","['Hazen RA', 'Eder M', 'Drotar D', 'Zyzanski S', 'Reynolds AE', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kodish E', 'Noll RB']","[""Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Communication', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Parents/*education/*psychology', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Physician-Patient Relations', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/psychology/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods', '*Video Recording']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22411 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):113-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22411.,10.1002/pbc.22411 [doi],,,,,"['R01 CA083267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083267-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2874099,,,['NIHMS163749'],,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):10-1.

METHODS: Sixty-five newly diagnosed children and adolescents aged 0.4-21 years with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma were retrospectively evaluated for lipid abnormalities. They were treated according to the ALLIC-BFM 2002 protocol between 2002 and 2005. Fasting cholesterol levels were measured in all patients and triglycerides (TG) in 42/65 patients. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, mean cholesterol level was 149 +/- 50 mg/dl, and increased to maximal level 274 +/- 124 mg/dl during treatment. Mean TG level during treatment was 459 +/- 526 mg/dl (range 54-3,009). Twelve patients (28%) had TG levels <200 mg/dl, 18 (43%) had 200-400 mg/dl, 3 (7%) had 400-600 mg/dl, 4 (10%) between 600 and 1,000 mg/dl, and 5 (12%) patients had >1,000 mg/dl. No association was found between TG levels and age or gender. One of the 12 patients with TG >400 mg/dl developed left saggital sinus thrombosis and left frontal lobe infarct. TG level at the time of the event was 2,640 mg/dl. None of the five patients with TG levels >1,000 mg/dl developed pancreatitis. Children with TG levels between 400 and 600 mg/dl were treated by fasting. Fibrates and heparin were added to those with levels >600 mg/dl. Lipid abnormalities normalized in all children upon completion of asparaginase treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of lipid profile in children with ALL during asparaginase therapy are relatively common. We recommend measuring TG before and during asparaginase treatment. Initiation of conservative treatment could prevent further increase of TG and decrease the risk of potential complications.","['Cohen, Hofit', 'Bielorai, Bella', 'Harats, Dror', 'Toren, Amos', 'Pinhas-Hamiel, Orit']","['Cohen H', 'Bielorai B', 'Harats D', 'Toren A', 'Pinhas-Hamiel O']","['The Bert W.

The etiology is postulated to be secondary to aberrations in cell-mediated immunity, as well as to therapy-related immunosuppression. Hypogammaglobulinemia, which occurs in virtually all patients with CLL, may be profound and correlates with disease duration and stage. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy has been used successfully to prevent and treat infections in this cohort of patients. However IVIG administration and treatment is not benign and should be used with caution given the potential manifestations of thromboembolic complications. High concentration and rapid infusion rate of the IVIG, as well as increased dose and osmolarity of the solution are thought to predispose to thrombotic events. Serum viscosity is the implicated mechanism for compromised blood flow and predisposition of high-risk patients to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular infarction. We report a case of IVIG related thromboembolic manifestations in a CLL patient, to highlight the importance of risk stratifying patients prior to treatment administration. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 55-year-old Caucasian man with CLL who presented to our clinic with neutropenic fevers following a cycle of chemotherapy. Laboratory parameters revealed hypogammaglobulinemia prompting IVIG administration. Shortly thereafter, he developed a massive cascade of thromboembolic phenomena precipitating his demise. CONCLUSION: The current consensus surrounding IVIG is that of a relatively safe treatment, with minor adverse effects such as hypertension, fever and chills, nausea, myalgias, or headache. However our report highlights the importance of proceeding with caution in the application of this therapy, as it's proclivity for thrombotic complications has not been fully elucidated in patients with underlying malignancies. Pre-existing thrombogenic risk factors should be carefully evaluated in patients undergoing treatment with IVIG. Clinical evaluation, with careful attention to vascular history and underlying co-morbidities can potentially unmask the high-risk patient where IVIG could be lethal.","['Milani, Cannon', 'Dalia, Samir M', 'Colvin, Gerald A']","['Milani C', 'Dalia SM', 'Colvin GA']","['Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University and Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cases J,Cases journal,101474272,,,,2010/01/12 06:00,2010/01/12 06:01,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1186/1757-1626-2-9078 [doi]'],epublish,Cases J. 2009 Nov 23;2:9078. doi: 10.1186/1757-1626-2-9078.,10.1186/1757-1626-2-9078 [doi],20091123,,,,,PMC2803875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 75 Chinese patients were transplanted with T-depleted hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated donors. Among the 75 donor-recipient pairs, 60 were HLA 10/10 matched and 15 had some mismatches at HLA-C. Transplants from KIR haplotype B/x group donors showed significantly higher overall survival rates compared with those from KIR haplotype A/A donors (relative risk (RR) 3.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-8.6), P=0.007). In the haplotype A/A group, a higher risk of acute GVHD (aGVHD) (RR 9.0 (95% CI 1.2-66.9), P=0.01), especially grade III-IV aGVHD (P=0.006), was observed when the donor was homozygous for the full-length expressed KIR2DS4*00101 allele. Real-time PCR showed that a high expression of inhibitory KIR (2DL1 and 3DL1) in the early stages (<90 days) after transplantation correlated with the development of aGVHD (z=2.558, P=0.011). Our findings indicated a significant association of full-length KIR2DS4 or KIR2DL1/3DL1 expression with the occurrence of aGVHD. In aggregate these results suggested that combining KIR and HLA genotyping could help in the selection of transplant donors and improve the outcome of transplantation.

The AKIN criteria had less ability to identify patients as having the lowest category, stage 1 (analogous to RIFLE risk): 33% (37%) in m-allo, 23% (32%) in nm-allo and 8.3% (16.7%) in auto. Cox regression showed that categories higher than the intermediate stage were independent predictors of mortality in all three definitions. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves showed that both definition systems had similar and significant ability to predict mortality (0.643-0.649 in m-allo and 0.734-0.766 in nm-allo, respectively). These abilities of the conventional graded criteria were comparable with those of the RIFLE criteria. The RIFLE criteria have greater sensitivity than the AKIN criteria to identify patients with AKI and therefore are more favorable as a uniform definition system for post-SCT AKI. However, the RIFLE criteria do not improve on the clinical relevance of the conventional graded criteria.","['Ando, M', 'Mori, J', 'Ohashi, K', 'Akiyama, H', 'Morito, T', 'Tsuchiya, K', 'Nitta, K', 'Sakamaki, H']","['Ando M', 'Mori J', 'Ohashi K', 'Akiyama H', 'Morito T', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Nitta K', 'Sakamaki H']","['Department of Nephrology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. nephrol@cick.jp or hdcn@cick.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*mortality', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*mortality/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/12/29 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2009377 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.377 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2010 Sep;45(9):1427-34. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.377.

We have developed a new protocol for HLA-mismatched (including haploidentical) HSCT using G-CSF-primed BM plus G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs without in vitro T-cell depletion. A total of 36 patients diagnosed with high-risk MDS (RAEB (refractory anemia with excess blasts) or RAEBt (RAEB in transformation)) underwent transplantation from HLA-mismatched family donors. All patients achieved sustained myeloid engraftment. The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) was 60% and that of grades III and IV aGVHD was 15%. The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 56%. After a median follow-up of 17 months, 4 patients had relapsed and died and 25 patients were still alive. The 2-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 65%. Patients transplanted within 7 months of diagnosis had better LFS (89 vs 43% ). Severe aGVHD decreased the LFS significantly by increasing non-relapse mortality (NRM). This study confirms that HLA-mismatched HSCT is a treatment option for MDS.

To analyze the leukemogenic process and to create model mice for t(17;19)-positive leukemia, we generated inducible knock-in (iKI) mice for E2A-HLF. Despite the induced expression of E2A-HLF in the hematopoietic tissues, no disease was developed during the long observation period, indicating that additional gene alterations are required to develop leukemia. To elucidate this process, E2A-HLF iKI and control littermates were subjected to retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Virus infection induced acute leukemias in E2A-HLF iKI mice with higher morbidity and mortality than in control mice. Inverse PCR detected three common integration sites specific for E2A-HLF iKI leukemic mice, which induced overexpression of zinc-finger transcription factors: growth factor independent 1 (Gfi1), zinc-finger protein subfamily 1A1 isoform a (Zfp1a1, also known as Ikaros) and zinc-finger protein 521 (Zfp521). Interestingly, tumors with Zfp521 integration exclusively showed B-lineage ALL, which corresponds to the phenotype of human t(17;19)-positive leukemia. In addition, ZNF521 (human counterpart of Zfp521) was found to be overexpressed in human leukemic cell lines harboring t(17;19). Moreover, both iKI for E2A-HLF and transgenic for Zfp521 mice frequently developed B-lineage ALL. These results indicate that a set of transcription factors promote leukemic transformation of E2A-HLF-expressing hematopoietic progenitors and suggest that aberrant expression of Zfp521/ZNF521 may be clinically relevant to t(17;19)-positive B-lineage ALL.","['Yamasaki, N', 'Miyazaki, K', 'Nagamachi, A', 'Koller, R', 'Oda, H', 'Miyazaki, M', 'Sasaki, T', 'Honda, Z-i', 'Wolff, L', 'Inaba, T', 'Honda, H']","['Yamasaki N', 'Miyazaki K', 'Nagamachi A', 'Koller R', 'Oda H', 'Miyazaki M', 'Sasaki T', 'Honda ZI', 'Wolff L', 'Inaba T', 'Honda H']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (COPRS protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (zinc finger protein 521, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009475 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.475 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Apr 1;29(13):1963-75. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.475.

Nonetheless, a minority of patients are resistant or intolerant to imatinib; proposed alternative strategies include imatinib dose escalation, switching to a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor or, in rare instances, allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The aim of this review is to aid clinicians in the recognition, investigation and appropriate treatment of imatinib resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: Although response definitions are still being refined, there is emerging evidence that earlier intervention with next-line therapy is associated with better outcomes, reinforcing the importance of careful monitoring in all patients and mutation analysis in those losing response. Imatinib dose escalation can produce sustained responses in patients resistant to standard dosing, but is frequently poorly tolerated. Dasatinib and nilotinib are both effective next-line therapies, with clinical studies confirming a small number of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations that confer insensitivity to one or both of these agents. SUMMARY: The development of imatinib resistance, as defined by the revised European LeukemiaNet criteria, should trigger a careful review of drug adherence or recent interruptions, a repeat bone marrow aspirate and mutation analysis. In the absence of clinically relevant mutations, the choice between dasatinib and nilotinib should be guided by the potential adverse effects specific to each drug and relevant comorbidities.","['Osborn, Michael', 'Hughes, Timothy']","['Osborn M', 'Hughes T']","['Directorate of Haematology, Australia, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366bcb [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Mar;17(2):97-103. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366bcb.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283366bcb [doi],,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated human antibodies to alpha6beta4 to further evaluate its role in tumor cell signaling. Biochemical characterization indicated these antibodies are specific for alpha6beta4, recognize distinct epitopes and have low nanomolar affinities for both human and murine protein. The antibodies demonstrated differing effects on alpha6beta4-mediated cellular adhesion, highlighting the existence of different functional epitopes on alpha6beta4. Interestingly however both antibodies blocked adhesion-independent growth in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Antibody induced apoptosis and inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling were also observed within the context of matrix adhesion. Enhanced inhibitory effects were observed when the alpha6beta4 antibodies were used in combination with antibodies to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or erythoblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2). These findings illustrate a role for both the adhesive and signaling functions of alpha6beta4 in breast cancer cell survival.

It was previously shown that the expression of gene coding for the hyperfusogenic gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein (GALV.fus) can efficiently kill leukemic cells. However, target killing effect of GALV.fus on leukemia cells may be limited. Viral vectors, such as retroviruses and adenoviruses, have been developed to deliver heterologous genes into tumors in vivo, but these vectors have some limitations for gene therapy of leukemia. Another virus that has drawn interest as a gene transfer vector is the Sindbis virus. Sindbis virus efficiently infects human tumor cells through the high-affinity 67 kDa Laminin receptor. We found that Laminin-R was obviously expressed in HL-60 and primary human AML cells, but weakly expressed in K562 cells and blood samples of normal human. So we reasoned that Sindbis-virus-based vectors might be ideal for target gene transfer of GALV.fus to acute myeloid leukemic cell. It was shown that Sindbis virus efficiently transduced human acute myeloid leukemic cells with high expression of Laminin-R and exhibited potent cytopathic potential. What is more, we found that CFU-GMs were significantly reduced after Sindbis virus carrying GALV.fus transduced human primary AML cells. Sindbis virus carrying GALV.fus was active against human AML xenografts in vivo. Taken together, we concluded that Sindbis virus carrying GALV.fus may be an useful strategy for gene therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Tan, Li', 'Xu, Bing', 'Liu, Ranyi', 'Liu, Haibo', 'Tan, Huo', 'Huang, Wenlin']","['Tan L', 'Xu B', 'Liu R', 'Liu H', 'Tan H', 'Huang W']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Sindbis Virus/*genetics']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10879 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.9.5.10879 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Mar 1;9(5):350-7. doi: 10.4161/cbt.9.5.10879.

Here, we show that the Shc family adapter p66Shc uncouples the B-cell receptor (BCR) from the Erk- and Akt-dependent survival pathways, thereby enhancing B-cell apoptosis. p66Shc expression was found to be profoundly impaired in CLL B cells compared with normal peripheral B cells. Moreover, significant differences in p66Shc expression were observed in patients with favorable or unfavorable prognosis, based on the mutational status of IGHV genes, with the lowest expression in the unfavorable prognosis group. Analysis of the expression of genes implicated in apoptosis defects of CLL showed an alteration in the balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family in patients with CLL. Reconstitution experiments in CLL B cells, together with data obtained on B cells from p66Shc(-/-) mice, showed that p66Shc expression correlates with a bias in the Bcl-2 family toward proapoptotic members. The data identify p66Shc as a novel regulator of B-cell apoptosis which attenuates BCR-dependent survival signals and modulates Bcl-2 family expression.

Using methylated CpG island amplification/DNA promoter microarray, we identified several EPH receptor and EPHRIN genes as potential hypermethylation targets in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We subsequently studied the DNA methylation status of the Eph/ephrin family by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Hypermethylation of EPHA2, -A4, -A5, -A6, -A7, -A10, EPHB1, -B2, -B3, -B4, EFNA1, -A3, -A5, and EFNB1 and -B2 genes was detected in leukemia cell lines and primary ALL bone marrow samples. Expression analysis of EPHB4, EFNB2, and EFNA5 genes demonstrated that DNA methylation was associated with gene silencing. We cloned the promoter region of EPHB4 and demonstrated that promoter hypermethylation can result in EPHB4 transcriptional silencing. Restoration of EPHB4 expression by lentiviral transduction resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death in Raji cells in which EPHB4 is methylated and silenced. Finally, we demonstrated that phosphorylated Akt is down-regulated in Raji cells transduced with EPHB4. These results suggest that epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of EPH/EPHRIN family genes contributes to ALL pathogenesis and that EPHB4 can function as a tumor suppressor in ALL.","['Kuang, Shao-Qing', 'Bai, Hao', 'Fang, Zhi-Hong', 'Lopez, Gonzalo', 'Yang, Hui', 'Tong, Weigang', 'Wang, Zack Z', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Kuang SQ', 'Bai H', 'Fang ZH', 'Lopez G', 'Yang H', 'Tong W', 'Wang ZZ', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a T-cell malignancy causatively associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). To determine the role of caveolin-1 in leukemogenesis, we examined caveolin-1 expression levels in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. These cells expressed high levels of caveolin-1 compared with uninfected T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Caveolin-1-positive ATL cells were detected in ATL lymph nodes and skin lesions, and caveolin-1 was also detected in the plasma of patients with ATL. Infection of a human T-cell line, an epithelial cell line, and normal PBMCs with HTLV-1 induced caveolin-1 expression. The viral protein Tax transcriptionally activated caveolin-1 gene through nuclear factor-kappaB and cAMP response element binding protein signal pathways. HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, and ATL cells are known to be resistant to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-induced growth inhibition. Caveolin-1 was colocalized with TGF-beta type I receptor in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and suppressed TGF-beta signaling. Caveolin-1 knockdown in an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line exhibited susceptibility to TGF-beta. Thus, we describe a new function for Tax, repression of TGF-beta signaling through caveolin-1 expression, which may play a critical role in ATL leukemogenesis.","['Sawada, Shigeki', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Tanji, Hiroe', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Uchihara, Jun-Nosuke', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Uezato, Hiroshi', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Sasai, Ken', 'Burgering, Boudewijn M T', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Sunakawa, Hajime', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Sawada S', 'Ishikawa C', 'Tanji H', 'Nakachi S', 'Senba M', 'Okudaira T', 'Uchihara JN', 'Taira N', 'Ohshiro K', 'Yamada Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Uezato H', 'Ohshima K', 'Sasai K', 'Burgering BM', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Fujii M', 'Sunakawa H', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Caveolin 1/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56632-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-240044 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 18;115(11):2220-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-240044.

ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL also has multiple ( approximately 6 per case) copy number alterations (CNAs) as revealed by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Recurrent CNAs are probably ""driver"" events contributing critically to clonal diversification and selection, but at diagnosis, their developmental timing is ""buried"" in the leukemia's covert natural history. This conundrum can be resolved with twin pairs. We identified and compared CNAs in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins with concordant ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL and 1 pair discordant for ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL. We compared, within each pair, CNAs classified as potential ""driver"" or ""passenger"" mutations based upon recurrency and, where known, gene function. An average of 5.1 (range 3-11) CNAs (excluding immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor alterations) were identified per case. All ""driver"" CNAs (total of 32) were distinct within each of the 5 twin pairs with concordant ALL. ""Driver"" CNAs in another twin with ALL were all absent in the shared ETV6-RUNX1-positive preleukemic clone of her healthy co-twin.

In the current work, we examined other possible signaling pathways that may also contribute to APAP hepatotoxicity. APAP treatment to mice caused glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activation and translocation to mitochondria during the initial phase of APAP-induced liver injury ( approximately 1 h). The silencing of GSK-3beta, but not Akt-2 (protein kinase B) or glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha (GSK-3alpha), using antisense significantly protected mice from APAP-induced liver injury. The silencing of GSK-3beta affected several key pathways important in conferring protection against APAP-induced liver injury. APAP treatment was observed to promote the loss of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL, rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis) in liver. The silencing of GSK-3beta decreased the loss of hepatic GCL, and promoted greater GSH recovery in liver following APAP treatment. Silencing JNK1 and -2 also prevented the loss of GCL. APAP treatment also resulted in GSK-3beta translocation to mitochondria and the degradation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in mitochondrial membranes in liver. The silencing of GSK-3beta reduced Mcl-1 degradation caused by APAP treatment. The silencing of GSK-3beta also resulted in an inhibition of the early phase (0-2 h), and blunted the late phase (after 4 h) of JNK activation and translocation to mitochondria in liver following APAP treatment. Taken together our results suggest that activation of GSK-3beta is a key mediator of the initial phase of APAP-induced liver injury through modulating GCL and Mcl-1 degradation, as well as JNK activation in liver.","['Shinohara, Mie', 'Ybanez, Maria D', 'Win, Sanda', 'Than, Tin Aung', 'Jain, Shilpa', 'Gaarde, William A', 'Han, Derick', 'Kaplowitz, Neil']","['Shinohara M', 'Ybanez MD', 'Win S', 'Than TA', 'Jain S', 'Gaarde WA', 'Han D', 'Kaplowitz N']","['University of Southern California Research Center for Liver Diseases, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089-9121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/16 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)64464-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.054999 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Mar 12;285(11):8244-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.054999.

MCCs and some other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinomas, frequently harbour Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA. The purpose of the study was to investigate the frequency of second cancers following the diagnosis of MCC. We studied the incidence of second primary cancers after the diagnosis of MCC from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1979-2006. Among the 172 MCC patients identified a total of 34 second primary cancers were detected in 30 individuals after the diagnosis of MCC. Female MCC patients were diagnosed with 25 subsequent cancers (SIR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.52-3.47; p<0.001) and male patients with 9 cancers (SIR, 2.32, 95% CI, 1.06-4.40; p<0.05). The MCC patients had an increased risk for a subsequent cancer (any site) compared to age-, gender- and calendar period-matched general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-3.27). The risks for basal cell carcinoma of the skin (O=11), SIR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.74-6.22 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (O=2), SIR, 17.9; 95% CI, 2.16-64.6 were significantly elevated. The SIRs for an overall second primary cancer risk did not change markedly with time since the diagnosis of MCC. We conclude that patients diagnosed with MCC have an increased risk for a second cancer. This risk may in part result from shared etiological factors between MCC and other tumour types, such as immunosuppression or possibly Merkel cell polyomavirus infection.","['Koljonen, Virve', 'Kukko, Heli', 'Tukiainen, Erkki', 'Bohling, Tom', 'Sankila, Risto', 'Joensuu, Heikki', 'Pukkala, Eero']","['Koljonen V', 'Kukko H', 'Tukiainen E', 'Bohling T', 'Sankila R', 'Joensuu H', 'Pukkala E']","['Department of Plastic Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. virve.koljonen@hus.fi <virve.koljonen@hus.fi>']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/epidemiology', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2009/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(09)00186-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2009.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2010 Feb;34(1):62-5. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.12.007.

Despite this, little is known about the immunophenotypic features of the distinct diagnostic categories of SM. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immunophenotypic characteristics of bone marrow (BM) mast cells (MCs) of different subtypes of SM. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 123 patients with different subtypes of SM and 92 controls were analyzed for a broad panel of immunophenotypic markers by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Three clearly different maturation-associated immunophenotypic profiles were found for BMMCs in SM. These different profiles were associated with both genetic markers of the disease and its clinical behavior. BMMCs from poor-prognosis categories of SM (aggressive SM and MC leukemia) typically showed an immature phenotype with clonal involvement of all myeloid lineages by the D816V stem cell growth factor receptor gene (KIT) mutation. In turn, a mature activated versus resting BMMC immunophenotype was commonly found among patients with good-prognosis subtypes of SM depending on whether they carried (indolent SM and clonal MC activation disorders) or not (well differentiated SM) the D816V KIT mutation. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow MCs from SM show 3 different maturation-related immunophenotypic profiles that are associated with both the genetic markers of the disease and its clinical behavior.","['Teodosio, Cristina', 'Garcia-Montero, Andres C', 'Jara-Acevedo, Maria', 'Sanchez-Munoz, Laura', 'Alvarez-Twose, Ivan', 'Nunez, Rosa', 'Schwartz, Lawrence B', 'Walls, Andrew F', 'Escribano, Luis', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Teodosio C', 'Garcia-Montero AC', 'Jara-Acevedo M', 'Sanchez-Munoz L', 'Alvarez-Twose I', 'Nunez R', 'Schwartz LB', 'Walls AF', 'Escribano L', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio General de Citometria, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer/IBMCC (CSIC-USAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,['0 (Stem Cell Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mastocytosis/*genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Factor/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2009/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(09)01547-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.020 [doi]']",ppublish,"J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2010 Mar;125(3):719-26, 726.e1-726.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.020.

His viral load was high (40,112 copies/ml) and CD4 count low (287cells/mm(3)). After biopsy-exeresis, histology and an immunohistochemical study confirmed the diagnosis of GS. Chemotherapy similar to that of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) completed the treatment. The remission was complete at 5 years. DISCUSSION: Only one case of intra-oral GS associated to HIV infection has been reported so far. The clinical and radiological presentation is unspecific. Histology proves the diagnosis. The treatment is comparable to that of AML.

Previous studies demonstrated that expression of this protein is essential for differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines and primary stem cells into megakaryocytes. Here we show that tescalcin is expressed in primary human granulocytes and is upregulated in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that have been induced to differentiate along the granulocytic lineage. However, during induced macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells the expression of tescalcin is downregulated. The decrease in expression is associated with a rapid drop in tescalcin mRNA level, whereas upregulation occurs via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Tescalcin is necessary for HL-60 differentiation into granulocytes as its knockdown by shRNA impairs the ability of HL-60 cells to acquire the characteristic phenotypes such as phagocytic activity and generation of reactive oxygen species measured by respiratory burst assay. Both up- and downregulation of tescalcin require activation of the MEK/ERK cascade. It appears that commitment of HL-60 cells toward granulocytic versus macrophage-like lineage correlates with expression of tescalcin and kinetics of ERK activation. In retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation, the activation of ERK and upregulation of tescalcin occurs slowly (16-48 h). In contrast, in PMA-induced macrophage-like differentiation the activation of ERK is rapid (15-30 min) and tescalcin is downregulated. These studies indicate that tescalcin is one of the key gene products that is involved in switching differentiation program in some cell types.","['Levay, Konstantin', 'Slepak, Vladlen Z']","['Levay K', 'Slepak VZ']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101-6189, USA. klevay@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TESC protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00008-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Apr 15;316(7):1254-62. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.007.

However, historically, the mutation rate (mu) has been difficult to measure directly, and increased cell turnover or selection could provide an alternative explanation. We recently developed an assay for mu using PIG-A as a sentinel gene and estimated that its average value is 10.6 x 10(-7) mutations per cell division in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from normal donors. Here we have measured mu in human malignancies and found that it was elevated in cell lines derived from T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma in transformed phase, and 2 plasma cell neoplasms. In contrast, mu was much lower in a marginal zone lymphoma cell line and 5 other plasma cell neoplasms. The highest mu value that we measured, 3286 x 10(-7), is 2 orders of magnitude above the range we have observed in non-malignant human cells.

Although frequent loss of heterozygosity around the Pten locus and plausible involvement of epigenetic silencing have been reported in radiation-induced thymic lymphomas, the proportion of lymphomas with inactivated Pten and the spectrum of causal aberrations have not been extensively characterized. Here, we assessed the mode of Pten inactivation by comprehensive analysis of the expression and alteration of Pten in 23 radiation-induced thymic lymphomas developed in B6C3F1 mice. We found no evidence for methylation-associated silencing of Pten; rather, complex structural abnormalities comprised of missense and nonsense mutations, 1- and 3-bp insertions, and focal deletions were identified in 8 of 23 lymphomas (35%). Sequencing of deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant V(D)J recombination and microhomology-mediated rearrangement were responsible for the focal deletions. Seven of the 8 lymphomas had biallelic alterations, and 4 of them did not express Pten protein. These Pten aberrations coincided with downstream Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Pten inactivation is frequently biallelic and is caused by a variety of structural abnormalities (rather than by epigenetic silencing) and is involved in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis.","['Yamaguchi, Yu', 'Takabatake, Takashi', 'Kakinuma, Shizuko', 'Amasaki, Yoshiko', 'Nishimura, Mayumi', 'Imaoka, Tatsuhiko', 'Yamauchi, Kazumi', 'Shang, Yi', 'Miyoshi-Imamura, Tomoko', 'Nogawa, Hiroyuki', 'Kobayashi, Yoshiro', 'Shimada, Yoshiya']","['Yamaguchi Y', 'Takabatake T', 'Kakinuma S', 'Amasaki Y', 'Nishimura M', 'Imaoka T', 'Yamauchi K', 'Shang Y', 'Miyoshi-Imamura T', 'Nogawa H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Shimada Y']","['Department of Biology, Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Yayoicho, Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8522, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Gene Expression', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(10)00003-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2010 Apr 1;686(1-2):30-8. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.12.011.

Here we sought to identify sites of neurodegeneration using microglial reactivity as an indirect marker and to characterize microglial activation during disease progression. Using a panel of microglial antibodies including Iba1, OX-42, ED1, and anti-ferritin, we have studied the response of microglial cells to neonatal CNS infection with PVC-211 at post-infection survival times 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. We found that microglial activation occurred primarily in the spinal cord and brainstem where it gradually increased in intensity over the time course of this study. Other brain areas were relatively unremarkable in their microglial reaction to viral infection within this time frame. However, the presence of activated microglial cells was not correlated directly with the presence of viral glycoprotein (gp70), which was expressed in endothelial cells throughout the CNS. Although double-labeling of microglia with Iba1 and ED1 revealed numerous actively phagocytic microglia during disease progression, not all activated microglia were ED1-positive. In addition to the intense microglial activation, we found increased ferritin expression sporadically throughout the virus-infected brain. The ferritin-positive cells were mostly microglia that exhibited dystrophic changes and likely represented a degenerating subpopulation of microglial cells. Thus, activated microglia can co-exist with degenerating microglia in the same brain region. We attempted to localize degenerating neurons or neurites using Fluoro-Jade, anti-tau, and anti-alpha synuclein staining, but none of these procedures yielded results to indicate obvious neuronal pathology. We conclude that the visualization of microglial activation is a more sensitive measure of neuronal perturbations than direct detection of neuronal pathology which may be subtle and not produce overt degenerative changes.","['Xue, Qing-Shan', 'Yang, Cui', 'Hoffman, Paul M', 'Streit, Wolfgang J']","['Xue QS', 'Yang C', 'Hoffman PM', 'Streit WJ']","['Department of Neuroscience, PO Box 100244, University of Florida College of Medicine, McKnight Brain Institute, Gainesville, FL 32610-0244, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Central Nervous System Infections/*physiopathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Ferritins/metabolism', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Microglia/*physiology', 'Nerve Degeneration/*physiopathology', 'Neurites/physiology', 'Neurons/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/*physiopathology', 'Spinal Cord/physiopathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*physiopathology']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(09)02787-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2009.12.089 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2010 Mar 10;1319:131-41. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.12.089.

RESULTS: In a cohort of 101 patients with a median follow-up of 29 (1-234) months, sFLC levels were found to be high in 55 patients (54.5%). An abnormal FLCR was found in 30 patients (29.7%). FISH-based genetic risk groups did not differ significantly with respect to sFLC and FLCR (P > 0.05). Median time to first treatment was shorter in patients with high sFLC levels (P = 0.02). Median overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with high sFLC levels (P = 0.01) and abnormal FLCR (P = 0.05). In patients with early stage disease, median OS was shorter in high sFLC (P = 0.03) and abnormal FLCR groups (P = 0.048). A relationship was observed between abnormal sFLC levels and CD38 positivity on logistic regression analysis (P = 0.003; OR: 4.44; 95% CI: 1.66-11.8). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the adverse prognostic impact of high sFLC levels and abnormal FLCR with regard to survival in CLL, even in early stage patients. Prospective studies are warranted to validate the adverse impact of sFLC and FLCR on clinical outcome.","['Yegin, Zeynep A', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde N', 'Yagci, Munci']","['Yegin ZA', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Yagci M']","['Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey. zyegin@gazi.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*blood', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1412 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01412.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 May;84(5):406-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01412.x.

Our study aims to clarify the clinical characteristics of this disease and factors influencing patient prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 33 cases of Trichosporon fungemia (TF) in patients with hematologic malignancies treated at our collaborating five hospitals in Japan between 1992 and 2007. RESULTS: The majority of these patients had acute leukemia (82%), neutropenia (85%), and a history of intensive chemotherapy (91%). TF occurred as a breakthrough infection during antifungal therapy in 30 patients (91%), 18 of whom were receiving micafungin. The surveillance cultures of most patients were negative for Trichosporon. Only a few patients exhibited elevated levels of 1,3-beta-d-glucan before positive blood culture. Twenty-five patients (76%) died of this infection. The resolution of infection was associated with neutrophil recovery (P = 0.0001), absence of hyperglycemia (P = 0.023), and azole inclusive therapy (P = 0.031). Survival was significantly longer in patients receiving antifungal therapies containing azole than in those who did not receive azole (P = 0.0034). CONCLUSIONS: At present, the diagnosis of invasive trichosporonosis depends on blood culture studies, and the mortality of this disease is high; however, azole therapy and control of blood glucose level, together with hematopoietic recovery could help in improving the clinical outcome. When we use antifungals lacking anti-Trichosporon activity, sufficient care should be taken to prevent the development of breakthrough trichosporonosis.","['Suzuki, Kei', 'Nakase, Kazunori', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Kohara, Tadahiro', 'Sugawara, Yumiko', 'Shibazaki, Tetsunori', 'Oka, Kouji', 'Tsukada, Tetsuya', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Suzuki K', 'Nakase K', 'Kyo T', 'Kohara T', 'Sugawara Y', 'Shibazaki T', 'Oka K', 'Tsukada T', 'Katayama N']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/drug therapy/*mortality/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trichosporon/*isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1410 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01410.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 May;84(5):441-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01410.x.

The subset analysis showed that T-cell lymphoma had a significantly better response with THP-COP, whereas no such difference was observed in B-cell lymphoma. The aim of this study is to confirm the efficacy of THP-COP in the treatment of T-cell lymphoma. METHODS: We underwent a multicenter phase II study of THP-COP as a first-line treatment for T-cell lymphoma. The overall response rate, survival period, and toxicity were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Seventeen patients had peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), including nine of PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and eight of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Thirty-six patients had adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), including 20 of acute type and 16 of lymphoma type. A treatment response was obtained in 35 (66%) patients, including 17 (32%) complete responses. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were 14.3 months and 5.2 months, respectively. Patients with ATLL showed a tendency to obtain low response rate (61% vs. 77%, P = 0.27) and had a significantly inferior OS (13.3 vs. 28.6 months, P = 0.04) and PFS (4.6 vs. 8.1 months, P = 0.01) in comparison with PTCL. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 72%, 34%, and 58% of the patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 51% and grade 3 non-hematological toxicities in 2-9% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of THP-COP is equivalent to that of CHOP for the first-line therapy in T-cell lymphoma.","['Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Maeda, Koichi', 'Matsuoka, Hitoshi', 'Suzushima, Hitoshi', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Shibata, Keisuke', 'Tamura, Kazuo']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Suzumiya J', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Maeda K', 'Matsuoka H', 'Suzushima H', 'Tsukada J', 'Shibata K', 'Tamura K']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. yasushi@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VEP-THP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1411 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01411.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 May;84(5):391-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01411.x.

Since MTX prevents tumor cells from proliferating by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), DHFR expression is a key determinant of resistance to MTX in malignant hematological tumor cells. The antiproliferative effect of MTX was significantly enhanced by the knockdown of DHFR expression by siRNA in Jurkat cells. Therefore, a novel strategy down-regulating DHFR expression seems promising for enhancing sensitivity to MTX. We found that SU9516, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, reduced the expression of both DHFR mRNA and protein. Moreover, we found that DHFR promoter activity was attenuated by SU9516 dependent on the E2F site. Finally, pretreatment with SU9516 significantly enhanced sensitivity to MTX in a colony formation assay. We conclude that a combination of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and MTX may be useful for overcoming resistance to MTX.","['Uchiyama, Hitoji', 'Sowa, Yoshihiro', 'Wakada, Miki', 'Yogosawa, Mayumi', 'Nakanishi, Ryoko', 'Horinaka, Mano', 'Shimazaki, Chihiro', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Sakai, Toshiyuki']","['Uchiyama H', 'Sowa Y', 'Wakada M', 'Yogosawa M', 'Nakanishi R', 'Horinaka M', 'Shimazaki C', 'Taniwaki M', 'Sakai T']","['Department of Molecular-Targeting Cancer Prevention, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (6-((3-chloro)anilino)-2-(isopropyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-9-isopropylpurine)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (SU 9516)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1449 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01449.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Mar;101(3):728-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01449.x.

Therefore, it is regarded as one of the promising tools in gene therapy. However, there are still some obstacles, such as low efficiency of cellular uptake and instability in vivo, in its application. Taking advantage of the mechanism of Moloney mouse leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (RT), we investigate the construction of a novel ssDNA expression vector in this study. In order to improve the expression efficiency, the mmlv-rt gene and ODN-PMT (an oligodeoxynucleotide including other essential sequences for generating ssDNA) were cloned into a single plasmid under the control of 2 separated promoters. The ability of the vector to generate specific 10-23 DNAzyme in mammalian cell was tested by constructing a tryptophan-aspartate-containing coat protein (taco) gene-specific 10-23 DNAzyme expression plasmid. The potential of the expressed 10-23 DNAzyme to suppress TACO expression was also investigated. Our results indicated that this vector generates desired 10-23 DNAzyme in mammalian cells. The expressed 10-23 DNAzyme targeting taco gene can reduce TACO expression both at mRNA level (by 78.26%) and at protein level (by 75.30%).","['Li, Junming', 'Wang, Na', 'Luo, Qing', 'Wan, Lagen']","['Li J', 'Wang N', 'Luo Q', 'Wan L']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, People's Republic of China. lisir361@163.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oligonucleotides,Oligonucleotides,101188415,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Catalytic)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (RNA-cleaving DNA 10-23)', '145420-64-0 (coronin proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Catalytic/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*genetics/physiology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/01/12 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/oli.2009.0217 [doi]'],ppublish,Oligonucleotides. 2010 Apr;20(2):61-8. doi: 10.1089/oli.2009.0217.,10.1089/oli.2009.0217 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since it is a rare and heterogeneous form of acute leukemia with an allegedly poor outcome, there is no consensus on the best treatment approach in these patients. Our objective was to analyze the biological features and outcome of patients diagnosed with BAL in our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the EGIL system, we identified 21 cases (3.9%) of BAL from 535 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients in an 11-year period. RESULTS: There were ten cases of myeloid+B-lymphoid leukemia, eight cases of myeloid+T-lymphoid, one case of B+T-lymphoid and two cases of trilineage (myeloid+B+T-lymphoid leukemia). The complete remission (CR) rate with high-dose chemotherapy was 72% and overall survival at 5 years was 21%. Patients that received acute lymphoblastic leukemia-oriented chemotherapy had a higher CR rate compared with those who received acute myeloid leukemia-oriented chemotherapy (100% vs. 60%, P = .007). The white blood cell count at diagnosis was found to have statistically significant impact on survival. CONCLUSION: Despite the progress in the treatment of acute leukemia, the prognosis of BAL remains poor and treatment protocols devised explicitly for this entity should be investigated in prospective collaborative studies.","['Mikulic, Mirta', 'Batinic, Drago', 'Sucic, Mirna', 'Davidovic-Mrsic, Sanja', 'Dubravcic, Klara', 'Nemet, Damir', 'Serventi-Seiwerth, Ranka', 'Sertic, Dubravka', 'Labar, Boris']","['Mikulic M', 'Batinic D', 'Sucic M', 'Davidovic-Mrsic S', 'Dubravcic K', 'Nemet D', 'Serventi-Seiwerth R', 'Sertic D', 'Labar B']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. mpisk@mef.hr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2008/10/01 00:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1658-3876(08)50009-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50009-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2008 Oct-Dec;1(4):225-30. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50009-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Voreloxin is in clinical studies, as a single agent and in combination with cytarabine, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The preclinical studies reported here were performed to investigate the activity of voreloxin alone and in combination with cytarabine, in support of the clinical program. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Is single agent voreloxin active in preclinical models of AML? Does the combination of voreloxin and cytarabine enhance the activity of either agent alone? METHODS: Inhibition of proliferation was studied in three cancer cell lines: HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), MV4-11 (AML), and CCRF-CEM (Acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Combination index (CI) analysis established the effect of the drugs in combination. A mouse model of bone marrow ablation was used to investigate in vivo efficacy of the drugs alone and in combination. Peripheral white blood cell and platelet counts were followed to assess marrow impact and recovery. RESULTS: Voreloxin and cytarabine alone and in combination exhibited cytotoxic activity in human leukemia cell lines and in vivo. The two drugs had additive or synergistic activity in vitro and supra-additive activity in vivo. Bone marrow ablation was accompanied by reductions in peripheral white blood cells and platelets that were reversible within 1 week, consistent with the AML treatment paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: These data support ongoing clinical evaluation of voreloxin both alone and in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of AML.","['Scatena, Caroline D', 'Kumer, Jeffrey L', 'Arbitrario, Jennifer P', 'Howlett, Anthony R', 'Hawtin, Rachael E', 'Fox, Judith A', 'Silverman, Jeffrey A']","['Scatena CD', 'Kumer JL', 'Arbitrario JP', 'Howlett AR', 'Hawtin RE', 'Fox JA', 'Silverman JA']","['Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthyridines', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Thiazoles']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1234-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Oct;66(5):881-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1234-z.

Potential mechanisms have allowed both for overlapping and unique roles for these proteins because of their abilities to bind different proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, but it is unclear which of these mechanisms are important in an in vivo context. By generation of various genetic mouse models, we found that Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes die largely by a Bak-specific mechanism. In vivo deletion of Bak rescued the survival and developmental blocks of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes at the double-negative and single-positive stages. Transgenic overexpression of Bcl-2 and in vivo deletion of Bax or Bim were unable to rescue Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes. Thus, Mcl-1 functions in a unique pathway from Bcl-2 in T lymphocytes, likely because of its specific ability to bind and sequester proapoptotic Bak. Together, these data provide an in vivo model for Mcl-1 activity and present us with a greater understanding of the pathways that promote thymocyte survival.","['Dunkle, A', 'Dzhagalov, I', 'He, Y-W']","['Dunkle A', 'Dzhagalov I', 'He YW']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Deletion', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2009201 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.201 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 Jun;17(6):994-1002. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.201.

These studies show that self-renewing cells are abundant in T-ALL and comprise 0.1% to 15.9% of the T-ALL mass. Large-scale single-cell transplantation experiments established that T-ALLs can be initiated from a single cell and that leukemias exhibit wide differences in tumor-initiating potential.

For that purpose, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were stably transfected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) matrix protein (MA) GFP fusion constructs. To produce FSs, interleukins (ILs), IL-receptors (IL-Rs), and costimulatory molecules were fused to the glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchor acceptor sequence of CD16b and coexpressed along with MoMLV group-specific antigen-polymerase (gag-pol) in MA::GFP(+) HEK-293 cells. We show that IL-2 decorated but not control-decorated FSs specifically identify normal and malignant IL-2 receptor-positive (IL-2R(+)) lymphocytes by flow cytometry. In addition to cytokines and costimulatory molecules, FSs were also successfully decorated with the heterotrimeric IL-2Rs, allowing identification of IL-2(+) target cells. Specificity of binding was proven by complete inhibition with nonlabeled, soluble ligands. Moreover, IL-2R FSs efficiently neutralized soluble IL-2 and thus induced unresponsiveness of T cells receiving full activation stimuli via T-cell antigen receptor and CD28. FSs are technically simple, multivalent tools for assessing and blocking mono- and multisubunit immune receptor-ligand interactions with natural constituents in a plasma membrane context.","['Kueng, Hans J', 'Manta, Calin', 'Haiderer, Daniela', 'Leb, Victoria M', 'Schmetterer, Klaus G', 'Neunkirchner, Alina', 'Byrne, Ruth A', 'Scheinecker, Clemens', 'Steinberger, Peter', 'Seed, Brian', 'Pickl, Winfried F']","['Kueng HJ', 'Manta C', 'Haiderer D', 'Leb VM', 'Schmetterer KG', 'Neunkirchner A', 'Byrne RA', 'Scheinecker C', 'Steinberger P', 'Seed B', 'Pickl WF']","['Institute of Immunology, Center for Physiology, Pathophysiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Borschkegasse 8A, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/analysis/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Virion/*chemistry/genetics']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.09-137281 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.09-137281 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2010 May;24(5):1572-82. doi: 10.1096/fj.09-137281.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that formaldehyde exposure is associated with an increased risk of leukemia. However, the biological plausibility of these findings has been questioned because limited information is available on the ability of formaldehyde to disrupt hematopoietic function. Our objective was to determine if formaldehyde exposure disrupts hematopoietic function and produces leukemia-related chromosome changes in exposed humans. We examined the ability of formaldehyde to disrupt hematopoiesis in a study of 94 workers in China (43 exposed to formaldehyde and 51 frequency-matched controls) by measuring complete blood counts and peripheral stem/progenitor cell colony formation. Further, myeloid progenitor cells, the target for leukemogenesis, were cultured from the workers to quantify the level of leukemia-specific chromosome changes, including monosomy 7 and trisomy 8, in metaphase spreads of these cells. Among exposed workers, peripheral blood cell counts were significantly lowered in a manner consistent with toxic effects on the bone marrow and leukemia-specific chromosome changes were significantly elevated in myeloid blood progenitor cells. These findings suggest that formaldehyde exposure can have an adverse effect on the hematopoietic system and that leukemia induction by formaldehyde is biologically plausible, which heightens concerns about its leukemogenic potential from occupational and environmental exposures.","['Zhang, Luoping', 'Tang, Xiaojiang', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Ji, Zhiying', 'Shen, Min', 'Qiu, Chuangyi', 'Guo, Weihong', 'Liu, Songwang', 'Reiss, Boris', 'Freeman, Laura Beane', 'Ge, Yichen', 'Hubbard, Alan E', 'Hua, Ming', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Galvan, Noe', 'Ruan, Xiaolin', 'Alter, Blanche P', 'Xin, Kerry X', 'Li, Senhua', 'Moore, Lee E', 'Kim, Sungkyoon', 'Xie, Yuxuan', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Azuma, Mariko', 'Hauptmann, Michael', 'Xiong, Jun', 'Stewart, Patricia', 'Li, Laiyu', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Huang, Hanlin', 'Fraumeni, Joseph F Jr', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Lan, Qing']","['Zhang L', 'Tang X', 'Rothman N', 'Vermeulen R', 'Ji Z', 'Shen M', 'Qiu C', 'Guo W', 'Liu S', 'Reiss B', 'Freeman LB', 'Ge Y', 'Hubbard AE', 'Hua M', 'Blair A', 'Galvan N', 'Ruan X', 'Alter BP', 'Xin KX', 'Li S', 'Moore LE', 'Kim S', 'Xie Y', 'Hayes RB', 'Azuma M', 'Hauptmann M', 'Xiong J', 'Stewart P', 'Li L', 'Rappaport SM', 'Huang H', 'Fraumeni JF Jr', 'Smith MT', 'Lan Q']","['School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. luoping@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aneuploidy', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Carcinogens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['19/1/80 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0762 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Jan;19(1):80-8. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0762.,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0762 [doi],,,,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA CP010120-14/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2974570,,,['NIHMS246061'],,"['Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Jul;19(7):1882-4; author reply 1884-5.', 'PMID: 20615893', 'Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2018 Jan;27(1):119.

DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE and other electronic databases were performed (1950-2009). Reports were included if they were original epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia, followed a case-control or cohort design, and assessed at least one index of residential/household pesticide exposure/use. No language criteria were applied. DATA EXTRACTION: Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 17 identified studies, 15 were included in the meta-analysis. Exposures during pregnancy to unspecified residential pesticides (summary OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11; I2 = 66%), insecticides (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.80-2.32; I2 = 0%), and herbicides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.20-2.16; I2 = 0%) were positively associated with childhood leukemia. Exposures during childhood to unspecified residential pesticides (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.70; I2 = 4%) and insecticides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.33-1.95; I2 = 0%) were also positively associated with childhood leukemia, but there was no association with herbicides. CONCLUSIONS: Positive associations were observed between childhood leukemia and residential pesticide exposures. Further work is needed to confirm previous findings based on self-report, to examine potential exposure-response relationships, and to assess specific pesticides and toxicologically related subgroups of pesticides in more detail.","['Turner, Michelle C', 'Wigle, Donald T', 'Krewski, Daniel']","['Turner MC', 'Wigle DT', 'Krewski D']","['McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment, Institute of Population Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada. mturner@uottawa.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Pesticides)']",IM,"['Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2009/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.0900966 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2010 Jan;118(1):33-41. doi: 10.1289/ehp.0900966.,10.1289/ehp.0900966 [doi],,,,,,PMC2831964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test a hypothesis that EDCs regulate the functions of human dendritic cells, a front-line, immunoregulatory cell type in contact with the environment. METHODS: We investigated circulating myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from five subjects and measured their responses, with or without coculture with autologous T cells, to two common EDCs, nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (4-OP). EDC-associated cytokine responses, signaling events, and histone modifications were examined using ELISA, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, respectively. RESULTS: In all cases, mDCs treated with NP or 4-OP demonstrated increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) but decreased baseline and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (interleukin) (IL)-10 production; the increase in TNF-alpha was partially reversible by an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist. Activation of the MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathway marked the effect of NP on TNF-alpha expression, concomitant with enhanced levels of methyltranferase complex [mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat domain 5 (WDR5)] in the nucleus and of trimethylated H3K4, acetylated H3, and H4 at the TNFA gene locus. Further, up-regulated TNF-alpha expression was significantly suppressed in NP-treated mDCs by a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor. In the presence of NP-treated mDCs, T cells showed increased levels of IL-13 but decreased expression of interferon-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NP and 4-OP may have functional effects on the response of mDCs via, in part, the ER, MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and histone modifications, with subsequent influence on the T-cell cytokine responses.","['Hung, Chih-Hsing', 'Yang, San-Nan', 'Kuo, Po-Lin', 'Chu, Yu-Te', 'Chang, Hui-Wen', 'Wei, Wan-Ju', 'Huang, Shau-Ku', 'Jong, Yuh-Jyh']","['Hung CH', 'Yang SN', 'Kuo PL', 'Chu YT', 'Chang HW', 'Wei WJ', 'Huang SK', 'Jong YJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endocrine Disruptors)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '79F6A2ILP5 (nonylphenol)', '7DF2B8LH3P (4-octylphenol)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-13/biosynthesis', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phenols/toxicity', 'Receptors, Estrogen/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2009/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.0901011 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2010 Jan;118(1):67-72. doi: 10.1289/ehp.0901011.,10.1289/ehp.0901011 [doi],,,,,"['R01 AI052468/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI073610/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI073610/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2831970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the outcomes associated with AML continue to be poor, especially for those patients who are older or carry higher-risk disease. In recent years, extensive research has led to the development and study of novel agents which target AML by diverse and varied mechanisms. Among these are targeted therapeutics such as kinase inhibitors and oligonucleotide constructs. These aim to suppress the production or activity of proteins, such as FLT3 and BCL2, among others, and thus disrupt related signaling cascades essential for leukemogenesis and proliferation. In addition, other agents like flavopiridol appear to target the myeloid blast by various mechanisms including suppression of cyclin-dependent kinases and interference with nucleotide synthesis. Another class of novel therapies includes inhibitors of histone deacetylase, which cause growth arrest and apoptosis through histone acetylation and resultant conformational changes. Clinical trials are now studying these and other agents alone and in combination with traditional cytotoxic therapies, with some encouraging results. In this review, we aim to provide a summary of the preclinical and clinical investigations of selected promising agents currently under study.","['Fathi, Amir T', 'Grant, Steven', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Fathi AT', 'Grant S', 'Karp JE']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. afathi1@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(09)00186-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2009.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2010 Apr;36(2):142-50. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2009.12.004.

Effective control of EBL requires that the transmission routes of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection should be identified and intercepted based on scientific evidence. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the risk factors associated with within-herd transmission of BLV on infected dairy farms in Japan. Blood samples taken from 30 randomly selected adult cows at each of 139 dairy farms were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Information on herd management was collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Infected farms were defined as those with more than one ELISA-positive animal and accounted for 110 (79.1%) of the 139 farms in the study. Completed questionnaires obtained from 90 of these 110 farms were used for statistical analysis. Seroprevalence, which was defined as the proportions of animals that tested positive out of all animals tested on the farm, was 17.1%, 48.1%, and 68.5% for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively. A mixed logistic regression analysis implicated a loose housing system, dehorning, and a large number of horseflies in summer as risk factors (coefficient = 0.71, 1.11, and 0.82; p = 0.03, < 0.01, and 0.01, respectively) and feeding of colostrum to newborn calves from their dams as a protective factor (coefficient = -1.11, p = 0.03) against within-farm transmission of BLV on infected farms. CONCLUSION: Control of EBL in infected dairy farms in Japan will be improved by focusing particularly on these risk and protective factors.","['Kobayashi, Sota', 'Tsutsui, Toshiyuki', 'Yamamoto, Takehisa', 'Hayama, Yoko', 'Kameyama, Ken-ichiro', 'Konishi, Misako', 'Murakami, Kenji']","['Kobayashi S', 'Tsutsui T', 'Yamamoto T', 'Hayama Y', 'Kameyama K', 'Konishi M', 'Murakami K']","['Epidemiological Research Team, National Institute of Animal Health, 3-1-5, Kannondai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', '*Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Female', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-6-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-6-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2010 Jan 7;6:1. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-6-1.,10.1186/1746-6148-6-1 [doi],20100107,,,,,PMC2835688,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, virtually all patients with CLL relapse from chemoimmmunotherapy and current available therapies are not curative. Identifying therapies that effectively eliminate CLL cells and lack immunesuppression represent an exciting new therapeutic approach. IMiDs are a class of immunomodulating drugs that increase T-cell and NK-cell directed killing of tumor cells. The first generation molecule is thalidomide followed by a second generation molecule lenalidomide that lacks neurotoxicity and is being explored more extensively in clinical trials. Lenalidomide has been shown to benefit patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and lymphoma. Initial reports in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL have shown promising responses. In a subset of patients with CLL complete responses have been noted. Subsequent studies, however, have suggested that this class of drug can also have serious and potentially life-threatening side effects including myelosuppression, tumor flare reaction and in a small subset of patients tumor lysis syndrome. Tumor flare with both thalidomide and lenalidomide appear to be disease specific to CLL and may reflect clinical manifestation of CLL tumor cell activation. As a consequence of these disease specific effects, the optimal safe dose of lenalidomide in CLL remains to be determined but appears to be lower than that tolerated in other B-cell malignancies. To date, biomarkers for response remain poorly defined and the relationship of clinical benefit to tumor flare is uncertain. This review examines the existing literature on the use of IMiDs in patients with CLL and provides suggestions for future research in this area.","['Awan, Farrukh T', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Hu, Weihong', 'Lucas, Margaret', 'Fischer, Beth', 'Byrd, John C']","['Awan FT', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lapalombella R', 'Hu W', 'Lucas M', 'Fischer B', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428190903350405 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Jan;51(1):27-38. doi: 10.3109/10428190903350405.,10.3109/10428190903350405 [doi],,66,,,"['P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3696187,,,['NIHMS474260'],,,,,,,,,,,,

IDA and DOX SLNs were developed from warm microemulsion precursors comprising emulsifying wax as the oil phase, and polyoxyl 20-stearyl ether (Brij 78) and D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (Vitamin E TPGS) as the surfactants. Anionic ion-pairing agents, sodium taurodeoxycholate (STDC) and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), were used to neutralize the charges of the cationic anthracyclines and enhance entrapment of the drugs in the SLN. The in-vitro cytotoxicity results showed that the IC50 value of DOX NPs was 9-fold lower than that of free DOX solution in resistant P388/ADR cell line. In contrast, free IDA had comparable IC50 values as IDA NPs in Pgp-overexpressing P388/ADR and HCT-15 cells. In the in-vivo P388/ADR leukemia mouse model, the median survival time of DOX NPs was significantly greater than that of free DOX, and controls. In contrast, free IDA was equally as effective as IDA NPs in P388 and Pgp-overexpressing HCT-15 mouse tumor models. The cell uptake of IDA formulated as free IDA and IDA NPs was comparable in Pgp-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, DOX NPs could overcome Pgp-mediated MDR both in-vitro in P388/ADR leukemia cells and in-vivo in the murine leukemia mouse model. The present study suggests that our SLNs may offer potential to deliver anticancer drugs for the treatment of Pgp-mediated MDR in leukemia; however, selection of target drug may be very important.","['Ma, Ping', 'Dong, Xiaowei', 'Swadley, Courtney L', 'Gupte, Anshul', 'Leggas, Markos', 'Ledebur, Harry C', 'Mumper, Russell J']","['Ma P', 'Dong X', 'Swadley CL', 'Gupte A', 'Leggas M', 'Ledebur HC', 'Mumper RJ']","['Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics, Center for Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/09 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2010/01/09 06:00'],"['2010/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2009.1021 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2009 Apr;5(2):151-61. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2009.1021.,,,,,,"['R01 CA115197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115197-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2805476,,,['NIHMS139362'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas, improvement in care has dramatically increased survival, the risk factors remain to be fully understood. The increasing incidence of childhood cancer in Florida may be associated with possible cancer clusters. We aimed, in this study, to identify and confirm possible childhood cancer clusters and their subtypes in the state of Florida. METHODS: We conducted purely spatial and space-time analyzes to assess any evidence of childhood malignancy clusters in the state of Florida using SaTScan. Data from the Florida Association of Pediatric Tumor Programs (FAPTP) for the period 2000-2007 were used in this analysis. RESULTS: In the purely spatial analysis, the relative risks (RR) of overall childhood cancer persisted after controlling for confounding factors in south Florida (SF) (RR = 1.36, P = 0.001) and northeastern Florida (NEF) (RR = 1.30, P = 0.01). Likewise, in the space-time analysis, there was a statistically significant increase in cancer rates in SF (RR = 1.52, P = 0.001) between 2006 and 2007. The purely spatial analysis of the cancer subtypes indicated a statistically significant increase in the rate of leukemia and brain/CNS cancers in both SF and NEF, P < 0.05. The space-time analysis indicated a statistically significant sizable increase in brain/CNS tumors (RR = 2.25, P = 0.02) for 2006-2007. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of spatial and space-time childhood cancer clustering in SF and NEF. This evidence is suggestive of the presence of possible predisposing factors in these cluster regions. Therefore, further study is needed to investigate these potential risk factors.","['Amin, Raid', 'Bohnert, Alexander', 'Holmes, Laurens', 'Rajasekaran, Ayyappan', 'Assanasen, Chatchawin']","['Amin R', 'Bohnert A', 'Holmes L', 'Rajasekaran A', 'Assanasen C']","['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida 32514, USA. ramin@uwf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Florida/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Space-Time Clustering']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22403 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Apr;54(4):511-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22403.,10.1002/pbc.22403 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,"['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Apr;54(4):493-4.

She rapidly achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR), at which point she switched therapy to a copy version of imatinib (Imatib). She received 400 mg/day of Imatib for 3 months, during which time her platelet count decreased from 250 x 10(9) to 105 x 10(9)/L and her hemoglobin count fell from 12.8 to 11 g/dL. The patient's total leukocyte count rose rapidly from 4 x 10(9) to 70 x 10(9)/L, and the CHR was lost. At this point, therapy was switched back to Glivec at 400 mg/day, and the CHR was rapidly regained. Furthermore, the patient achieved a major cytogenetic response by 6 months after reintroduction of Glivec. This case report suggests a difference in clinical efficacy between the authorized form of imatinib (Glivec) and the copy version of the drug (Imatib). The exact reasons for the observed difference in clinical efficacy are unknown, but likely relate to the use of alternative polymorphic forms of the drug.

Emerging data suggest a crucial involvement of the endothelial-specific Tie2 receptor and its antagonistic ligand Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in this process. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the soluble domain of the Tie2 receptor (sTie2)predicts outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). Serum levels of sTie2 and Ang-2 were measured by ELISA in 181 AML patients before conditioning for HSCT. The median follow-up time was 22 months after HSCT. Pre-HSCT sTie2 levels were significantly higher inpatients (median 2.2 (range 1.8-3.0) ng/mL) compared to healthy controls (1.3 (0.9-1.6); p<0.0001). Elevated sTie2 levels were independently associated with active AML but did not relate to cytogenetics/mutational status before transplantation. Logistic regression analysis identified elevated sTie2 (odds ratio (OR) 3.07 (95% confidence interval(CI; 1.56-6.04), p=0.001) as a strong predictor for disease relapse and poor overall survival after HSCT. In a multimarker approach the highest risk for relapse was observed inpatients with both elevated sTie2 and elevated Ang-2 (OR 4.07, (95% CI 1.79-9.25) p<0.0001), as well as patients with both elevated Ang-2 and elevated bone marrow blast count (OR 4.16, (95% CI 1.88-7.36) p<0.0001). Elevated serum sTie2 levels were related to active leukemia,correlated with the percentage of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, and independently predicted relapse in AML patients after allogeneic HSCT. Furthermore, our data indicate that Tie2 shedding and Ang-2 release seem to reflect overlapping, but nevertheless distinctive features in leukemia-associated neoangiogenesis.","['Koenecke, Christian', 'Kumpers, Philipp', 'Lukasz, Alexander', 'Dammann, Elke', 'Verhagen, Willem', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Buchholz, Stefanie', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Koenecke C', 'Kumpers P', 'Lukasz A', 'Dammann E', 'Verhagen W', 'Gohring G', 'Buchholz S', 'Krauter J', 'Eder M', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem-Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. ganser.arnold@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blast Crisis/*blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*enzymology/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, TIE-2/*blood', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/physiology']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0869-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 May;89(5):459-67. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0869-5.,10.1007/s00277-009-0869-5 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of the metabolism on therapeutic response and pharmacokinetics is still unclear. We designed this study to investigate the role of the CYP3A activity in the response to imatinib therapy. METHODS: Fourteen CML patients were phenotyped for in vivo CYP3A activity using quinine as a probe drug. The plasma concentration ratio of quinine and its CYP3A metabolite was used for assessing CYP3A activity. The patients were divided into complete molecular responders with undetectable levels of BCR-ABL transcripts after 12 months of therapy and into partial molecular responders who had failed to achieve a complete molecular response. RESULTS: Patients that achieved complete molecular response showed significantly (Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.013) higher in vivo CYP3A activity (median quinine metabolic ratio = 10.1) than patients achieving partial molecular response (median = 15.9).

Because of its immunosuppressive effects, fludarabine has been added to reduced intensity conditioning regimens. The oral formulation of fludarabine has become widely available. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that an oral dose of 40 mg/m(2)/d would provide systemic drug exposure similar to the standard intravenous (IV) dose of 25 mg/m(2)/d. The oral dose can be taken once daily without any dietary restrictions. Dose adjustments are mandatory in patients with renal impairment to avoid increased toxicity. Several noncomparative trials in previously untreated and treated patients with CLL have shown that treatment with the oral formulation demonstrates similar efficacy compared to historical control groups treated with the IV formulation. The tolerability profile of oral fludarabine seems similar to that of the IV formulation. Myelosuppression and infectious complications are the most frequently reported adverse events.

This finding prompted us to investigate potential associations between genetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma (MM) and singular miRNA expression profiles. Moreover, global gene expression profiling was also analyzed to find correlated miRNA gene expression and select miRNA target genes that show such correlation. For this purpose, we analyzed the expression level of 365 miRNAs and the gene expression profiling in 60 newly diagnosed MM patients, selected to represent the most relevant recurrent genetic abnormalities. Supervised analysis showed significantly deregulated miRNAs in the different cytogenetic subtypes as compared with normal PC. It is interesting to note that miR-1 and miR-133a clustered on the same chromosomal loci, were specifically overexpressed in the cases with t(14;16). The analysis of the relationship between miRNA expression and their respective target genes showed a conserved inverse correlation between several miRNAs deregulated in MM cells and CCND2 expression level. These results illustrate, for the first time, that miRNA expression pattern in MM is associated with genetic abnormalities, and that the correlation of the expression profile of miRNA and their putative mRNA targets is useful to find statistically significant protein-coding genes in MM pathogenesis associated with changes in specific miRNAs.","['Gutierrez, N C', 'Sarasquete, M E', 'Misiewicz-Krzeminska, I', 'Delgado, M', 'De Las Rivas, J', 'Ticona, F V', 'Ferminan, E', 'Martin-Jimenez, P', 'Chillon, C', 'Risueno, A', 'Hernandez, J M', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Gonzalez, M', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Gutierrez NC', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Misiewicz-Krzeminska I', 'Delgado M', 'De Las Rivas J', 'Ticona FV', 'Ferminan E', 'Martin-Jimenez P', 'Chillon C', 'Risueno A', 'Hernandez JM', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Gonzalez M', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BACH2 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics', 'CD47 Antigen/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclin D2/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology/*genetics']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009274 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.274 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):629-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.274.

Cell-cell contact inhibition and secretion of suppressive soluble factors have been suggested in this regard. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if adipose derived MSCs could inhibit Jurkat lymphoblastic leukemia T cell proliferation during coculture. METHODS: Adherent cells with the ability of cellular growth were isolated from normal adipose tissues. Initial characterization of growing cells by flow cytometry suggested their mesenchymal stem cell characteristics. Cells were maintained in culture and used during third to fifth culture passages. Jurkat or allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were labeled with carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and cocultured with increasing doses of MSCs or MSC culture supernatant. Proliferation of PBMCs or Jurkat cells under these conditions was assessed by flow cytometry after 2 and 3 days of coculture, respectively. RESULTS: Results showed the expression of CD105, CD166 and CD44, and the absence of CD45, CD34 and CD14 on the surface of MSC like cells. Moreover, initial differentiation studies showed the potential of cell differentiation into hepatocytes. Comparison of Jurkat cell proliferation in the presence and absence of MSCs showed no significant difference, with 70% of cells displaying signs of at least one cell division. Similarly, the highest concentration of MSC culture supernatant (50% vol/vol) had no significant effect on Jurkat cell proliferation (p>0.6). The same MSC lots significantly suppressed the allogeneic PHA activated PBMCs under similar culture conditions. CONCLUSION: Using Jurkat cells as a model of leukemia T cells, our results indicated an uncertainty about the suppressive effect of MSCs and their inhibitory metabolites on tumor or leukemia cell proliferation. Additional systematic studies with MSCs of different sources are needed to fully characterize the immunological properties of MSCs before planning clinical applications.","['Mousavi Niri, Neda', 'Jaberipour, Mansooreh', 'Razmkhah, Mahboobeh', 'Ghaderi, Abbas', 'Habibagahi, Mojtaba']","['Mousavi Niri N', 'Jaberipour M', 'Razmkhah M', 'Ghaderi A', 'Habibagahi M']","['Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical, Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (ALCAM protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endoglin', 'Fetal Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['04 [pii]', 'IJIv6i4A3 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2009 Dec;6(4):186-94. doi: IJIv6i4A3.,IJIv6i4A3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that IFN-alpha induces the growth inhibition of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). However, its intracellular signalling mechanisms remain unknown. This study found that IFN-alpha inhibited the cell proliferation of human T-ALL cell line Jurkat in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A p38 inhibitor (SB203580), but not an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor (SP600125), eliminated IFN-alpha inhibition of Jurkat cell proliferation, indicating that p38 pathway is crucial for IFN-alpha-mediated growth inhibition. SB203580 targeted two p38 isoforms, p38alpha and p38beta. The expression of p38alpha and p38beta mRNA in Jurkat cells was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The kinase activity of p38alpha and p38beta was activated by IFN-alpha in Jurkat cells. To investigate the role of p38alpha and p38beta isoforms in IFN-alpha-mediated growth inhibition, we generated stable clones that overexpressed the dominant-negative p38 isoform, p38alpha(AF) or p38beta(AF), in Jurkat cells. Overexpression of p38alpha(AF) or p38beta(AF) inhibited IFN-alpha-mediated p38 kinase activity and growth inhibition in Jurkat cells. Similarly, down-regulation of either p38alpha or p38beta by isoform-specific small interference RNAs also reduced IFN-alpha-mediated growth inhibition. These results demonstrate that IFN-alpha can regulate growth inhibition of Jurkat cells through p38alpha and p38beta.","['Lee, Wei-Hwa', 'Liu, Fu-Hwa', 'Lee, Ya-Li', 'Huang, Huei-Mei']","['Lee WH', 'Liu FH', 'Lee YL', 'Huang HM']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital; Department of Pathology, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei 116, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 11)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 11/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mvp213 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvp213 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2010 May;147(5):645-50. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvp213.

Here we have evaluated rapamycin combined with agents used frequently in the treatment of childhood malignancies. Rapamycin was tested in vitro against 23 cell lines alone or in combination with melphalan, cisplatin, vincristine, or dexamethasone (leukemic models only). In vivo, the impact of combining rapamycin with a cytotoxic agent was evaluated using two measures: 1) the therapeutic enhancement measure, and 2) a linear regression model for time-to-event to formally evaluate for sub- and supraadditivity for the combination compared to the agents used alone. Combining rapamycin with cytotoxic agents in vitro gave predominantly subadditive or additive effects, except for dexamethasone in leukemia models for which supra-additive activity was observed. In vivo testing demonstrated that therapeutic enhancement was common for rapamycin in combination with cyclophosphamide and occurred for 4 of 11 evaluable xenografts for the rapamycin and vincristine combination. The combinations of rapamycin with either cyclophosphamide or vincristine were significantly more effective than the respective standard agents used alone at their maximum tolerated doses (MTD) for most evaluable xenografts. The combination of rapamycin and cisplatin produced excessive toxicity requiring cisplatin dose reductions, and therapeutic enhancement was not observed for this combination. Addition of rapamycin to either cyclophosphamide or vincristine at their respective MTDs appears promising, as these combinations are relatively well tolerated and as many of the pediatric preclinical models evaluated demonstrated therapeutic enhancement for these combinations.","['Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Wozniak, Amy W', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Rubinstein, Larry', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Gorlick R', 'Lock RB', 'Carol H', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Kolb EA', 'Wu J', 'Wozniak AW', 'Billups CA', 'Rubinstein L', 'Smith MA']","[""Center for Children's Cancer, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio 43205, USA.

The various juxtamembrane type of KIT mutations, including V560G, are found in 60% to 70% of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors; loop mutant D816V, which exists in approximately 80% of SM patients, is completely resistant to imatinib. In the present study, we hypothesized that homoharringtonine (HHT), a protein synthesis inhibitor, would decrease the level of KIT protein by inhibiting translation, resulting in a decreased level of phospho-KIT and abrogating its constitutive downstream signaling. Imatinib-sensitive HMC-1.1 cells harboring the mutation V560G in the juxtamembrane domain of KIT, imatinib-resistant HMC-1.2 cells harboring both V560G and D816V mutations, and murine P815 cells were treated with HHT and analyzed in terms of growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction. The in vivo antitumor activity was evaluated by using the murine mast cell leukemia model. Our results indicated that HHT effectively inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in cells bearing both V560G and D816V or D814Y KIT. Additionally, HHT inhibited the KIT-dependent phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and 5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, HHT significantly prolonged the survival duration of mice with aggressive SM or mast cell leukemia by inhibiting the expansion and infiltration of imatinib-resistant mast tumor cells harboring imatinib-resistant D814Y KIT. Collectively, we show that HHT circumvents D816V KIT-elicited imatinib resistance.

These agents have been effective in slow or nonreplicative cell types. 8-Amino-adenosine is a transcription inhibitor that has proved very effective in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary indolent leukemia cells. The objective of the current work was to define mechanisms of action that lead to transcription inhibition by 8-amino-adenosine. 8-Amino-adenosine is metabolized into the active triphosphate (8-amino-ATP) in cells. This accumulation resulted in a simultaneous decrease of intracellular ATP and RNA synthesis. When the effects of established ATP synthesis inhibitors and transcription inhibitors on intracellular ATP concentrations and RNA synthesis were studied, there was a strong correlation between ATP decline and RNA synthesis. This correlation substantiated the hypothesis that the loss of ATP in 8-amino-adenosine-treated cells contributes to the decrease in transcription due to the lack of substrate needed for mRNA body and polyadenylation tail synthesis. RNA polymerase II COOH terminal domain phosphorylation declined sharply in 8-amino-adenosine-treated cells, which may have been due to the lack of an ATP phosphate donor or competitive inhibition with 8-amino-ATP at CDK7 and CDK9. Furthermore, 8-amino-ATP was incorporated into nascent RNA in a dose-dependent manner at the 3'-end resulting in transcription termination. Finally, in vitro transcription assays showed that 8-amino-ATP competes with ATP for incorporation into mRNA. Collectively, we have concluded that 8-amino-adenosine elicits effects on multiple mechanisms of transcription, providing a new class of transcription inhibitors.","['Frey, Jennifer Ann', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Frey JA', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['3868-33-5 (8-aminoadenosine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'RNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0767 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0767 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Jan;9(1):236-45. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0767.

However, one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML is nucleophosmin (NPM), and this is associated with low CD34 expression. We, therefore, investigated whether NPM-mutated AMLs have LICs restricted to the CD34(+) fraction. We transplanted sorted fractions of primary NPM-mutated AML into immunodeficient mice to establish which fractions initiate leukemia. Approximately one-half of cases had LICs exclusively within the CD34(-) fraction, whereas the CD34(+) fraction contained normal multilineage hematopoietic repopulating cells. Most of the remaining cases had LICs in both CD34(+) and CD34(-) fractions. When samples were sorted based on CD34 and CD38 expression, multiple fractions initiated leukemia in primary and secondary recipients. The data indicate that the phenotype of LICs is more heterogeneous than previously realized and can vary even within a single sample. This feature of LICs may make them particularly difficult to eradicate using therapies targeted against surface antigens.","['Taussig, David C', 'Vargaftig, Jacques', 'Miraki-Moud, Farideh', 'Griessinger, Emmanuel', 'Sharrock, Kirsty', 'Luke, Tina', 'Lillington, Debra', 'Oakervee, Heather', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Gribben, John G', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Taussig DC', 'Vargaftig J', 'Miraki-Moud F', 'Griessinger E', 'Sharrock K', 'Luke T', 'Lillington D', 'Oakervee H', 'Cavenagh J', 'Agrawal SG', 'Lister TA', 'Gribben JG', 'Bonnet D']","[""Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Queen Mary University of London, London. d.taussig@qmul.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56665-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-206565 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 11;115(10):1976-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-206565.

We used protein microarrays to serologically identify nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NuSAP1) and chromatin assembly factor 1, subunit B (p60; CHAF1b) as targets of new antibody responses that developed after allogeneic HCT. Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) validated their post-HCT recognition and enabled ELISA testing of 120 other patients with various malignancies who underwent allo-HCT. CHAF1b-specific antibodies were predominantly detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whereas NuSAP1-specific antibodies were exclusively detected in patients with AML 1 year after transplantation (P < .001). Complete genomic exon sequencing failed to identify a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for NuSAP1 and CHAF1b between the donor and recipient cells. Expression profiles and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed NuSAP1 was predominately expressed in the bone marrow CD34(+)CD90(+) hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic cell lines, and B lymphoblasts compared with other tissues or cells. Thus, NuSAP1 is recognized as an immunogenic antigen in 65% of patients with AML following allogeneic HCT and suggests a tumor antigen role.","['Wadia, Persis P', 'Coram, Marc', 'Armstrong, Randall J', 'Mindrinos, Michael', 'Butte, Atul J', 'Miklos, David B']","['Wadia PP', 'Coram M', 'Armstrong RJ', 'Mindrinos M', 'Butte AJ', 'Miklos DB']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305-5623, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NUSAP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/metabolism/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Validation Studies as Topic', 'Young Adult']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56678-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-211375 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 11;115(10):2077-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-211375.

Interestingly, the phenotype is more severe when unfractionated bone marrow cells are transplanted, yet neither progenitor cells (Lin(-)Sca-1(-)c-kit(+)), nor mature granulocytes (CD11b(+)Gr-1(+)), nor potential stem cell niche cells (CD45(-)Ter119(-)) are able to transmit the disease or alter the phenotype. The phenotype is largely independent of BCR-ABL priming before transplantation. However, prolonged BCR-ABL expression abrogates the potential of LSK cells to induce full-blown disease in secondary recipients and increases the fraction of multipotent progenitor cells at the expense of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) in the bone marrow. BCR-ABL alters the expression of genes involved in proliferation, survival, and hematopoietic development, probably contributing to the reduced LT-HSC frequency within BCR-ABL(+) LSK cells. Reversion of BCR-ABL, or treatment with imatinib, eradicates mature cells, whereas leukemic stem cells persist, giving rise to relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia on reinduction of BCR-ABL, or imatinib withdrawal.

Causes of secondary eosinophilia include parasite infections, allergic or vasculitis conditions, drugs, and lymphoma. Clonal eosinophilia is distinguished from idiopathic eosinophilia by the presence of histologic, cytogenetic, or molecular evidence of an underlying myeloid malignancy. The World Health Organization classification system for hematologic malignancies recognizes 2 distinct subcategories of clonal eosinophilia: chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and mutations involving platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/beta or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. Clonal eosinophilia might also accompany other World Health Organization-defined myeloid malignancies, including chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and systemic mastocytosis. Hypereosinophilic syndrome, a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia, is defined by the presence of a peripheral blood eosinophil count of 1.5 x 10(9)/L or greater for at least 6 months (a shorter duration is acceptable in the presence of symptoms that require eosinophil-lowering therapy), exclusion of both secondary and clonal eosinophilia, evidence of organ involvement, and absence of phenotypically abnormal and/or clonal T lymphocytes. The presence of the latter defines lymphocytic variant hyper eosinophilia, which is best classified under secondary eosinophilia. In the current review, we provide a simplified algorithm for distinguishing the various causes of clonal and idiopathic eosinophilia and discuss current therapy, including new drugs (imatinib mesylate, alemtuzumab, and mepolizumab).","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Gotlib, Jason', 'Pardanani, Animesh']","['Tefferi A', 'Gotlib J', 'Pardanani A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '90Z2UF0E52 (mepolizumab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', '*Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Causality', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eosinophilia/classification/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/classification/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications', 'Mastocytosis/complications', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(11)60389-3 [pii]', '10.4065/mcp.2009.0503 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2010 Feb;85(2):158-64. doi: 10.4065/mcp.2009.0503.

This syndrome has been associated with mutations in the SBDS gene, which encodes a conserved protein showing orthologs in Archaea and eukaryotes. The Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome pleiotropic phenotypes may be an indication of different cell type requirements for a fully functional SBDS protein. RNA-binding activity has been predicted for archaeal and yeast SBDS orthologs, with the latter also being implicated in ribosome biogenesis. However, full-length SBDS orthologs function in a species-specific manner, indicating that the knowledge obtained from model systems may be of limited use in understanding major unresolved issues regarding SBDS function, namely, the effect of mutations in human SBDS on its biochemical function and the specificity of RNA interaction. We determined the solution structure and backbone dynamics of the human SBDS protein and describe its RNA binding site using NMR spectroscopy. Similarly to the crystal structures of Archaea, the overall structure of human SBDS comprises three well-folded domains. However, significant conformational exchange was observed in NMR dynamics experiments for the flexible linker between the N-terminal domain and the central domain, and these experiments also reflect the relative motions of the domains. RNA titrations monitored by heteronuclear correlation experiments and chemical shift mapping analysis identified a classic RNA binding site at the N-terminal FYSH (fungal, Yhr087wp, Shwachman) domain that concentrates most of the mutations described for the human SBDS.","['de Oliveira, Juliana Ferreira', 'Sforca, Mauricio L', 'Blumenschein, Tharin M A', 'Goldfeder, Mauricio B', 'Guimaraes, Beatriz G', 'Oliveira, Carla Columbano', 'Zanchin, Nilson I T', 'Zeri, Ana-Carolina']","['de Oliveira JF', 'Sforca ML', 'Blumenschein TM', 'Goldfeder MB', 'Guimaraes BG', 'Oliveira CC', 'Zanchin NI', 'Zeri AC']","['Center for Structural Molecular Biology, Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory, LNLS Rua Giuseppe Maximo Scolfaro 10000, PO Box 6192, CEP 13083-970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Static Electricity', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Syndrome', 'Thermodynamics']",2010/01/08 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2009/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(09)01546-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2009.12.039 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 Mar 5;396(4):1053-69. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.12.039.

PROCEDURE: Annual rates of cancer incidence were calculated per 1,000,000 children for 3-year intervals between 1973 and 2005. Linear regression models were used to analyze the annual percent change (APC) in incidence and mortality across these distinct intervals. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, the incidence rate during the observed time period did not substantially change in urban Shanghai. Rates for the incidence of individual cancer did exhibit variations. Leukemia incidence remained relatively stable but the incidence of myeloid leukemia decreased sharply in both males (APC -8.6%) and females (APC -9.5%). The rate of NHL varied little among males with APC 2.1% and modestly increased among females with APC 9.3%. Anatomic sites that only occasionally demonstrate malignancy, bone and joints in males and endocrines in females, showed upward trends in incidence. A significant reduction in liver cancer incidence in males was observed. Examining mortality rates, all cancer mortality decreased by -6.0% annually in males and by -3.9% in females. This trend was mainly due to the reduction in mortality for leukemia, particularly the myeloid subtype, which decreased in males (APC -7.2%) and females (APC -7.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer incidence rates showed no substantial changes but mortality demonstrated a dramatic reduction during the observed time period, suggesting an improvement in both childhood cancer diagnosis and treatment.","['Bao, Ping-ping', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Gu, Kai', 'Wang, Chun-fang', 'Wu, Chun-xiao', 'Jin, Fan', 'Lu, Wei']","['Bao PP', 'Zheng Y', 'Gu K', 'Wang CF', 'Wu CX', 'Jin F', 'Lu W']","['Shanghai Cancer Registry, Department of Cancer Control and Prevention, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Prevention and Control, 1380 Zhongshan Road West, Shanghai 200336, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22383 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 1;54(7):1009-13. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22383.,10.1002/pbc.22383 [doi],,,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 1;54(7):868-9.

METHODS: A direct isothermal mRNA amplification method was developed for detection of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) mRNA transcriptional activity in the peripheral blood of 135 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and 98 hematologically healthy control subjects. RESULTS: EBV LMP1 mRNA transcripts were found in 19 of 135 (14%) of the CLL cases, but only 1% of the healthy controls (P < .0001). In contrast, 23 solid tumor patients tested negative for EBV LMP1 transcripts. In a later cohort of patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 4 of 7 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma had EBV LMP1 detected. In a preliminary analysis, outcome data were available for 88 of the 135 patients with CLL. EBV LMP1 mRNA positivity was associated with a significantly increased degree of histologically demonstrated bone marrow involvement by CLL (P = .003, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS: EBV LMP1 mRNA transcriptional activity was observed in a significant proportion of CLL patients. Transcription of the EBV LMP1, a late gene with known transforming potential in vitro, suggests that EBV activation plays a role in CLL disease progression. Thus, EBV LMP1 expression in CLL patients may be a factor involved in the genesis of refractory disease.","['Tarrand, Jeffrey J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Tsimberidou, Apostolia M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'LaSala, Rocco P', 'Han, Xiang-Yang', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Tarrand JJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Tsimberidou AM', ""O'Brien S"", 'LaSala RP', 'Han XY', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.

Little is known about the impact of tobacco use on colon cancer recurrence among colon cancer survivors. METHODS: The authors prospectively collected lifetime smoking history from stage III colon cancer patients enrolled in a phase 3 trial via self-report questionnaires during and 6 months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Smoking status was defined as never, current, or past. Lifetime pack-years were defined as number of lifetime packs of cigarettes. Patients were followed for recurrence or death. RESULTS: Data on smoking history were captured on 1045 patients with stage III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy (46% never smokers; 44% past; 10% current). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival (DFS) was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.41), 1.17 (95% CI 0.89-1.55), and 1.22 (95% CI 0.92-1.61) for lifetime pack-years 0-10, 10-20, and 20+, respectively, compared with never smoking (P = .16). In a preplanned exploratory analysis of smoking intensity early in life, the adjusted HR for 12+ pack-years before age 30 years for DFS was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.02-1.84) compared with never smoking (P = .04). The adjusted HR for DFS was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.92-1.50) for past smokers and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.73-1.64) for current smokers, compared with never smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Total tobacco usage early in life may be an important, independent prognostic factor of cancer recurrences and mortality in patients with stage III colon cancer.","['McCleary, Nadine Jackson', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Hollis, Donna', 'Saltz, Leonard B', 'Schaefer, Paul', 'Whittom, Renaud', 'Hantel, Alexander', 'Benson, Al', 'Goldberg, Richard', 'Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A']","['McCleary NJ', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Hollis D', 'Saltz LB', 'Schaefer P', 'Whittom R', 'Hantel A', 'Benson A', 'Goldberg R', 'Meyerhardt JA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02113, USA. njackson2@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/epidemiology', 'Smoking Cessation/statistics & numerical data']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24866 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Feb 15;116(4):957-66. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24866.,10.1002/cncr.24866 [doi],,,,,"['R01 CA118553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025741/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118553-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127003-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35415/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2884300,,,['NIHMS159607'],['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00003835'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from the population-based Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry were used to calculate incidence rates during the most recent 10-year period (1997-2006) and trends in incidence between 1983 and 2006 for the 12 major diagnostic groups of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. RESULTS: In the period 1997-2006, there were 6184 childhood cancer (at 0-14 years) cases in Australia (157 cases per million children). The commonest cancers were leukaemia (34%), that of the central nervous system (23%) and lymphomas (10%), with incidence the highest at 0-4 years (223 cases per million). Trend analyses showed that incidence among boys for all cancers combined increased by 1.6% per year from 1983 to 1994 but have remained stable since. Incidence rates for girls consistently increased by 0.9% per year. Since 1983, there have been significant increases among boys and girls for leukaemia, and hepatic and germ-cell tumours, whereas for boys, incidence of neuroblastomas and malignant epithelial tumours has recently decreased. For all cancers and for both sexes combined, there was a consistent increase (+0.7% per year, 1983-2006) at age 0-4 years, a slight non-significant increase at 5-9 years, and at 10-14 years, an initial increase (2.7% per year, 1983-1996) followed by a slight non-significant decrease. CONCLUSION: Although there is some evidence of a recent plateau in cancer incidence rates in Australia for boys and older children, interpretation is difficult without a better understanding of what underlies the changes reported.","['Baade, P D', 'Youlden, D R', 'Valery, P C', 'Hassall, T', 'Ward, L', 'Green, A C', 'Aitken, J F']","['Baade PD', 'Youlden DR', 'Valery PC', 'Hassall T', 'Ward L', 'Green AC', 'Aitken JF']","['Viertel Centre for Research in Cancer Control, Cancer Council Queensland, 553 Gregory Terrace, Fortitude Valley, Spring Hill, QLD 4006, Australia. peterbaade@cancerqld.org.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['6605503 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605503 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Feb 2;102(3):620-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605503.

The CD10-negative immunophenotype of infant ALL is a hallmark and provides a predictable signature of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangement. Although CD10 negativity reflects an earlier stage of B-cell development, complete IgH gene rearrangements (VDJH), found in almost half of the patients, show more mature IgH status. Discordance between immunophenotype and genotype of infant ALL suggests an aberrant process in immunophenotypic steps of differentiation or a secondary down-regulation of CD10 expression. In this study, CD10-negative infant ALL with MLL/AF4, CD10-positive infant ALL with germline MLL, CD10-positive pre-B ALL cell line, infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML; M5) with MLL/AF9 and pediatric AML (M2) with AML1/ETO were analyzed for VDJH status and methylation of CD10 gene promoters. Three of the 4 infant ALL samples showed complete rearrangements of the VDJH gene with productive joints. Bisulfite sequencing of CD10 type 1 and 2 promoters showed that more than 84% of the cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides identified were methylated in all 3 CD10-negative infant ALL samples with MLL/AF4. The CpG dinucleotides distributed in the clusters of putative Sp1-binding sites and functionally active regulatory regions of the promoters were fully methylated. In contrast, none of the CpG dinucleotides were methylated in the CD10-positive ALL samples. Structural evidence of dense methylation in the CD10 gene promoter suggested that methylated transcription factor binding sites contribute to CD10 silencing as an epigenetic mechanism.","['Ikawa, Yasuhiro', 'Sugimoto, Naotoshi', 'Koizumi, Shoichi', 'Yachie, Akihiro', 'Saikawa, Yutaka']","['Ikawa Y', 'Sugimoto N', 'Koizumi S', 'Yachie A', 'Saikawa Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neprilysin/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181c29c3c [doi]', '00043426-201001000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Jan;32(1):4-10. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181c29c3c.,10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181c29c3c [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial measurements (6/patient) of the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin and the proinflammatory adipocytokines leptin and resistin were performed at diagnosis and in nearly the entire period of therapy (up to 21 months), in 9 patients with ALL aged 2 to 7 years (median 4.3 y). Body mass index and leukemic burden were estimated at the same time points and correlated with adipocytokine levels. Nine healthy children matched for age, sex, and body mass index were used as controls. RESULTS: At diagnosis, mean adiponectin levels were low (P<0.001) and mean leptin and resistin levels were high, compared with controls (P<0.001). During maintenance phase, adiponectin increased significantly (P=0.024), whereas leptin and resistin decreased (P=0.018 and P=0.020, respectively), compared with baseline values. However, adiponectin, despite its progressive increase, remained at lower levels toward the end of the maintenance phase, compared with controls, (P<0.001). Delta (final-baseline) mean adiponectin was negatively correlated with leukemic burden (P=0.019), whereas delta mean leptin and resistin were positively correlated with it (P=0.011 and P=0.031, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low-plasma adiponectin and high leptin and resistin level are present at the ALL diagnosis.

Reflections on six cases.,110-6,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, chronic, B-cell, lymphoproliferative disorder. Treatment has been revolutionized by the advent of interferon (IFN)-alpha and purine analogs (PA). First-line therapy with PA yields complete response rates of 75-100%, with many long-lasting remissions. In the event of profound neutropenia and/or infectious complications, a short sequence of IFN-alpha may precede PA treatment. Because of the excellent results achieved with PA therapy, the potential role of rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is highly effective against most B-cell lymphomas) in HCL has yet to be elucidated. Six HCL cases treated with rituximab are reported herein with a view to elucidating the potential role of the drug in HCL. The indications essentially consist of relapsing or refractory disease, avoiding the cumulative toxicity of PA, consolidation therapy in order to eradicate minimal residual disease, and first-line therapy for patients with contraindications to PA and IFN-alpha.","['Malfuson, J V', 'Fagot, T', 'Konopacki, J', 'Souleau, B', 'Cremades, S', 'de Revel, T']","['Malfuson JV', 'Fagot T', 'Konopacki J', 'Souleau B', 'Cremades S', 'de Revel T']","[""Service d'hematologie, HIA Percy, BP 406 , 101 Av Henri Barbusse, FR-2141 Clamart, France. jvmalf @ free.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2009/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000270903 [pii]', '10.1159/000270903 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2010;123(2):110-6. doi: 10.1159/000270903.

METHODS: The acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 in cells from patients with untreated acute leukemia was determined by Western blot. Deficient histone acetylation was analyzed in relation to the disease state. Bone marrow cells from 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were cultured in phenylhexyl isothiocyanate (PHI) to evaluate correction of the deficiency. RESULTS: Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was virtually undetectable or significantly lower in acute leukemia. This deficiency was consistent among all the patients examined. Histone acetylation was up-regulated in the presence of PHI, revealing an excess of deacetylation activity in AML. PHI treatment induced apoptosis, indicating HDAC inhibition was able to correct the deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Deficient histone acetylation may represent an aberration at the epigenetic level in acute leukemia. PHI might represent a target for correcting deficient acetylation, and potential epigenetic regulators for preventing the progression of leukemia.","['Xiao, Liyun', 'Huang, Yiqun', 'Zhen, Ruiji', 'Chiao, J W', 'Liu, Delong', 'Ma, Xudong']","['Xiao L', 'Huang Y', 'Zhen R', 'Chiao JW', 'Liu D', 'Ma X']","['Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '133920-06-6 (6-phenylhexyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2009/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000264628 [pii]', '10.1159/000264628 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2010;123(2):71-6. doi: 10.1159/000264628.

During congestive heart failure (CHF), sympathetic neural tone is upregulated, but there is a paradoxical reduction in norepinephrine synthesis and reuptake in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Here we examined whether cholinergic transdifferentiation can occur in the cardiac SNS in rodent models of CHF and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism(s) using genetically modified mice. We used Dahl salt-sensitive rats to model CHF and found that, upon CHF induction, the cardiac SNS clearly acquired cholinergic characteristics. Of the various cholinergic differentiation factors, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 were strongly upregulated in the ventricles of rats with CHF. Further, LIF and cardiotrophin-1 secreted from cultured failing rat cardiomyocytes induced cholinergic transdifferentiation in cultured sympathetic neurons, and this process was reversed by siRNAs targeting Lif and cardiotrophin-1. Consistent with the data in rats, heart-specific overexpression of LIF in mice caused cholinergic transdifferentiation in the cardiac SNS. Further, SNS-specific targeting of the gene encoding the gp130 subunit of the receptor for LIF and cardiotrophin-1 in mice prevented CHF-induced cholinergic transdifferentiation. Cholinergic transdifferentiation was also observed in the cardiac SNS of autopsied patients with CHF. Thus, CHF causes target-dependent cholinergic transdifferentiation of the cardiac SNS via gp130-signaling cytokines secreted from the failing myocardium.","['Kanazawa, Hideaki', 'Ieda, Masaki', 'Kimura, Kensuke', 'Arai, Takahide', 'Kawaguchi-Manabe, Haruko', 'Matsuhashi, Tomohiro', 'Endo, Jin', 'Sano, Motoaki', 'Kawakami, Takashi', 'Kimura, Tokuhiro', 'Monkawa, Toshiaki', 'Hayashi, Matsuhiko', 'Iwanami, Akio', 'Okano, Hideyuki', 'Okada, Yasunori', 'Ishibashi-Ueda, Hatsue', 'Ogawa, Satoshi', 'Fukuda, Keiichi']","['Kanazawa H', 'Ieda M', 'Kimura K', 'Arai T', 'Kawaguchi-Manabe H', 'Matsuhashi T', 'Endo J', 'Sano M', 'Kawakami T', 'Kimura T', 'Monkawa T', 'Hayashi M', 'Iwanami A', 'Okano H', 'Okada Y', 'Ishibashi-Ueda H', 'Ogawa S', 'Fukuda K']","['Department of Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (biotinylated dextran amine)', '0 (choline transporter)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dextrans/pharmacology', 'Heart Conduction System/*physiopathology', 'Heart Failure/*physiopathology', 'Heart Ventricles/innervation/physiopathology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism/physiology', 'Nerve Fibers/physiology', 'Neurons/physiology', 'Norepinephrine/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Stellate Ganglion/drug effects/physiology/physiopathology', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2009/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['39778 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI39778 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Feb;120(2):408-21. doi: 10.1172/JCI39778.

Any modification of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by disease or drug treatment, however, elicits a parallel change in osteoblast-mediated bone formation because the processes are tightly coupled. Anabolic approaches now focus on uncoupling osteoblast action from osteoclast formation, for example, by inhibiting sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone formation that does not influence osteoclast differentiation. Here, we report that oncostatin M (OSM) is produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes in mouse bone and that it has distinct effects when acting through 2 different receptors, OSM receptor (OSMR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Specifically, mouse OSM (mOSM) inhibited sclerostin production in a stromal cell line and in primary murine osteoblast cultures by acting through LIFR. In contrast, when acting through OSMR, mOSM stimulated RANKL production and osteoclast formation. A key role for OSMR in bone turnover was confirmed by the osteopetrotic phenotype of mice lacking OSMR. Furthermore, in contrast to the accepted model, in which mOSM acts only through OSMR, mOSM inhibited sclerostin expression in Osmr-/- osteoblasts and enhanced bone formation in vivo. These data reveal what we believe to be a novel pathway by which bone formation can be stimulated independently of bone resorption and provide new insights into OSMR and LIFR signaling that are relevant to other medical conditions, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.","['Walker, Emma C', 'McGregor, Narelle E', 'Poulton, Ingrid J', 'Solano, Melissa', 'Pompolo, Sueli', 'Fernandes, Tania J', 'Constable, Matthew J', 'Nicholson, Geoff C', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Gillespie, Matthew T', 'Martin, T John', 'Sims, Natalie A']","['Walker EC', 'McGregor NE', 'Poulton IJ', 'Solano M', 'Pompolo S', 'Fernandes TJ', 'Constable MJ', 'Nicholson GC', 'Zhang JG', 'Nicola NA', 'Gillespie MT', 'Martin TJ', 'Sims NA']","[""St. Vincent's Institute, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Sost protein, mouse)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Bone Development/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics', 'Bone Resorption/*pathology', 'Bone and Bones/anatomy & histology', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/deficiency/genetics/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Organ Size', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Osteocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*physiology', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2009/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['40568 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI40568 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Feb;120(2):582-92. doi: 10.1172/JCI40568.

Here, we report that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) activated the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins PMAIP1/Noxa and BBC3/Puma and induced accumulation of anti-apoptotic MCL1 as well as repression of anti-apoptotic BCL2L1/Bcl-xL. Retroviral expression of Bcl-xL, but not of MCL1, prevented apoptosis by bortezomib. Gene knockdown of Noxa by shRNA technology significantly reduced apoptosis, whereas Puma knockdown did not affect cell death kinetics. Immunoprecipitation revealed that endogenous Noxa associated with both, Bcl-xL and MCL1, suggesting that in neuronal cells Noxa can neutralize Bcl-xL, explaining the pronounced protective effect of Bcl-xL. Tetracycline-regulated Noxa expression did not trigger cell death per se but sensitized to bortezomib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. This implies that the induction of Noxa is necessary but not sufficient for bortezomib-induced apoptosis. We conclude that MCL1 steady-state expression levels do not affect sensitivity to proteasome-inhibitor treatment in neuronal tumor cells, and that both the repression of Bcl-xL and the activation of Noxa are necessary for bortezomib-induced cell death.","['Hagenbuchner, Judith', 'Ausserlechner, Michael J', 'Porto, Verena', 'David, Reinhard', 'Meister, Bernhard', 'Bodner, Martin', 'Villunger, Andreas', 'Geiger, Kathrin', 'Obexer, Petra']","['Hagenbuchner J', 'Ausserlechner MJ', 'Porto V', 'David R', 'Meister B', 'Bodner M', 'Villunger A', 'Geiger K', 'Obexer P']","['Department of Pediatrics IV, Biocenter, Medical University Innsbruck, Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transgenes', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)58679-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.038331 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Mar 5;285(10):6904-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.038331.

A 31-year-old male with chronic granulomatous disease developed pulmonary aspergillosis despite itraconazole prophylaxis. A. fumigatus was cultured from the lung and was found to be azole-resistant. The patient was successfully treated with caspofungin. The second patient was a 13-year-old boy with acute lymphoid leukaemia. He developed pulmonary aspergillosis that failed to respond to voriconazole therapy. The infection spread to the brain and an azole-resistant isolate was cultured from a lung biopsy. Despite a switch to liposomal amphotericin B in combination with caspofungin, the infection progressed and the patient died. Azole-resistance has emerged in A. fumigatus and may develop through the treatment of patients. However, there is evidence that in the Netherlands, resistance might be emerging through fungal exposure to azole fungicides. Azole resistance further complicates the management of invasive aspergillosis and should be considered as cause for treatment failure.","['van der Linden, Jan W', 'Warris, Adilia', 'van der Meer, Jos W', 'Bresters, Dorine', 'Melchers, Willem J', 'Verweij, Paul E']","['van der Linden JW', 'Warris A', 'van der Meer JW', 'Bresters D', 'Melchers WJ', 'Verweij PE']","['Universitair Medisch Centrum St. Radboud, Afd.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and type I collagen telopeptide, but not parathyroid hormone, calcitriol or parathyroid hormone-related peptide at diagnosis, suggesting local osteoclastic hypercalcemia in this case. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we found predominant expression of mRNA for MIP-1alpha in addition to those for receptor-activator of nuclear-factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in lymphoma cells obtained from the patient. Furthermore, recombinant MIP-1alpha significantly stimulated (3)H-thymidine uptake by isolated MCL cells in vitro. Treatment with intravenous fluids, bisphosphonate, and methylprednisolone followed by combination chemotherapy promptly corrects the hypercalcemia and successfully induced complete remission, which was accompanied by a decrease of these cytokines in the serum, including MIP-1alpha. In the present case, MIP-1alpha, an osteoclast-activating factor produced by mantle lymphoma cells, may contribute to the development of hypercalcemia. It likely acts through RANKL expression in tumor cells and/or stroma cells, as indicated in multiple myeloma (MM) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Furthermore, MIP-1alpha is also involved in the development of an aggressive phenotype on MCL by stimulating proliferation of these lymphoma cells. In summary, the present study demonstrated that MIP-1alpha is an important factor in the development of both hypercalcemia and an aggressive phenotype in some types of B-cell lymphoma.","['Hattori, Norimichi', 'Nakamaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Ariizumi, Hirotsugu', 'Homma, Mayumi', 'Yamochi-Onizuka, Toshiko', 'Ota, Hidekazu', 'Tomoyasu, Shigeru']","['Hattori N', 'Nakamaki T', 'Ariizumi H', 'Homma M', 'Yamochi-Onizuka T', 'Ota H', 'Tomoyasu S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. nhattor@med.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Chemokine CCL3)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chemokine CCL3/*blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/complications/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/complications/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1405 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01405.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 May;84(5):448-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01405.x.

Tie-2 can be expressed both by primary human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells and endothelial cells, and Tie-2-blocking antibodies are now being evaluated in clinical trials for cancer treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of Tie-2-blocking antibodies, exogenous Ang-2 and pharmacological agents on AML cell proliferation and the release of angioregulatory mediators. RESULTS: Tie-2-blocking antibodies had a growth inhibitory effect on human AML cells co-cultured with microvascular endothelial cells, but this inhibition was not observed when leukaemic cells were co-cultured with fibroblasts or osteoblasts. AML cell viability in co-cultures was not altered by anti-Tie-2. Furthermore, anti-Tie-2 decreased hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels and increased CXCL8 levels in co-cultures, whereas the levels of endocan (a proteoglycan released by endothelial cells) were not altered. The only significant effects of exogenous Ang-2 were decreased levels of HGF and endocan. Constitutive AML cell release of agonistic Ang-1 was decreased by the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib and the specific IkappaB-kinase/NFkappaB inhibitor BMS-345541. CONCLUSION: We conclude that various strategies for inhibition of Tie-2-mediated signalling should be considered in AML therapy, possibly in combination with other antiangiogenic strategies.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne', 'Lassalle, Philippe', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Lassalle P', 'Kittang AO', 'Ersvaer E', 'Bruserud O']","['University of Bergen, Institute of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"[""0 (4(2'-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline)"", '0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (ESM1 protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiopoietin-1/*metabolism', 'Angiopoietin-2/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacology', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/*drug effects', 'Receptor, TIE-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543780903485659 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010 Feb;19(2):169-83. doi: 10.1517/13543780903485659.,10.1517/13543780903485659 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular responses induced by arsenite treatment have been investigated for years; however, the precise mechanisms underlying its cytotoxicity and therapeutic activity remain unclear. Here we report the use of mass spectrometry together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the comparative study of protein expression in HL-60 cells that were untreated or treated with a clinically relevant concentration of arsenite. Our results revealed that, among the 1067 proteins quantified in both forward and reverse SILAC measurements, 56 had significantly altered levels of expression induced by arsenite treatment. These included the up-regulation of core histones, neutrophil elastase, alpha-mannosidase as well as the down-regulation of fatty acid synthase and protein phosphatase 1 alpha. We further demonstrated that the arsenite-induced growth inhibition of HL-60 cells could be rescued by treatment with palmitate, the final product of fatty acid synthase, supporting that arsenite exerts its cytotoxic effect, in part, via suppressing the expression of fatty acid synthase and inhibiting the endogenous production of fatty acid. The results from the present study offered important new knowledge for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of arsenite.","['Xiong, Lei', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Xiong L', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521-0403, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthases)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fatty Acid Synthases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', '*Proteomics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2010/01/07 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2010/01/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr9011359 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2010 Feb 5;9(2):1129-37. doi: 10.1021/pr9011359.,10.1021/pr9011359 [doi],,,,,"['R01 CA116522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116522-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 116522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2819029,,,['NIHMS169080'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric patients with neoplastic diseases are more likely to develop nosocomial infections (NIs). NIs may prolong their hospital stay, and increase morbidity and mortality. Objectives. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the incidence of NIs, (2) sites of NIs, (3) causal organisms, and (4) outcomes of NIs among pediatric patients with neoplastic diseases. Methods. This study was a prospective cohort study of pediatric patients with neoplastic diseases who were admitted to the Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand. Results. A total of 707 pediatric patients with neoplastic diseases were admitted. Forty-six episodes of NIs in 30 patients were reported (6.5 NIs/100 admission episodes and 7 NIs/1000 days of hospitalization). Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the highest number of NIs (41.3%). The most common causal organisms were gram-negative bacteria (47.1%). Patients who had undergone invasive procedures were more likely to develop NIs than those who had not (P < .05). The mortality rate of patients with NIs was 19.6%. Conclusion. Pediatric patients with neoplastic diseases are more likely to develop NIs after having undergone invasive procedures. Pediatricians should be aware of this and strictly follow infection control guidelines in order to reduce morbidity and mortality rates related to NIs.","['Oberdorfer, Peninnah', 'Pongwilairat, Natthida', 'Washington, Charles H']","['Oberdorfer P', 'Pongwilairat N', 'Washington CH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Int J Pediatr,International journal of pediatrics,101517077,,,,2010/01/06 06:00,2010/01/06 06:01,['2010/01/06 06:00'],"['2009/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/721320 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Pediatr. 2009;2009:721320. doi: 10.1155/2009/721320.

The cumulative absorbed doses to the fetus, as conventionally assessed, varied from 0.02 mSv in the UK through 0.06 mSv in Germany, 0.2 mSv in Greece and 2 mSv in Belarus, where it was highest. Nevertheless, the effect was real and given the specificity of the cohort raised questions about the safety of applying the current radiation risk model of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to these internal exposures, a matter which was discussed in 2000 by Busby and Cato and also in the reports of the UK Committee examining Radiation Risk from Internal Emitters. Data on infant leukemia in the United Kingdom, chosen on the basis of the cohorts defined by the study of Greece were supplied by the UK Childhood Cancer Research Group. This has enabled a study of leukemia in the combined infant population of 15,466,845 born in the UK, Greece, and Germany between 1980 and 1990. Results show a statistically significant excess risk RR = 1.43 (95% CI 1.13 < RR < 1.80 (2-tailed); p = 0.0025) in those born during the defined peak exposure period of 01/07/86 to 31/12/87 compared with those born between 01/01/80 and 31/12/85 and 01/01/88 and 31/12/90. The excess risks in individual countries do not increase monotonically with the conventionally calculated doses, the relation being biphasic, increasing sharply at low doses and falling at high doses. This result is discussed in relation to fetal/cell death at higher doses and also to induction of DNA repair. Since the cohort is chosen specifically on the basis of exposure to internal radionuclides, the result can be expressed as evidence for a significant error in the conventional modeling for such internal fetal exposures.","['Busby, Christopher C']",['Busby CC'],"['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine, UK. christo@greenaudit.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/adverse effects', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fetus/*radiation effects', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Republic of Belarus/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Russia', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",2010/01/06 06:00,2011/02/02 06:00,['2010/01/06 06:00'],"['2008/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph6123105 [doi]', 'ijerph6123105 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2009 Dec;6(12):3105-14. doi: 10.3390/ijerph6123105.

Here, we discuss the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of the oncogenic potential of eIF4E. Studies in human leukemia specimens, and later in a mouse model of prostate cancer, strongly suggest that cells with elevated eIF4E develop an oncogene dependency to it, making them more sensitive to targeting eIF4E than normal cells. We describe several strategies that have been suggested for eIF4E targeting in the clinic: the use of a small molecule antagonist of eIF4E (ribavirin), siRNA or antisense oligonucleotide strategies, suicide gene therapy, and the use of a tissue-targeting 4EBP fusion peptide. The first clinical trial targeting eIF4E indicates that ribavirin effectively targets eIF4E in poor prognosis leukemia patients and more importantly leads to striking clinical responses including complete and partial remissions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these findings to HNSCC.","['Culjkovic, Biljana', 'Borden, Katherine L']","['Culjkovic B', 'Borden KL']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H4M 1J6.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2010/01/06 06:00,2010/01/06 06:01,['2010/01/06 06:00'],"['2009/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/981679 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2009;2009:981679. doi: 10.1155/2009/981679.

K562/granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a GM-CSF producing vaccine derived from a CML cell line that expresses several CML-associated antigens. A pilot study was developed to determine if K562/GM-CSF immunotherapy could improve clinical responses to imatinib mesylate (IM) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with chronic phase CML who achieved at least a major cytogeneic response but remained with persistent, measurable disease despite one or more years on imatinib mesylate were eligible. Each was given a series of four vaccines administered in three-week intervals, with or without topical imiquimod, while remaining on a stable dose of imatinib mesylate. CML disease burden was measured serially before and after vaccination. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were vaccinated, with a median duration of previous imatinib mesylate therapy of 37 (13-53) months. Mean PCR measurements of BCR-ABL for the group declined significantly following the vaccines (P = 0.03). Thirteen patients had a progressive decline in disease burden, 8 of whom had increasing disease burden before vaccination. Twelve patients achieved their lowest tumor burden measurements to date following vaccine, including seven subjects who became PCR-undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: K562/GM-CSF vaccine appears to improve molecular responses in patients on imatinib mesylate, including achieving complete molecular remissions, despite long durations of previous imatinib mesylate therapy.","['Smith, B Douglas', 'Kasamon, Yvette L', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Gocke, Christopher', 'Murphy, Kathleen', 'Miller, Carole B', 'Garrett-Mayer, Elizabeth', 'Tsai, Hua-Ling', 'Qin, Lu', 'Chia, Christina', 'Biedrzycki, Barbara', 'Harding, Thomas C', 'Tu, Guang Haun', 'Jones, Richard', 'Hege, Kristen', 'Levitsky, Hyam I']","['Smith BD', 'Kasamon YL', 'Kowalski J', 'Gocke C', 'Murphy K', 'Miller CB', 'Garrett-Mayer E', 'Tsai HL', 'Qin L', 'Chia C', 'Biedrzycki B', 'Harding TC', 'Tu GH', 'Jones R', 'Hege K', 'Levitsky HI']","['Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins and St Agnes Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA. bdsmith@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoquinolines/administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Imiquimod', 'Immunotherapy', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Burden']",2010/01/06 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2010/01/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['16/1/338 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2046 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jan 1;16(1):338-47. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2046.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2046 [doi],,,,,"['R21 CA108174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA108174-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA108174-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2804932,,,['NIHMS159836'],,,,,,,,,,,,

High doses of cytarabine have been reported as being too toxic for patients older than age 50 years, but few studies have evaluated intensified doses of anthracyclines. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized Acute Leukemia French Association 9801 (ALFA-9801) study, high doses of daunorubicin (DNR; 80 mg/m(2)/d x 3 days) or idarubicin (IDA4; 12 mg/m(2)/d x 4 days) were compared with standard doses of idarubicin (IDA3; 12 mg/m(2)/d x 3 days) for remission induction in patients age 50 to 70 years, with an event-free survival (EFS) end point. After two consolidation courses based on intermediate doses of cytarabine, patients in continuous remission were randomly assigned to receive or not receive maintenance therapy with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2; 5 x 10(6) U/m(2) x 5 days each month) for a total duration of 12 months. A total of 468 patients entered the study (median age, 60 years). Results Overall complete remission rate was 77% with significant differences among the three randomization arms (83%, 78%, and 70% in the IDA3, IDA4, and DNR arms, respectively; P = .04). However, no significant differences were observed in relapse incidence, EFS, or overall survival among the three arms. In the 161 patients randomly assigned for maintenance therapy, no difference in outcome was observed between the rIL-2 and the no further treatment arms. CONCLUSION Neither intensification of anthracycline doses nor maintenance with rIL-2 showed a significant impact on AML course, at least as scheduled in this trial.","['Pautas, Cecile', 'Merabet, Fatiha', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Gardin, Claude', 'Corm, Selim', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Turlure, Pascal', 'Contentin, Nathalie', 'de Revel, Thierry', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Terre, Christine', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Castaigne, Sylvie']","['Pautas C', 'Merabet F', 'Thomas X', 'Raffoux E', 'Gardin C', 'Corm S', 'Bourhis JH', 'Reman O', 'Turlure P', 'Contentin N', 'de Revel T', 'Rousselot P', 'Preudhomme C', 'Bordessoule D', 'Fenaux P', 'Terre C', 'Michallet M', 'Dombret H', 'Chevret S', 'Castaigne S']","['Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Hopital Andre Mignot, Service Hematologie et Oncologie, 177 rue de Versailles, 78150 Le Chesnay, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'M89N0Q7EQR (aldesleukin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/01/06 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2010/01/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.23.2652 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.23.2652 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 10;28(5):808-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.23.2652.

METHODS: In vitro pharmacokinetic properties, including specific and nonspecific binding of (124)I-SKI230 to its Abl kinase target and interaction with other PKIs, were assessed in cell-free medium and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells overexpressing BCR-Abl (K562), in comparison with BT-474 cells that are low in Abl expression. In a xenograft tumor model, we assessed the in vivo pharmacokinetics of (124)I-SKI230 using PET and postmortem tissue sampling. We also tested a paradigm of (124)I-SKI230 PET after treatment of the animal with a dose of Abl-specific PKI for the monitoring of the tumor response. RESULTS: In vitro studies confirmed that SKI230 binds to Abl kinase with nanomolar affinity, that selective uptake occurs in cell lines known to express Abl kinase, that RNAi knock-down supports specificity of cellular uptake due to Abl kinase, and that imatinib, an archetype Abl PKI, completely displaces SKI230. With SKI230, we obtained successful in vivo PET of Abl-expressing human tumors in a nude rat. We were also able to demonstrate evidence of substrate inhibition of in vivo radiotracer uptake in the xenograft tumor after treatment of the animal as a model of PKI treatment monitoring. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that molecular imaging using PET will be useful for the study of in vivo pharmacodynamics of Abl PKI molecular therapy in humans.","['Doubrovin, Mikhail', 'Kochetkova, Tatiana', 'Santos, Elmer', 'Veach, Darren R', 'Smith-Jones, Peter', 'Pillarsetty, Nagavarakishore', 'Balatoni, Julius', 'Bornmann, William', 'Gelovani, Juri', 'Larson, Steven M']","['Doubrovin M', 'Kochetkova T', 'Santos E', 'Veach DR', 'Smith-Jones P', 'Pillarsetty N', 'Balatoni J', 'Bornmann W', 'Gelovani J', 'Larson SM']","['Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (2-(4-iodophenylamino)pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidin-7-one)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*enzymology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Pyridones/pharmacokinetics', '*Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', '*Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics']",2010/01/06 06:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2010/01/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['51/1/121 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.109.066126 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2010 Jan;51(1):121-9. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.109.066126.,10.2967/jnumed.109.066126 [doi],,,,,"['P50 CA086438-05S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA086438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA094060-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA094060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA083084-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA083084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4432838,,,['NIHMS687506'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in the pharmacotherapy of fungal infections and a shift in the epidemiological characteristics of fungal pathogens toward fluconazole-resistant Candida species and saprophytic molds have placed a greater emphasis on selection of broader-spectrum agents for empirical therapy of IFIs in this high-risk population. Newer diagnostic modalities, such as the Aspergillus galactomannan test, the 1,3-beta-d-glucan test, and polymerase chain reaction detection of fungal DNA, may facilitate the earlier diagnosis of IFIs, but their role in detecting breakthrough infection and their usefulness as a marker to withhold antifungal therapy in high-risk leukemia patients with IFI are less obvious, especially in patients who are receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Only 2 strategies have been shown in prospective studies to improve survival from mold infection in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: (1) preemptive initiation of antifungal therapy at first sign of invasive aspergillosis on computed tomography (CT) scan and (2) antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. CT-guided treatment decisions are more complex in patients with advanced leukemia, however, because of concomitant infection or relapsing malignancy. Similarly, posaconazole is often not a viable prophylaxis or treatment option in patients with poor oral intake, gastrointestinal dysfunction, or possible drug interaction (eg, proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis in patients on high-dose glucocorticosteroids). As a result, the management of IFI in patients with leukemia demands an individualized treatment plan.","['Leventakos, Konstantinos', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Leventakos K', 'Lewis RE', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, University of Texas M.

Sera were screened in an HTLV-1 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and further analyzed in peptide-specific Western blots (WB). DNAs were analyzed by HTLV-1, -2, -3, and -4-specific PCR. Forty four percent of LGLL patients vs. 0.12 % of VBD had anti-HTLV antibodies via EIA (p < 0.001). WB and PCR revealed that four LGLL patients (7.5%) vs. one VBD patient (0.01%) were infected with HTLV-2 (p < 0.001), suggesting an HTLV-2 etiology in a minority of cases. No LGLL patient was positive for HTLV-1, -3, or -4, whereas only one EIA-positive VBD was positive for HTLV-1 and none for HTLV-3 or -4. The HTLV EIA-positive, PCR-negative LGLL patients' sera reacted to epitopes within HTLV p24 gag and gp21 env. Other then the PTLV/BLV viruses, human endogenous retroviral element HERV K10 was the only sequence homologous to these two HTLV peptides, raising the possibility of cross-reactivity. Although three LGLL patients (5.7%) vs. none of 110 VBD patients tested positive for antibodies to the homologous HERV K10 peptide (p = 0.03), the significance of the anti-HTLV seroreactivity observed in many LGLL patients remains unclear. Interestingly, out of 36 HTLV-1-positive control subjects, 3 (8%) (p = 0.014) were positive for antibodies to HERV K10; all three had myelopathy. Out of 64 HTLV-2-positive control subjects 16 (25%) (p = <0.001) were positive for HERV K10 antibodies, and 4 (6%) of these had myelopathy. Out of 22 subjects with either HTLV-1 or -2 myelopathy, 7 (31.8%) were positive for HERV K10 antibodies, and out of 72 HTLV-infected subjects without myelopathy, 12 (16.7%) were positive for anti-HERV K10 antibodies (p = 0.11).

The overarching theme of the state-of-the-art reports featured the unique suitability of zebrafish for in vivo monitoring of fundamental biologic and pathologic processes. For example, in vivo imaging was employed for the first demonstration of direct development of hematopoietic stem cells from hemogenic epithelium and for visualization of T-cell homing and interaction with thymic epithelial cells. In addition, in vivo monitoring was instrumental for developing disease models of solid tumors, leukemia, and of inflammatory conditions, and for assessing the efficacy of small molecule drugs under physiologic and pathologic conditions. The success of zebrafish small molecule screens was underscored by the identification of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as an efficient inducer of stem cell expansion that led to the initiation of the first human trial on the efficacy of PGE2 in bone marrow transplantation. Further, zebrafish models of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis have been established that are now amenable to high-throughput in vivo drug screens, a much-needed development in the fight against drug-resistant microorganisms.

Most of these neoplasms were highly similar to human diseases. Also, some non-lymphoid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and histiocytic sarcoma were found. Interestingly, composite lymphomas, including Hodgkin-like lymphomas, were also detected that had CD30(+) Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (H/RS)-like cells, representing a tumor type not previously described in mice. Analysis of microdissected H/RS-like cells revealed their origin as germinal center B cells bearing somatic hypermutations and, in some instances, crippled mutations, as described for human Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Transgene integration in an oncogene was excluded as an exclusive driving force of tumorigenesis and age-related lymphoma development suggests a multi-step process.

However, the differential diagnosis of NK lymphoproliferative disorders is difficult because of the absence of a distinct diagnostic hallmark. Therefore, to identify diagnostic markers for ANKL, we analyzed the clinical data and laboratory findings obtained for 20 patients with ANKL. METHODS: From January 2000 to July 2007, 20 patients were diagnosed with ANKL on the basis of bone marrow studies. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and laboratory findings, including the complete blood count, Epstein-Barr virus status, immunophenotype, and the cytogenetic results. RESULTS: The subjects included 6 women and 14 men (median age, 44 yr; range, 2-70 yr). Cytogenetic studies were performed in 18 patients, and karyotypic abnormalities were observed in 9 patients (50%). None of the cytogenetic abnormalities were constantly observed in all the patients. However, 6q abnormalities were observed in 4 patients (4/18, 22%). The immunophenotype of the leukemic NK-cells was cytoplasmic CD3(+), surface CD3(-), CD16/56(+), CD2(+), and CD5(-). Notably, the CD7 antigen was absent in 10 patients (50%). When the CD7 loss was combined with cytogenetic abnormalities, clonal markers could be identified in 75% of the ANKL cases. CONCLUSIONS: The CD7 antigen loss was frequently observed in our series of ANKL patients. In conjunction with the cytogenetic findings, this characteristic immunophenotypic finding can serve as a reliable marker for the timely diagnosis of ANKL. Therefore, immunophenotypic analysis of CD7 expression should be included in the diagnosis of NK cell neoplasms.","['Yoo, Eun-Hyung', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Lee, Seung-Tae', 'Kim, Won-Seog', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Yoo EH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee ST', 'Kim WS', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD7/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2010/01/05 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/01/05 06:00'],"['2010/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['200912491 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.6.491 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2009 Dec;29(6):491-6. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.6.491.,10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.6.491 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the major mechanisms by which antibodies exert anti-tumor effects. ADCC occurs through interaction between the Fc domains of IgG antibodies bound to target cells and Fcgamma receptors on the surface of effector cells. In our study, a chimeric antibody, designated M-Ab, was constructed with the V regions from mouse anti-CD20 mAb 1F5 and the C regions from human IgG1 and kappa chain. Two or three Fc domains were tandemly repeated downstream of the C-terminus of the M-Ab to give D0-Ab (Fc dimer Ab without a linker), T0-Ab (Fc trimer Ab without a linker), and T3-Ab (Fc trimer Ab with a (GGGGS)(3) linker in front of the second and third hinge regions). Here, we show that Fc tandem repeat antibodies bind to all the low-affinity Fcgamma receptors with very potent avidities and have greatly enhanced ADCC activity. T3-Ab is about 100 times more potent than the parental 1F5 chimeric antibody in terms of both Fcgamma receptor binding and exerted ADCC activity at a 50-100 times less concentration as compared with the parental antibody. Thus, Fc tandem repeat antibodies are anticipated to be candidates for anti-tumor therapeutics and useful tools to elucidate the biological roles of Fcgamma receptors.","['Nagashima, Hiroaki', 'Masuho, Yasuhiko']","['Nagashima H', 'Masuho Y']","['Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan. nagashimahra@chugai-pharm.co.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Mice', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Receptors, IgG', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences']",2010/01/05 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2010/01/05 06:00'],"['2010/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/130.49 [pii]', '10.1248/yakushi.130.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2010 Jan;130(1):49-54. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.130.49.,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case analyses with a review of the literature. PARTICIPANTS: One patient with paraneoplastic ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (POCP) and 1 patient with paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) with ocular involvement. METHODS: Critical review of clinical history, diagnostic studies, and immunopathologic results of biopsies in the 2 cases, together with a review of the literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ability to recognize paraneoplastic conjunctival cicatrization and to diagnose the conditions accurately. RESULTS: The first patient, 46 years of age, presented with conjunctival scarring and symblephara, cough, oral lesions, and chest rash. Concurrently, a diagnosis of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma was made. Conjunctival biopsy revealed a subepithelial bulla, an inflammatory infiltrate of T and B lymphocytes, and basement membrane zone deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig)-G and C3 consistent with POCP. The second patient, 54 years of age, had a recently diagnosed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, followed 1 month later with ocular irritation and bilateral extensive symblephara. Extensive oral lesions and skin involvement of the lower half of the body were seen. Skin biopsy disclosed subepidermal bullae and mostly T cells with virtually no B cells in the dermal infiltrate (the patient was being treated with rituximab). Linear subepithelial deposition of IgG and C3 and deposition within the epidermis were consistent with PNP. Further indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies with the patient's serum-derived antibodies established PNP as the definitive diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying malignancy is an important consideration in younger patients with puzzling bilateral cicatrizing conjunctivitis, and a paraneoplastic condition can be established from either a conjunctival or a skin biopsy.

However, mechanisms of this defect have not been fully elucidated. In this study, expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs (cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP and survivin), and their antagonists (Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2/Omi) was comprehensively analysed in 100 untreated CLL patients, using flow cytometry and Western blot techniques. Expression of anti-apoptotic cIAP1 and cIAP2 in leukaemic cells was significantly higher than in non-tumour lymphocytes (p=0.000001 and p=0.014, respectively), whereas the IAP-antagonist, Smac/DIABLO, was decreased in CLL (p=0.010). Higher expression of all analysed IAPs (cIAP1, p=0.002; cIAP2, p=0.026; XIAP, p=0.002; survivin, p=0.00006) and lower levels of Smac/DIABLO (p=0.006) were found in patients with progressive disease, compared to those with stable CLL. High baseline expression of cIAP1 and survivin correlated with worse response to treatment. Co-expression of these proteins was associated with shorter overall survival of CLL patients (p=0.005). In conclusion, CLL cells show the apoptosis-resistant profile of IAPs/IAP-antagonist expression. Upregulation of IAPs is associated with a progressive course of the disease. Co-expression of cIAP1 and survivin seems to be an unfavourable prognostic factor in CLL patients. Further studies with longer follow up are warranted to confirm and expand these findings.","['Grzybowska-Izydorczyk, Olga', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Grzybowska-Izydorczyk O', 'Cebula B', 'Robak T', 'Smolewski P']","['Department of Experimental Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Ciolkowskiego 2, 93-510 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.108 (HTRA2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.108 (High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 2', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*blood', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/blood', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/01/05 06:00,2010/04/10 06:00,['2010/01/05 06:00'],"['2009/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00877-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Mar;46(4):800-10. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.11.023.

Etoposide has variable oral bioavailability ranging from 24-74% and has terminal half life of 1.5 hours by intravenous route. The conventional parenteral therapy causes inconvenience and pain to the patients as it has to be given through a continuous IV infusion over 24-34 h. The present investigation was aimed at developing etoposide loaded biodegradable nanoparticles which would be a sustained release formulation and replace the conventional therapy of continuous intravenous administration. Nanoparticles were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method using high pressure homogenization. The process parameters like homogenization cycles (four) and homogenization pressure (10000 psi) were first optimized using a 3(2) factorial design based on response Y1(mean particle size of 98+/-1nm). Then a 32 factorial design was carried out to study the effect of two independent variables, ratio of drug and polymer (X1) and surfactant concentration (X2) on the two responses to obtain their optimized values, percentage entrapment efficiency (Y2, 83.12+/-8.3%) and mean particle size (Y3, 105+/-5.4 nm) for Etoposide loaded PLGA Nanoparticles. Contour plots and response surface plots showed visual representation of relationship between the experimental responses and the set of input variables. The adequacy of the regression model was verified by a check point analysis. The zeta potential values ranged between -23.0 to -34.2 mV, indicating stability. Sucrose was used as cryoprotectant during lyophilization. DSC and XRD studies indicated that etoposide was present in the amorphous phase and may have been homogeneously dispersed in the PLGA matrix. The electron micrographs showed spherical, discrete and homogenous particles. Drug release study showed that etoposide loaded PLGA nanoparticles sustained release up to 72h. The release from the nanoparticles followed first order kinetics and mechanism of drug release was Fickian. Stability studies indicated that it was best to store nanoparticle formulations in the freeze dried state at 2-8 degrees C where they remained stable in terms of both size and drug content upto three months.","['Yadav, Khushwant S', 'Sawant, Krutika K']","['Yadav KS', 'Sawant KK']","['TIFAC- Centre of Relevance and Excellence in NDDS, Pharmacy Department, The M.

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ambulatory treatment center of a major comprehensive cancer center in the southern United States. SAMPLE: Convenience sample of 194 caregivers of patients receiving chemotherapy for leukemia. METHODS: Participants completed the Caregiver Quality-of-Life-Cancer Scale, the Caregiver Well-Being Scale, and the Learning Needs Questionnaire developed by the authors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic characteristics of the caregivers, and exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify meaningful factors. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: QOL, well-being, and learning needs. FINDINGS: Caregivers identified burden as their most important concern for QOL. Key factors identified with caregivers' well-being were expression of feelings and household maintenance. Caregivers identified giving medications and managing the side effects as crucial to learning needs. Communication, positive attitudes, support, and education were important in promoting QOL for the caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiving for a patient receiving chemotherapy for leukemia influences the QOL and well-being of the caregiver. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: This study highlights the need for better nurse-caregiver communication and education, particularly in the areas of symptom management and medication administration. Additional research should focus on factors that affect caregivers' QOL, their educational needs, and improved interventions for delivering new information or reinforcing old information.","['Tamayo, Geline Joy', 'Broxson, Anita', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Cohen, Marlene Z']","['Tamayo GJ', 'Broxson A', 'Munsell M', 'Cohen MZ']","['Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. gtamayo@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ambulatory Care/psychology', '*Attitude to Health', 'Caregivers/education/*psychology', 'Communication', '*Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Empathy', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'United States']",2010/01/02 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2010/01/02 06:00'],"['2010/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['J47U07XN48125500 [pii]', '10.1188/10.ONF.E50-E57 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2010 Jan;37(1):E50-7. doi: 10.1188/10.ONF.E50-E57.,10.1188/10.ONF.E50-E57 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the challenges from high dimension and small sample size of tumor dataset still exist. This paper presents a new tumor classification approach based on an ensemble of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and neighborhood rough set model based gene reduction. Informative genes were initially selected by gene ranking based on an iterative search margin algorithm and then were further refined by gene reduction to select many minimum gene subsets. Finally, the candidate base PNN classifiers trained by each of the selected gene subsets were integrated by majority voting strategy to construct an ensemble classifier. Experiments on tumor datasets showed that this approach can obtain both high and stable classification performance, which is not too sensitive to the number of initially selected genes and competitive to most existing methods. Additionally, the classification results can be cross-verified in a single biomedical experiment by the selected gene subsets, and biologically experimental results also proved that the genes included in the selected gene subsets are functionally related to carcinogenesis, indicating that the performance obtained by the proposed method is convincing.","['Wang, Shu-Lin', 'Li, Xueling', 'Zhang, Shanwen', 'Gui, Jie', 'Huang, De-Shuang']","['Wang SL', 'Li X', 'Zhang S', 'Gui J', 'Huang DS']","['Hunan University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Comput Biol Med,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Data Mining', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Neuroblastoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Probability', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/classification/diagnosis/genetics']",2010/01/02 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2010/01/02 06:00'],"['2008/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0010-4825(09)00209-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.compbiomed.2009.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Med. 2010 Feb;40(2):179-89. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2009.11.014.

We longitudinally assessed by Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) skeletal modifications during this treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four newly diagnosed ALL children underwent bone measurement by QUS parameters BTT (Bone Transmission Time) and AD-SoS (Amplitude-Dependent Speed of Sound), mainly reliant on bone density and cortical thickness, respectively. Measurements were performed at diagnosis, and 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. The occurrence of skeletal complications such as fractures, vertebral collapse, osteonecrosis, and osteopenia was related to measurement outcome. RESULTS: A rapid deterioration of bone properties measured by BTT and AD-SoS was evident in the first semester of therapy (p<0.001). Subsequently, the next measurements were characterized by progressive uncoupling of the two QUS parameters (p<0.001). These were both significantly reduced at the end of therapy (p<0.001). Twelve subjects with in-treatment skeletal complications displayed an almost two-fold decrease of both parameters (p<0.001). BTT decreasing more than 1 Standard Deviation (SD) over 6 months of therapy was able to predict skeletal complication occurrence (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This report represents the largest longitudinal cohort systematically submitted to bone condition assessment from the beginning to the end of therapy for childhood ALL. Bone deterioration occurs early and persists throughout therapy, consistent with bone properties uncoupling. This pattern possibly reflects an initial impairment of both mineral density and cortical thickness with a subsequent recovery of this latter. QUS permits an early detection of bone deterioration and related skeletal complications in childhood ALL.","['Mussa, Alessandro', 'Bertorello, Nicoletta', 'Porta, Francesco', 'Galletto, Chiara', 'Nicolosi, Mario Guido', 'Manicone, Rosaria', 'Corrias, Andrea', 'Fagioli, Franca']","['Mussa A', 'Bertorello N', 'Porta F', 'Galletto C', 'Nicolosi MG', 'Manicone R', 'Corrias A', 'Fagioli F']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, University of Torino, Regina Margherita Children Hospital, Piazza Polonia 94, 10126, Torino, Italy. mussa_alessandro@yahoo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Density/drug effects', 'Bone and Bones/*diagnostic imaging/drug effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytosine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fractures, Bone/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Osteonecrosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Osteoporosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2010/01/02 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2010/01/02 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S8756-3282(09)02113-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2009.12.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2010 Apr;46(4):1016-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2009.12.019.

Here we explore a positive feedback mechanism of H(2)O(2)-mediated regulation of the phagocyte respiratory burst NADPH oxidase (NOX2). H(2)O(2) induced a dose-dependent stimulation of superoxide production in human neutrophils, as well as in K562 leukemia cells overexpressing NOX2 system components. Stimulation was abrogated by the addition of catalase, the extracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA, the T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor mibefradil, the PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin, or the c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate or by overexpression of a dominant-negative form of c-Abl. H(2)O(2) induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 311 on PKCdelta and this activating phosphorylation was blocked by treatment with rottlerin, imatinib mesylate, or BAPTA. Rac GTPase activation in response to H(2)O(2) was abrogated by BAPTA, imatinib mesylate, or rottlerin. In conclusion, H(2)O(2) stimulates NOX2-mediated superoxide generation in neutrophils and K562/NOX2 cells via a signaling pathway involving Ca(2+) influx and c-Abl tyrosine kinase acting upstream of PKCdelta. This positive feedback regulatory pathway has important implications for amplifying the innate immune response and contributing to oxidative stress in inflammatory disorders.","['El Jamali, Amina', 'Valente, Anthony J', 'Clark, Robert A']","['El Jamali A', 'Valente AJ', 'Clark RA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, and South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie L.

The method requires neither the prior knowledge of the underlying distribution nor the number of cases before scanning. In this paper, the semiparametric cluster detection procedure is combined with Storey's q-value, a type of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) method, to take into account the multiple testing problem induced by the overlapping scanning windows. RESULTS: It is shown by simulations that for binary data, using Kulldorff's Northeastern benchmark data, the semiparametric method and Kulldorff's method performs similarly well. When the data are not binary, the semiparametric methodology still works in many cases, but Kulldorff's method requires the choices of a correct probability model, namely the correct scan statistic, in order to achieve comparable power as the semiparametric method achieves. Kulldorff's method with an inappropriate probability model may lose power. CONCLUSIONS: The semiparametric method proposed in the paper can achieve good power when detecting localized cluster. The method does not require a specific distributional assumption other than the tilt function. In addition, it is possible to adapt other scan schemes (e.g., elliptic spatial scan, flexible shape scan) to search for clusters as well.","['Wen, Shihua', 'Kedem, Benjamin']","['Wen S', 'Kedem B']","['Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA. leafwen@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Health Geogr,International journal of health geographics,101152198,,IM,"['Biometry/methods', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Paternal Exposure', '*Poisson Distribution', '*Space-Time Clustering', 'United States/epidemiology']",2010/01/02 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2010/01/02 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-072X-8-73 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-072X-8-73 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Health Geogr. 2009 Dec 31;8:73. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-8-73.,10.1186/1476-072X-8-73 [doi],20091231,,,,,PMC2817681,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a rare disease, can be treated effectively, but the pharmaceutical treatment available (imatinib) is costly and unaffordable by most patients. GIPAP, is a programme set up between a manufacturer and an NGO to provide free treatment to eligible CML patients in 80 countries worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To discuss the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of patients participating in GIPAP; to research the impact GIPAP is having on health outcomes (survival) of assistance-eligible CML patients; and to discuss the determinants of such outcomes and whether there are any variations according to socio-economic, demographic, or geographical criteria. METHODS: Data for 13,568 patients across 15 countries, available quarterly, were analysed over the 2005-2007 period. Ordered Probit panel data analysis was used to analyze the determinants of a patient's progress in terms of participation in the programme. Four waves of patients entering quarterly in 2005 were used to evaluate patient survival over the sample period. RESULTS: All patients in the sample are eligible to receive treatment provided they report to a facility quarterly. 62.3% of patients were male and 37.7% female. The majority (84.4%) entered during the chronic phase of the disease and their average age was 38.4 years. Having controlled for age, location and occupation, the analysis showed that patients were significantly much more likely to move towards a better health state after receiving treatment irrespective of their disease stage at the point of entry to the program (OR = 30.5, alpha = 1%); and that the larger the gap between diagnosis and approval for participation in the program, the more likely it is that patients' condition deteriorates (OR = 0.995, alpha = 1%), due to absence of treatment. Regressions to account for the effect of large countries (India, China, Pakistan) did not show any important differences when compared to the remaining countries in the sample. Survival analysis shows that at least 66 percent of all patients that entered the program in 2005 were alive and active by the end of 2007. CONCLUSIONS: GIPAP has a significant positive effect on patient access to important medicines for a life threatening condition such as CML. It impacts both the progress and phase of the disease and leads to a high survival rate. Overall, it sets a good example for access to treatment in developing countries, where such programmes can substitute or complement local efforts to provide care to eligible patients.","['Kanavos, Panos', 'Vandoros, Sotiris', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, Pat']","['Kanavos P', 'Vandoros S', 'Garcia-Gonzalez P']","['LSE Health, The London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Global Health,Globalization and health,101245734,,,,2010/01/02 06:00,2010/01/02 06:01,['2010/01/02 06:00'],"['2008/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['1744-8603-5-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1744-8603-5-19 [doi]']",epublish,Global Health. 2009 Dec 31;5:19. doi: 10.1186/1744-8603-5-19.,10.1186/1744-8603-5-19 [doi],20091231,,,,,PMC2806257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cells, ara-G is phosphorylated to ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP), which is subsequently incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Because ara-GTP is crucial to ara-G's cytotoxicity, the determination of ara-GTP production in cancer cells is informative for optimizing nelarabine administration. Here, we developed a new, sensitive isocratic-elution HPLC method for quantifying ara-GTP. Samples were eluted isocratically by using phosphate buffer at a constant flow rate. Ara-GTP was clearly separated from other nucleotides by using an anion-exchange column and it was quantitated by its peak area at 254 nm. The standard curve was linear with low variability and a sensitive detection limit (10 pmol). Furthermore, due to ara-G's specificity to T-cells we hypothesized that nelarabine might be effective against adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The ara-GTP production was compared between T-lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM and ATL cell lines in vitro. When CEM cells were incubated with ara-G, the ara-GTP production increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, 5 ATL cell lines accumulated lower ara-GTP in the same condition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 649 confirmed NHLN cases and 1298 individually gender-age-matched patient controls at 25 hospitals in Shanghai. A 17-page questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, medical history, family history, lifestyle risk factors, employment history, residential history, and occupational and non-occupational exposures. Risk estimates were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Potential risk factors of NHLN (all subtypes combined) or individual subtypes included low-level education, home or workplace renovation, living on a farm, planting crops, and raising livestock or animals. Some risk factors applied to all or most subtypes (such as lowlevel education, living on a farm, and raising livestock or animals), whereas others did not (such as the use of traditional Chinese medicines, which was associated with a reduced risk). Blood transfusions, hair dyes, or living near high-voltage power lines were not associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a number of risk factors for NHLN overall and specific subtypes. Some risk factors were subtype-specific. The difference in risk by subtype underscores the etiologic commonality and heterogeneity of NHLN subtypes.","['Wong, Otto', 'Harris, Fran', 'Wang, Yiying', 'Fu, Hua']","['Wong O', 'Harris F', 'Wang Y', 'Fu H']","['Applied Health Sciences, San Mateo, Calif 94401, USA. ottowong@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Agriculture', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Construction Materials', 'Educational Status', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*etiology', '*Life Style', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/classification/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors']",2010/01/01 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2010/01/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181c5c399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2010 Jan;52(1):39-53. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181c5c399.,10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181c5c399 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent fluorescent in situ hybridization and molecular cloning studies have identified several novel IGH translocations involving genes that play important roles in normal hemopoiesis, including the cytokine receptor genes CRLF2 and EPOR, all members of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein gene family, as well as genes not normally expressed in hemopoietic cells including inhibitor of DNA binding 4. IGH translocation results in deregulated target gene expression because of juxtaposition with IGH transcriptional enhancers. However, many genes targeted by IGH translocations are also more commonly deregulated in BCP-ALL as a consequence of other genetic or epigenetic mechanisms. For example, interstitial genomic deletions also result in deregulated CRLF2 expression, whereas EPOR expression is deregulated as a consequence of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion. The possible clinical importance of many of the various IGH translocations in BCP-ALL remains to be determined from prospective studies, but CRLF2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite their rarity, IGH chromosomal translocations in BCP-ALL therefore define not only new mechanisms of B-cell transformation but also clinically important subgroups of disease and suggest new targeted therapeutic approaches.","['Dyer, Martin J S', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Capasso, Melania', 'Dusanjh, Palminder', 'Lee, Yin Fai', 'Karran, E Loraine', 'Nagel, Inga', 'Vater, Inga', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Siebert, Reiner']","['Dyer MJ', 'Akasaka T', 'Capasso M', 'Dusanjh P', 'Lee YF', 'Karran EL', 'Nagel I', 'Vater I', 'Cario G', 'Siebert R']","['MRC Toxicology Unit and Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester, United Kingdom. mjsd1@le.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ID4 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/*metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/01/01 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2010/01/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56718-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-235986 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 25;115(8):1490-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-235986.

The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor family is well known for its role in eliciting inflammation and promoting cell survival. We discovered that human megakaryocytes and platelets express the majority of NF-kappaB family members, including the regulatory inhibitor-kappaB (I-kappaB) and I-kappa kinase (IKK) molecules. METHODS AND RESULTS: Anucleate platelets exposed to NF-kappaB inhibitors demonstrated impaired fundamental functions involved in repairing vascular injury and thrombus formation. Specifically, NF-kappaB inhibition diminished lamellapodia formation, decreased clot retraction times, and reduced thrombus stability. Moreover, inhibition of I-kappaB-alpha phosphorylation (BAY-11-7082) reverted fully spread platelets back to a spheroid morphology. Addition of recombinant IKK-beta or I-kappaB-alpha protein to BAY inhibitor-treated platelets partially restored platelet spreading in I-kappaB-alpha inhibited platelets, and addition of active IKK-beta increased endogenous I-kappaB-alpha phosphorylation levels. CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings support a crucial and nonclassical role for the NF-kappaB family in modulating platelet function and reveal that platelets are sensitive to NF-kappaB inhibitors. As NF-kappaB inhibitors are being developed as antiinflammatory and anticancer agents, they may have unintended effects on platelets. On the basis of these data, NF-kappaB is also identified as a new target to dampen unwanted platelet activation.","['Spinelli, Sherry L', 'Casey, Ann E', 'Pollock, Stephen J', 'Gertz, Jacqueline M', 'McMillan, David H', 'Narasipura, Srinivasa D', 'Mody, Nipa A', 'King, Michael R', 'Maggirwar, Sanjay B', 'Francis, Charles W', 'Taubman, Mark B', 'Blumberg, Neil', 'Phipps, Richard P']","['Spinelli SL', 'Casey AE', 'Pollock SJ', 'Gertz JM', 'McMillan DH', 'Narasipura SD', 'Mody NA', 'King MR', 'Maggirwar SB', 'Francis CW', 'Taubman MB', 'Blumberg N', 'Phipps RP']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, Box 850, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",2010/01/01 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2010/01/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.109.197343 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.197343 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2010 Mar;30(3):591-8. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.197343.

Molecular mechanisms controlling the unique characteristics of ESCs are still largely unknown. We identified Dies1 (Differentiation of ESCs 1), an unpublished gene, that encodes a type I membrane protein. ESCs stably transfected with Dies1 small hairpin RNAs failed to properly differentiate toward neural and cardiac cell fate upon appropriate stimuli and continued to express markers of undifferentiated cells, such as the membrane-associated alkaline phosphatase, and transcription factors, like Oct3/4 and Nanog, when grown under conditions promoting differentiation. Our results demonstrated that Dies1 is required for BMP4/Smad1 signaling cascade; in undifferentiated ESCs Dies1 knockdown did not affect the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor downstream targets, whereas it resulted in a strong decrease of BMP4 signaling, as demonstrated by the decrease of Id1, -2, and -3 mRNAs, the decreased activity of Id1 gene promoter, and the reduced phospho-Smad1 levels. Dies1 knockdown had no effect in murine ESCs when the expression of the BMP4 receptor Alk3 was suppressed. The phenotype induced by Dies1 suppression in ESCs is due to the indirect activation of the Nodal/Activin pathway, which is a consequence of the BMP4 pathway inhibition and is sufficient to support the mESC undifferentiated state in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor.","['Aloia, Luigi', 'Parisi, Silvia', 'Fusco, Ludovico', 'Pastore, Lucio', 'Russo, Tommaso']","['Aloia L', 'Parisi S', 'Fusco L', 'Pastore L', 'Russo T']","['CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate, 80145 Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nodal Protein)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Smad1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vsir protein, mouse)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nodal Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Smad1 Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2010/01/01 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2010/01/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)58760-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.077156 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Mar 5;285(10):7776-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.077156.

In this study, we show that receptor reorganization within the contacting mast cell membrane is markedly different upon binding of mobile and immobilized ligands. Rat basophilic leukemia mast cells primed with fluorescent anti-DNP IgE were engaged by surfaces presenting either bilayer-incorporated, monovalent DNP-lipid (mobile ligand), or chemically cross-linked, multivalent DNP (immobilized ligand). Total internal reflection fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy methods were used to visualize receptor reorganization at the contact site. The spatial relationships of Fc epsilonRI to other cellular components at the synapse, such as actin, cholesterol, and linker for activation of T cells, were also analyzed. Stimulation of mast cells with immobilized polyvalent ligand resulted in typical levels of degranulation. Remarkably, degranulation also followed interaction of mast cells, with bilayers presenting mobile, monovalent ligand. Receptors engaged with mobile ligand coalesce into large, cholesterol-rich clusters that occupy the central portion of the contacting membrane. These data indicate that Fc epsilonRI cross-linking is not an obligatory step in triggering mast cell signaling and suggest that dense populations of mobile receptors are capable of initiating low-level degranulation upon ligand recognition.","['Carroll-Portillo, Amanda', 'Spendier, Kathrin', 'Pfeiffer, Janet', 'Griffiths, Gary', 'Li, Haitao', 'Lidke, Keith A', 'Oliver, Janet M', 'Lidke, Diane S', 'Thomas, James L', 'Wilson, Bridget S', 'Timlin, Jerilyn A']","['Carroll-Portillo A', 'Spendier K', 'Pfeiffer J', 'Griffiths G', 'Li H', 'Lidke KA', 'Oliver JM', 'Lidke DS', 'Thomas JL', 'Wilson BS', 'Timlin JA']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Lat protein, rat)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Immunological Synapses/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/chemistry/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Surface Properties']",2010/01/01 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2010/01/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903071 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Feb 1;184(3):1328-38. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903071.

This incompatibility has been mapped to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GaLV Env. Surprisingly, we found that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu modulates this incompatibility. The infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env was not affected by Vpu. However, the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with an MLV Env with the cytoplasmic tail from GaLV Env (MLV/GaLV Env) was restricted 50- to 100-fold by Vpu. A Vpu mutant containing a scrambled membrane-spanning domain, Vpu(RD), was still able to restrict MLV/GaLV Env, but mutation of the serine residues at positions 52 and 56 completely alleviated the restriction. Loss of infectivity appeared to be caused by reduced MLV/GaLV Env incorporation into viral particles. The mechanism of this downmodulation appears to be distinct from Vpu-mediated CD4 downmodulation because Vpu-expressing cells that failed to produce infectious HIV-1 particles nonetheless continued to display robust surface MLV/GaLV Env expression. In addition, if MLV and HIV-1 were simultaneously introduced into the same cells, only the HIV-1 particle infectivity was restricted by Vpu. Collectively, these data suggest that Vpu modulates the cellular distribution of MLV/GaLV Env, preventing its recruitment to HIV-1 budding sites.","['Lucas, Tiffany M', 'Lyddon, Terri D', 'Cannon, Paula M', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Lucas TM', 'Lyddon TD', 'Cannon PM', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Christopher S.

In the case of telomerase deficiency, the mechanisms for maintaining the lengths of telomeres are referred to as alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT). The characteristics of the ALT cells include great heterogeneity of telomere size in individual cells, ALT-associated PML (promyelocytic leukemia) bodies, and evident homologous recombination.

One issue is that gene expression from viral or internal promoters is highly variable and essentially unregulated. Moreover, with retroviral vectors, gene expression is usually silenced over time. Mammalian genes, in contrast, are characterized by highly regulated, precise levels of expression in both a temporal and a cell-specific manner. To ascertain if recapitulation of endogenous adenosine deaminase (ADA) expression can be achieved in a vector construct we created a new series of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) based retroviral vector that carry human regulatory elements including combinations of the ADA promoter, the ADA locus control region (LCR), ADA introns and human polyadenylation sequences in a self-inactivating vector backbone. METHODS: A MuLV-based retroviral vector with a self-inactivating (SIN) backbone, the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), as a reporter gene, was generated. Subsequent vectors were constructed from this basic vector by deletion or addition of certain elements. The added elements that were assessed are the human ADA promoter, human ADA locus control region (LCR), introns 7, 8, and 11 from the human ADA gene, and human growth hormone polyadenylation signal. Retroviral vector particles were produced by transient three-plasmid transfection of 293T cells. Retroviral vectors encoding eGFP were titered by transducing 293A cells, and then the proportion of GFP-positive cells was determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Non T-cell and T-cell lines were transduced at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and the yield of eGFP transgene expression was evaluated by FACS analysis using mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) detection. RESULTS: Vectors that contained the ADA LCR were preferentially expressed in T-cell lines. Further improvements in T-cell specific gene expression were observed with the incorporation of additional cis-regulatory elements, such as a human polyadenylation signal and intron 7 from the human ADA gene. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the combination of an authentically regulated ADA gene in a murine retroviral vector, together with additional locus-specific regulatory refinements, will yield a vector with a safer profile and greater efficacy in terms of high-level, therapeutic, regulated gene expression for the treatment of ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency.","['Trinh, Alice T', 'Ball, Bret G', 'Weber, Erin', 'Gallaher, Timothy K', 'Gluzman-Poltorak, Zoya', 'Anderson, French', 'Basile, Lena A']","['Trinh AT', 'Ball BG', 'Weber E', 'Gallaher TK', 'Gluzman-Poltorak Z', 'Anderson F', 'Basile LA']","['Neumedicines Inc, Pasadena, California 91107, USA. atrinh@neumedicines.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genet Vaccines Ther,Genetic vaccines and therapy,101178414,,,,2010/01/01 06:00,2010/01/01 06:01,['2010/01/01 06:00'],"['2009/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1479-0556-7-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-0556-7-13 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Vaccines Ther. 2009 Dec 30;7:13. doi: 10.1186/1479-0556-7-13.,10.1186/1479-0556-7-13 [doi],20091230,,,,,PMC2809042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: Many pediatric cancer survivors at risk for transfusion-acquired HCV are unaware of their transfusion history and prior testing for HCV and would benefit from programs to increase HCV knowledge and screening.","['Lansdale, Meagan', 'Castellino, Sharon', 'Marina, Neyssa', 'Goodman, Pamela', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Smith, Stephanie M', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Lansdale M', 'Castellino S', 'Marina N', 'Goodman P', 'Hudson MM', 'Mertens AC', 'Smith SM', 'Leisenring W', 'Robison LL', 'Oeffinger KC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Hepatitis C/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Survivors', 'Transfusion Reaction']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24810 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Feb 15;116(4):974-82. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24810.,10.1002/cncr.24810 [doi],,,,,"['R25 CA122061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA-55,727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2819650,,,['NIHMS156710'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In myeloid diseases we have seen dramatic improvements in the overall survival and quality of life for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with ABL and Src/ABL kinase inhibitors and we are poised to discover whether JAK2 inhibitors may offer similar benefit in myeloproliferative diseases. For acute myeloid leukaemia, the introduction of ATRA and myelotarg have had major impacts on the design of therapy regimens and many novel targeted agents, including farnesyl transferase, FLT3 and histone deacetylase inhibitors, are now in clinical trial. In lymphoid malignancies the highlight has been the introduction of rituximab, with significant improvements in the management of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The last 10 years has experienced a rapidly expanding interest and acceptance that leukaemic stem cells, including an improved ability to target them, may hold the key to improved response and reduced relapse rates across both myeloid and lymphoid disease.

HTLV-I infects primarily CD4(+) T cells and the transmission occurs through direct cell-to-cell contact. HAM/TSP patients harbor higher proviral loads in peripheral blood lymphocytes than asymptomatic carriers. Also, HAM/TSP patients exhibit a remarkably high number of circulating HTLV-I-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the peripheral blood. While CTLs have a protective role by killing the infected cells and lowering the proviral load, a high level of CTLs and their cytotoxicity are believed to be a main cause of the development of HAM/TSP. A mathematical model for HTLV-I infection of CD4(+) T cells that incorporates the CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response is investigated. Our mathematical analysis reveals that the system can stabilize at a carrier steady-state with persistent viral infection but no CTL response, or at a HAM/TSP steady-state at which both the viral infection and CTL response are persistent. We also establish two threshold parameters R(0) and R(1), the basic reproduction numbers for viral persistence and for CTL response, respectively. We show that the parameter R(1) can be used to distinguish asymptomatic carriers from HAM/TSP patients, and as an important control parameter for preventing the development of HAM/TSP.","['Gomez-Acevedo, Horacio', 'Li, Michael Y', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Gomez-Acevedo H', 'Li MY', 'Jacobson S']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier State/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Models, Immunological', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Virus Latency/immunology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/06/11 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2008/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11538-009-9465-z [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2010 Apr;72(3):681-96. doi: 10.1007/s11538-009-9465-z.

We studied 279 unselected patients below the age of 18 years with newly diagnosed ALL. Cases were classified according to immunophenotype: 216 (77.42%) precursor B-cell phenotype (pB-cell), mature B-cell in 4 (1.43%), and T-cell in 59 (21.15%) cases. The subclassification using the CD10 antibody revealed 197 cases pB-ALL CD10+ (91.2%) and 9 cases T-ALL CD10+ (19.2%). The age distribution showed a peak in incidence between 3 and 5 years among the pB-cell ALLs subtype. There was a significantly higher frequency of males in the T-ALL subset (M/F ratio: 2.93 : 1) and more females in the T-ALL CD10+ subset when compared with the T-ALL CD10- subset. All tested pB-cell-lineage ALLs expressed CD19, CD79a, and surface CD22, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was detectable in 89.9% of cases, and cells in 74.1% of cases express CD34. All tested T-lineage ALL cells have surface CD7 and cytoplasmic CD3 (cCD3) antigens, CD5 was found in 98.2% cases, and 70.5% express TdT. CD1a, surface CD3 (sCD3), and CD4 are detected in more than 80% of cases; this frequency is higher than the 45% generally observed. Myeloid antigens occur more frequently and were expressed in 124 (57.4%) of pB-cell-ALL cases and 20 (33.9%) of T-cell ALL cases. Our results show that the distribution of ALLs in Moroccan children is similar with the general distribution pattern in developed countries except for the high frequency of T-ALL phenotype. The phenotypic profiles of our patients are close to those reported in literature for B-lineage ALLs; for the T-cell ALL subgroup, the blast cells express more CD1a, surface CD3, and CD4 while expressing less TdT. The high frequency of CD1a expression resulted in an excess of the common thymocyte subtype.","['Bachir, Fatima', 'Bennani, Sanae', 'Lahjouji, Ali', 'Cherkaoui, Siham', ""Harif, M'hamed"", 'Khattab, Mohamed', 'Nassereddine, Ilham', 'Zafad, Saadia', 'El Aouad, Rajae']","['Bachir F', 'Bennani S', 'Lahjouji A', 'Cherkaoui S', 'Harif M', 'Khattab M', 'Nassereddine I', 'Zafad S', 'El Aouad R']","[""Laboratoire de cytometrie en flux, Institut National d'Hygiene, Rabat, Morocco.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Int J Pediatr,International journal of pediatrics,101517077,,,,2009/12/31 06:00,2009/12/31 06:01,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/674801 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Pediatr. 2009;2009:674801. doi: 10.1155/2009/674801.

One way to obtain information about indoor levels of PAHs is to measure these chemicals in house dust. In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of self-reported and geographic data for estimating measured levels of nine PAHs in house dust from 583 households in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS). Using multivariable linear regression models, we evaluated the effects on house-dust PAH concentrations from the following covariates: residential heating sources, smoking habits, house characteristics, and outdoor emission sources. House dust was collected from 2001 to 2007, using both high-volume surface samplers and household vacuum cleaners, and was analyzed for nine PAHs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All nine PAHs were detected in more than 93% of dust samples, with median concentrations ranging from 14 to 94 ng/g dust. Statistically significant effects on PAH concentrations in house dust were found for gas heating, outdoor PAH concentrations, and residence age. Yet, the optimal regression model only explained 15% of the variation in PAH levels in house dust. As self-reported data and outdoor PAH sources were only marginally predictive of observed PAH levels, we recommend that PAH concentrations be measured directly in dust samples for use in epidemiological studies.","['Whitehead, Todd', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Gunier, Robert B', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Nishioka, Marcia G', 'Buffler, Patricia', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Whitehead T', 'Metayer C', 'Gunier RB', 'Ward MH', 'Nishioka MG', 'Buffler P', 'Rappaport SM']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. toddpwhitehead@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,101262796,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Dust)', '0 (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*analysis/chemistry', 'California', 'Dust/*analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Linear Models', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/*analysis', 'Smoking/epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors']",2009/12/31 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jes200968 [pii]', '10.1038/jes.2009.68 [doi]']",ppublish,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol. 2011 Mar-Apr;21(2):123-32. doi: 10.1038/jes.2009.68.

The 5-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 30%, 34%, 22%, and 0%, respectively. A risk-factor analysis was performed for patients who underwent transplantation in remission (n = 102). Five-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence (RI), and LFS were 37%, 36%, and 27%, respectively. A trend of improved LFS rate and decreased RI was observed for children given a graft with higher number of CD34(+) cells (adjusted P = .09 and P = .07, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, haploHSCT performed in larger centers (performing > or = 231 allotransplantations in the studied period) was associated with improved LFS rate and decreased RI (adjusted P = .01 and P = .04, respectively), adjusting for different patient-, disease-, and transplant-related factors such as number of previous autotransplantations, cytomegalovirus serology status, type of T-cell depletion, and use of total body irradiation and antithymocyte globulin. In conclusion, higher CD34(+) cell dose and better patient selection may improve outcomes of children with ALL who undergo a haploHSCT.

A small percentage of patients relapse because of the proliferation of escape clones; such relapses can be treated with second-generation drugs. Early detection and monitoring of resistant clones may provide clinical benefit. We describe the development and testing of a new approach for quantitative monitoring of CML resistance. METHODS: We designed mutation-specific assays that use hydrolysis probes and an array of allele-specific primers containing nucleotides mismatched at various positions. All assays were tested with plasmids containing corresponding mutant or wild-type sequences, allowing identification of optimal assays for specific and effective amplification of the target template. Clinical samples were then used to compare the results of selected assays with those of standard genotyping. RESULTS: We used a modified amplification refractory mutational system approach and testing with plasmid constructs to design assays that allowed highly selective detection of resistance for all target mutations. By taking advantage of single-step performance and high PCR efficiency, we were able to quantitatively track the absolute amount of resistance conferred by a specific mutation over 4 orders of magnitude. Moreover, we designed an integrated test for dasatinib resistance that uses multiple primers simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: These single-step, closed-tube assays specifically target mutations associated with resistance to dasatinib or nilotinib. Compared with standard genotyping, such biased genotyping improves the detection of resistance or alternative features via quantitative analysis of the absolute amount of resistance.","['Gruber, Franz X', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Kiselev, Yuri', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Mikkola, Ingvild']","['Gruber FX', 'Ernst T', 'Kiselev Y', 'Hochhaus A', 'Mikkola I']","['Department of Pharmacy, Section of Pharmacology, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clone Cells/*drug effects', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2009.133843 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2009.133843 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2010 Mar;56(3):469-73. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2009.133843.

However, the molecular link between transcriptional control and chromatin reconfiguration remains unclear. By colocalization of the nuclear ecdysone receptor (EcR) on the ecdysone-induced puff in the salivary gland, Drosophila DEK (dDEK) was genetically identified as a coactivator of EcR in both insect cells and intact flies. Biochemical purification and characterization of the complexes containing fly and human DEKs revealed that DEKs serve as histone chaperones via phosphorylation by forming complexes with casein kinase 2. Consistent with the preferential association of the DEK complex with histones enriched in active epigenetic marks, dDEK facilitated H3.3 assembly during puff formation. In some human myeloid leukemia patients, DEK was fused to CAN by chromosomal translocation. This mutation significantly reduced formation of the DEK complex, which is required for histone chaperone activity. Thus, the present study suggests that at least one histone chaperone can be categorized as a type of transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors.","['Sawatsubashi, Shun', 'Murata, Takuya', 'Lim, Jinseon', 'Fujiki, Ryoji', 'Ito, Saya', 'Suzuki, Eriko', 'Tanabe, Masahiko', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Kimura, Shuhei', 'Fujiyama, Sally', 'Ueda, Takashi', 'Umetsu, Daiki', 'Ito, Takashi', 'Takeyama, Ken-ichi', 'Kato, Shigeaki']","['Sawatsubashi S', 'Murata T', 'Lim J', 'Fujiki R', 'Ito S', 'Suzuki E', 'Tanabe M', 'Zhao Y', 'Kimura S', 'Fujiyama S', 'Ueda T', 'Umetsu D', 'Ito T', 'Takeyama K', 'Kato S']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '3604-87-3 (Ecdysone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Dek protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Eph Family)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Ecdysone/metabolism', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Histone Chaperones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Eph Family/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/02/09 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['gad.1857410 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1857410 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Jan 15;24(2):159-70. doi: 10.1101/gad.1857410.

BRAP2 inhibition of nuclear accumulation was dependent on phosphorylation sites flanking the respective NLSs, where substitution of the cyclin-dependent kinase site T124 of T-ag with Ala or Asp prevented or enhanced BRAP2 inhibition of nuclear import, respectively. Substitution of T427 within the NLS of ppUL44 gave similar results, whereas no effect of BRAP2 was observed on nuclear targeting of other viral proteins, such as herpes simplex virus-1 pUL30, which lacks a phosphorylation site near its NLS, and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein.

One hundred and eighteen children with ALL who received MTX at the dose of 2 - 3.5 g/m(2) were enrolled in this study. 96 children were enrolled in the index group and 22 children in the validation group. The data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effect model (NONMEM) software. A linear two-compartment model with linear elimination best described the data. The forward inclusion-backward elimination method was used to investigate the different covariates, including age, body weight, gender, etc. The Bayesian method was used to predict the individual pharmacokinetic parameters. Validation was applied using an internal and external approach. The population pharmacokinetic parameters and 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained as follows: The clearance of central compartment (CL1), apparent volume of distribution of central compartment (V1), the clearance between central and peripheral compartment (CL2), and apparent volume of distribution of peripheral compartment (V2) were 5.04 (3.93 - 6.15) l/min, 16.1 (12.5 - 19.7) l, 0.203 (0.102 - 0.304) l/min and 7.05 (3.86 - 10.20) l, respectively. The inter-individual variability of CL1, V1, CL2, and V2 were 49.60%, 29.36%, 137.64%, and 107.70%, respectively. Gender, body surface area and the amount of alkalinization agent during 24 hours before MTX administration had significant effects on CL1. A strong relationship was found in this study between CL2 and age, as well as between V2 and age. A good correlation was further proved through the validation model.

Utilizing the SCID mouse model, we examined the growth potential of leukemic blasts from 133 patients with acute leukemia, (67 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 66 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) in the animals after subcutaneous inoculation without conditioning treatment. The blasts displayed three distinct growth patterns: ""aggressive"", ""indolent"", or ""no tumor growth"". Out of 133 leukemias, 45 (33.8%) displayed an aggressive growth pattern, 14 (10.5%) displayed an indolent growth pattern and 74 (55.6%) did not grow in SCID mice. The growth probability of leukemias from relapsed and/or refractory disease was nearly 3 fold higher than that from patients with newly diagnosed disease. Serial observations found that leukemic blasts from the same individual, which did not initiate tumor growth at initial presentation and/or at early relapse, may engraft and grow in the later stages of disease, suggesting that the ability of leukemia cells for engraftment and proliferation was gradually acquired following the process of leukemia progression. Nine autonomous growing leukemia cell lines were established in vitro. These displayed an aggressive proliferation pattern, suggesting a possible correlation between the capacity of human leukemia cells for autonomous proliferation in vitro and an aggressive growth potential in SCID mice. In addition, we demonstrated that patients whose leukemic blasts displayed an aggressive growth and dissemination pattern in SClD mice had a poor clinical outcome in patients with ALL as well as AML. Patients whose leukemic blasts grew indolently or whose leukemia cells failed to induce growth had a significantly longer DFS and more favorable clinical course.","['Yan, Ying', 'Wieman, Eric A', 'Guan, Xiuqin', 'Jakubowski, Ann A', 'Steinherz, Peter G', ""O'Reilly, Richard J""]","['Yan Y', 'Wieman EA', 'Guan X', 'Jakubowski AA', 'Steinherz PG', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","[""The Saint Luke's Cancer Institute, 4321 Washington, Suite 4000 Kansas City, Missouri 64111, USA. yany@umkc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-51 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Dec 29;2:51. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-51.,10.1186/1756-8722-2-51 [doi],20091229,,,,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2807866,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects of combined treatment of these drugs are controversial. In this study, the combined effects of these drugs on the induction of apoptosis in NB4 cells were investigated using the neutral comet assay. METHODS: NB4 cells were treated with various doses of arsenic trioxide (0.1 - 3 microM) and vitamin D3 (100 - 600 nM (alone or in combination. Twenty-four hours after treatment, neutral comet assay was performed and apoptotic cells were scored under a fluorescent microscope following staining with ethidium bromide. RESULTS: Results show that all doses of arsenic trioxide used in this study induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. The frequency of induced apoptosis was dose dependent and significantly higher than the controls (P<0.05 - 0.01). In contrast, vitamin D3 at concentrations of 100 - 600 nM produced no significant effect on apoptosis induction compared to the controls. Treatment of NB4 cells with a combination of arsenic trioxide and vitamin D3 resulted in reduction of apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide which was not dependent on the dose of vitamin D3 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that arsenic trioxide is a potent inducer of apoptosis in NB4 cells and vitamin D3 significantly decreased the sensitivity of cells to the induction of apoptosis by arsenic trioxide. These findings suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 might be involved in anti-apoptotic processes via reactive oxygen species scavenging or other mechanisms not yet known.","['Mozdarani, Hossein', 'Asghari, Farahnaz']","['Mozdarani H', 'Asghari F']","['Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran. mozdarah@modares.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Oxides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['008 [pii]', '010131/AIM.008 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2010 Jan;13(1):26-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since, data concerning the incidence and associations with patients characteristics vary amongst different studies, the aim of the present study is to identify and quantify the frequency of mutations in Iranian patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Internal tandem duplication and D835 mutations in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene of acute myeloid leukemia patients were studied through polymerase chain reaction and polymerase chain reaction-RFLP analysis. Amplified products for a point mutation in D816 for KIT have also been identified through the polymerase chain reaction-RFLP technique. The mutations in exon 8 of KIT were detected by using the PCR and the Conformational Sensitive Gel Electrophoresis techniques, and amplified products have been confirmed by sequencing techniques. RESULTS: Internal tandem duplication and D835 mutations in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene occurred in 18% and 6% of AML patients, respectively. Frequencies of mutation were 1.4% and 4.7% in exon 8 and D816 of the KIT gene in acute myeloid leukemia patients. These results were substantially different for various subclasses of French-American-British classification. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia patients have either KIT or fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 genetic mutations. The presence of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 was significantly associated with M3 morphology and mutations of KIT were significantly associated with M2 and M4 subtypes.","['Zaker, Farhad', 'Mohammadzadeh, Mohammad', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad']","['Zaker F', 'Mohammadzadeh M', 'Mohammadi M']","['Oncopathology Research Center, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Hemmat Freeway, Tehran, Iran. farhadz20@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2009/12/31 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['007 [pii]', '010131/AIM.007 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2010 Jan;13(1):21-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eph and ephrin overexpression have been documented in a variety of human cancers including gastrointestinal malignancies and in particular colorectal malignancies. EphB and ephrin B proteins have been implicated in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract where EphB2- and EphB3-ephrin B signaling regulates cell sorting in the mature epithelium. These proteins are also reported to be upregulated in colon carcinomas. The EphA/ephrin A system has also been implicated in epithelial tissue structure and function. More recently, EphA receptors and their corresponding ligands have been implicated in numerous malignancies. Of these, EphA2 in particular has been intensively investigated and has been proposed as a therapeutic target. An interesting observation emerging from these studies is the role for Ephs and ephrins in critical aspects of cell adhesion, migration and positioning, and a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis. However, the underlying role of Ephs and ephrins in these processes has generally been studied on individual Eph or ephrin genes. Given the multiplicity of Eph expression on gut epithelial cells, a more global approach is needed to define the precise role of Eph-ephrin interaction in malignant transformation. Here, we will review the recent advances on the role of Eph-ephrin signaling in colorectal malignancies.","['Herath, Nirmitha I', 'Boyd, Andrew W']","['Herath NI', 'Boyd AW']","['Leukaemia Foundation Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Herston, Queensland, Australia. nirmitha.herath@qimr.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Ephrins)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA1)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Ephrins/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Receptor, EphA1/analysis/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/12/30 06:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/12/30 06:00'],"['2009/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25147 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 May 1;126(9):2003-11. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25147.,10.1002/ijc.25147 [doi],,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluate sorafenib efficacy and impact on the cellular pro-survival machinery in vitro, efficacy of sorafenib as monotherapy and in combination with the naturally occurring death receptor agonist, TRAIL using human MPM cell lines, MSTO-211H, M30, REN, H28, H2052 and H2452. In vitro studies of the six MPM lines demonstrated single agent sensitivity to the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and resistance to TRAIL. H28 and H2452 demonstrated augmented apoptosis with the addition of TRAIL to sorafenib in vitro. Treated cell lines demonstrated sorafenib-induced rapid dephosphorylation of AKT followed shortly by near complete dephosphorylation of the constitutively phosphorylated ERK1/2. Sorafenib therapy also decreased phosphorylation of B-Raf and mTOR in several cell lines. Within 3 h of sorafenib treatment, a number of known pro-survival molecules were dephosphorylated and/or downregulated in expression including MCL-1(L), c-FLIP(L), survivin and cIAP(1). These changes and eventual cell death did not elicit significant caspase-3 activation or PARP cleavage and pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, did not block sorafenib efficacy but did block the effect of TRAIL monotherapy. Pre-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK did not block the synergistic effect of TRAIL and sorafenib in H28. In summary, single agent treatment with sorafenib results in widespread inhibition of the pro-survival machinery in vitro leading to cell death via a primarily caspase-independent mechanism. Combining sorafenib therapy with TRAIL, may be useful in order to provide a more efficient death signal and this synergistic effect appears to be caspase-independent. Pilot in vivo data demonstrates promising evidence of therapeutic efficacy in human tumor bearing xenograft nu/nu mice. We document single agent activity of sorafenib against MPM, unravel novel effects of sorafenib on anti-apoptotic signaling mediators, and suggest the combination of sorafenib plus TRAIL as possible therapy for clinical testing in MPM.","['Katz, Sharyn I', 'Zhou, Lanlan', 'Chao, Grace', 'Smith, Charles D', 'Ferrara, Thomas', 'Wang, Wenge', 'Dicker, David T', 'El-Deiry, Wafik S']","['Katz SI', 'Zhou L', 'Chao G', 'Smith CD', 'Ferrara T', 'Wang W', 'Dicker DT', 'El-Deiry WS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Cell Cycle Regulation, Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesothelioma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism']",2009/12/30 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2009/12/30 06:00'],"['2009/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10824 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.24.10824 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Dec;8(24):2406-16. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.24.10824.

Mitochondrial uncoupling--the continuing reduction of oxygen without ATP synthesis--has recently been shown in leukemia cells to circumvent the ability of oxygen to inhibit glycolysis, and may promote the metabolic preference for glycolysis by shifting from pyruvate oxidation to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Here we have demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FAO with etomoxir or ranolazine inhibited proliferation and sensitized human leukemia cells--cultured alone or on bone marrow stromal cells--to apoptosis induction by ABT-737, a molecule that releases proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bak from antiapoptotic family members. Likewise, treatment with the fatty acid synthase/lipolysis inhibitor orlistat also sensitized leukemia cells to ABT-737, which supports the notion that fatty acids promote cell survival. Mechanistically, we generated evidence suggesting that FAO regulates the activity of Bak-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition. Importantly, etomoxir decreased the number of quiescent leukemia progenitor cells in approximately 50% of primary human acute myeloid leukemia samples and, when combined with either ABT-737 or cytosine arabinoside, provided substantial therapeutic benefit in a murine model of leukemia.

We set out to explore whether the kind of CEBPA mutation is of prognostic relevance in cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred sixty-seven homogeneously treated patients with CN-AML were subdivided into moCEBPA, biCEBPA, and wild-type (wt) CEBPA patients. The subgroups were analyzed for clinical parameters and for additional mutations in the NPM1, FLT3, and MLL genes. Furthermore, we obtained gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: Only patients with biCEBPA had an improved median overall survival when compared with patients with wtCEBPA (not reached v 20.4 months, respectively; P = .018), whereas patients with moCEBPA (20.9 months) and wtCEBPA had a similar outcome (P = .506). Multivariable analysis confirmed biCEBPA, but not moCEBPA, mutations as an independent favorable prognostic factor. Interestingly, biCEBPA mutations, compared with wtCEBPA, were never associated with mutated NPM1 (0% v 43%, respectively; P < .001) and rarely associated with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; 5% v 23%, respectively; P = .059), whereas patients with moCEBPA had a similar frequency of mutated NPM1 and a significantly higher association with FLT3-ITD compared with patients with wtCEBPA (44% v 23%, respectively; P = .037). Furthermore, patients with biCEBPA showed a homogeneous gene expression profile that was characterized by downregulation of HOX genes, whereas patients with moCEBPA showed greater heterogeneity in their gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: Biallelic disruption of the N and C terminus of CEBPA is required for the favorable clinical outcome of CEBPA-mutated patients and represents a distinct molecular subtype of CN-AML with a different frequency of associated gene mutations. These findings are of great significance for risk-adapted therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Dufour, Annika', 'Schneider, Friederike', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Hoster, Eva', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Zellmeier, Evelyn', 'Benthaus, Tobias', 'Sauerland, Maria-Cristina', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Braess, Jan', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Dufour A', 'Schneider F', 'Metzeler KH', 'Hoster E', 'Schneider S', 'Zellmeier E', 'Benthaus T', 'Sauerland MC', 'Berdel WE', 'Buchner T', 'Wormann B', 'Braess J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Spiekermann K']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich-Grosshadern, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/12/30 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/12/30 06:00'],"['2009/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.6010 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.6010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 1;28(4):570-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.6010.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 1,658 patients younger than age 60 years to receive mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide versus cytarabine/daunorubicin/etoposide and subsequently 1,193 patients to daunorubicin/cytarabine/thioguanine (DAT) where the cytarabine dose was standard (S-DAT) versus double the standard dose (H-DAT). Patients in this randomization were randomly assigned to all-trans-retinoic acid or not. In consolidation, 992 patients were randomly assigned between a total of four courses versus five courses, and 324 patients who were not good risk were randomly assigned to transplantation or chemotherapy as the final course. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 74% of patients and CR without recovery was achieved in an additional 11%; overall survival (OS) at 8 years was 38%. No differences in CR, relapse-free survival, relapse, or OS were seen between any of the induction randomizations except for a reduction in relapse risk (RR) on the mitoxantrone arm, which was offset by increased myelosuppression and deaths in CR. The addition of a fifth course did not improve OS and may be detrimental in older patients. Although transplantation reduced RR, it did not improve OS for the intermediate-risk group but was probably of benefit in high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Several chemotherapy schedules achieved similar remission rates and OS. Four courses of chemotherapy are adequate, but the addition of transplantation as a final course does not improve OS. New agents are required to enhance conventional chemotherapy.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Milligan, Donald W', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Prentice, Archibald G', 'McMullin, Mary-Frances', 'Duncombe, Andrew', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Wheatley, Keith']","['Burnett AK', 'Hills RK', 'Milligan DW', 'Goldstone AH', 'Prentice AG', 'McMullin MF', 'Duncombe A', 'Gibson B', 'Wheatley K']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: WT1 exons 7 and 9 from 249 CN-AML patients from multicenter treatment trials AML-SHG Hannover 0199 (Clinical Trials Identifier NCT00209833) and 0295, and 50 healthy volunteers were analyzed by direct sequencing. NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and MLL were assessed for mutations and WT1 expression was quantified. RESULTS: The minor allele of SNP rs16754 (WT1(AG/GG)) was found in 25.7% of CN-AML patients' blasts and germline DNA and in 36% of healthy volunteers. Patient characteristics, frequencies of mutations, or WT1 expression levels were similarly distributed between patients homozygous for the major allele compared with patients heterozygous or homozygous for the minor allele. SNP rs16754 status was an independent predictor of relapse-free survival (RFS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.81; P = .005) and overall survival (OS; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.74; P = .002) in multivariate analysis. The favorable effect of SNP rs16754 was stronger in NPM1/FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene) high-risk patients compared with NPM1/FLT3-ITD low-risk patients. Favorable prognosis could not be identified by any other known low-risk marker in half the patients with at least one minor allele (13% of all patients). No difference for complete remission rate, RFS, or OS was found between patients with or without acquired WT1 mutations. CONCLUSION: WT1 SNP rs16754 may be a novel independent favorable-risk marker in CN-AML patients that might improve risk and treatment stratification.","['Damm, Frederik', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Morgan, Michael', 'Yun, Haiyang', 'Grosshennig, Anika', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Heit, Wolfgang', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Schlimok, Gunter', 'Raghavachar, Aruna', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Kirchner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Krauter, Jurgen']","['Damm F', 'Heuser M', 'Morgan M', 'Yun H', 'Grosshennig A', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Dohner K', 'Ottmann O', 'Lubbert M', 'Heit W', 'Kanz L', 'Schlimok G', 'Raghavachar A', 'Fiedler W', 'Kirchner H', 'Dohner H', 'Heil G', 'Ganser A', 'Krauter J']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. damm.frederik@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/12/30 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/12/30 06:00'],"['2009/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.23.0342 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.23.0342 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 1;28(4):578-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.23.0342.

Molecular characterization may predict clinical outcome and help stratify patients for targeted therapies. Epigenetic therapy using decitabine, a DNA hypomethylating agent, is clinically effective for the treatment of MDS. Therefore, we investigated the association between DNA methylation and clinical outcome in MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened 24 patients with MDS for promoter CpG island methylation of 24 genes and identified aberrant hypermethylation at 10 genes. We then performed quantitative methylation analyses by bisulfite pyrosequencing of the identified genes in 317 patient samples from three independent studies and assessed relations between methylation and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In an initial training cohort of 89 patients with MDS, methylation frequencies of individual genes ranged from 7% to 70% and were highly concordant. Therefore, we defined a methylation z score based on all genes for each patient. We found that patients with higher levels of methylation, compared with patients with lower levels, had a shorter median overall survival (12.3 v 17.5 months, respectively; P = .04) and shorter median progression-free survival (6.4 v 14.9 months, respectively; P = .009). This methylation prognostic model was independent of age, sex, and IPSS group. Applied to two validation cohorts (228 patients), this model was confirmed as an independent prognostic predictor for survival. Although methylation at baseline did not correlate with clinical response to decitabine, we observed a significant correlation between reduced methylation over time and clinical responses. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation predicts overall and progression-free survival in MDS.","['Shen, Lanlan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Guo, Yi', 'Lin, E', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Berry, Donald', 'Ahmed, Saira', 'Zhu, Wei', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Saba, Hussain', 'Estey, Eli', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Shen L', 'Kantarjian H', 'Guo Y', 'Lin E', 'Shan J', 'Huang X', 'Berry D', 'Ahmed S', 'Zhu W', 'Pierce S', 'Kondo Y', 'Oki Y', 'Jelinek J', 'Saba H', 'Estey E', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia and Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.

Interestingly, the ectopic expression of PLZF was shown to push conventional T cells into an activated state that seems to be proinflammatory. The factors that control the normal expression of PLZF in lymphocytes are unknown. In this study, we show that PLZF expression is not restricted to NK T cells but is also expressed by a subset of gammadelta T cells, functionally defining distinct subsets of this innate T cell population. A second BTB-ZF gene, ThPOK, is important for the phenotype of the PLZF-expressing gammadelta T cells. Most importantly, TCR signal strength and expression of inhibitor of differentiation gene 3 control the frequency of PLZF-expressing gammadelta T cells.

ABT-737, a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 mimetic (for structure, see Nature 435:677-681, 2005) inhibits the prosurvival function of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bcl-w. We show that ABT-737 was effective as a single agent against a panel of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts, previously established, from patient biopsies, in immunodeficient mice. Although in vitro resistance of leukemia cell lines correlated with expression of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1, there was no relationship between Mcl-1 expression and in vivo xenograft response to ABT-737. However, expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, and the extent of its association with Bcl-2, significantly correlated with in vivo ABT-737 sensitivity. ABT-737 potentiated the antileukemic effects of L-asparaginase, topotecan, vincristine, and etoposide against drug-resistant xenografts in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that the combination of L-asparaginase (by specifically down-regulating Mcl-1 protein levels), topotecan (by activating p53 via DNA damage), and ABT-737 (by inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members) caused profound synergistic antileukemic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Rational targeting of specific components of the apoptotic pathway may be a useful approach to improve the treatment of refractory or relapsed pediatric ALL.

Based on this observation, we previously identified a novel developmental pathway for the generation of CD4+ T cells via interactions between MHC class II-expressing thymocytes (thymocyte-thymocyte [T-T] interactions) with a transgenic mouse system. However, the developmental dissection of this T-T interaction in humans has not been possible because of the lack of known cellular molecules specific for T-T CD4+ T cells. We show that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is a useful marker for the identification of T-T CD4+ T cells. With this analysis, we determined that a substantial number of fetal thymocytes and splenocytes express PLZF and acquire innate characteristics during their development in humans. Although these characteristics are quite similar to invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, they clearly differ from iNKT cells in that they have a diverse T cell receptor repertoire and are restricted by MHC class II molecules. These findings define a novel human CD4+ T cell subset that develops via an MHC class II-dependent T-T interaction.","['Lee, You Jeong', 'Jeon, Yoon Kyung', 'Kang, Byung Hyun', 'Chung, Doo Hyun', 'Park, Chung-Gyu', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Jung, Kyeong Cheon', 'Park, Seong Hoe']","['Lee YJ', 'Jeon YK', 'Kang BH', 'Chung DH', 'Park CG', 'Shin HY', 'Jung KC', 'Park SH']","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Communication', 'Fetus/embryology/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/embryology/*immunology']",2009/12/30 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/12/30 06:00'],"['2009/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20091519 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20091519 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2010 Jan 18;207(1):237-46. doi: 10.1084/jem.20091519.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative proteomics was used to screen multidrug resistance-related proteins from K562 and K562/A02; the differently expressed proteins were further confirmed by western blot and real-time PCR. short hairpin RNA (shRNA) assay was applied to determine the relationship between candidate protein and adriamycin resistance. Bisulfite sequencing was carried out to assess methylation status of candidate multidrug resistance-related gene promoter. K562/A02 was treated with 5-azacytidine or trichostatin A (TSA); multidrug resistance phenotype and corresponding protein or gene changes were detected. RESULTS: Seventeen proteins with altered abundances of more than twofold were detected, among which mitochondrial ATPase in K562/A02 was significantly down-regulated. Suppressing mitochondrial ATPase by shRNA could enhance adriamycin resistance and antiapoptosis activity of K562. The promoter hypermethylation in mitochondrial ATPase was found to be attributed to the adriamycin-resistant phenotype of both K562/A02 (methylated frequency 18.18%) and CML primary cells in accelerated phase (methylated frequency 7.95%) or blast crisis (methylated frequency 26.59%). Inhibition of hypermethylation increased adriamycin sensitivity of K562/A02. A synergistic effect on reversing adriamycin-resistant phenotype was obtained when 5-azacytidine was combined with TSA. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of mitochondrial ATPase can lead to adriamycin resistance in CML and the mechanism is associated with DNA methylation regulation.","['Li, R J', 'Zhang, G S', 'Chen, Y H', 'Zhu, J F', 'Lu, Q J', 'Gong, F J', 'Kuang, W Y']","['Li RJ', 'Zhang GS', 'Chen YH', 'Zhu JF', 'Lu QJ', 'Gong FJ', 'Kuang WY']","['Department of Hematology/Institute of Molecular Hematology, Second Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology/Institute of Molecular Hematology, Second Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.

However, resistance and intolerance to imatinib have emerged as substantial clinical issues. The mechanisms underlying resistance are multifactorial and may include mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL, increased production of BCR-ABL, or activation of BCR-ABL-independent pathways. Two second-line BCR-ABL inhibitors are now approved for treatment of patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib. Dasatinib is a dual BCR-ABL/Src-family kinase (SFK) inhibitor approved for patients with imatinib-resistant and -intolerant CML in any phase and Ph+ ALL. Nilotinib, an analogue of imatinib, is approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients with chronic or accelerated phase CML. Both agents have shown significant clinical activity in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and their approval represents a major advancement in the treatment options available. Choosing the most appropriate treatment after imatinib failure may be critical in attaining the best possible long-term prognosis.

The findings were diagnostic of myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in accordance with the World Health Organization criteria modified for pediatric age group. Fundus examination revealed a sickle-shaped hanging retinal mass of right eye. Biopsy/aspiration cytology of the retinal mass was not done in this case owing to risk of severe bleeding, a common feature in any hematologic malignancy. The child had been included in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia trials as the parents were not ready for stem cell transplantation, but he died after 3 months due to overwhelming infection.

No significant differences in the serum TF and TFPI levels were found in allo-HSCT recipients in the absence of aGVHD or with grade I aGVHD before and after the transplantation. The levels of serum TF and TFPI were substantially increased in the patients with gradeII aGVHD at the peak of aGVHD (P<0.05) and they were even higher in the patients with grade III-IV aGVHD (P<0.01). When the conditions became stable after treatment with immunosuppressive agents, the serum TFPI level was decreased to the baseline level (P>0.05) and the TF level was lowered but still higher than the baseline level (P<0.05). It was concluded that the levels of serum TF and TFPI were increased significantly in the patients with grade II-IV aGVHD after allo-HSCT and decreased markedly after the treatment.

The standardized incidence ratio of childhood leukemia for the seven municipalities in the vicinity of NPPs was 1.0 (95% CI 0.6, 1.6) compared to the rest of Finland. The two cohorts defined by censuses of 1980 and 1990 gave rate ratios of 1.0 (95% CI 0.3, 2.6) and 0.9 (95% CI 0.2, 2.7), respectively, for childhood leukemia in the population residing within 15 km from the NPPs compared to the 15-50 km zone. The case-control analysis with 16 cases of childhood leukemia and 64 matched population-based controls gave an odds ratio for average distance between residence and NPP in the closest 5-9.9 km zone of 0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 10.4) compared to > or =30 km zone.

Why is it that once an IBD develops it lasts a long time? Considering this simple question, we propose that coliotogenic memory CD4+T cells that remember the prototype of the disease in each patient are formed in IBD at the onset, and, perceiving them as ""benign T-cell leukemia""-like lifelong memory CD4+T cells that hematogenously spread throughout the body, we thus propose that systemic circulating colitogenic memory CD4+T cells would be an ideal target for the treatment of IBD. Accordingly, selective depletion of colitogenic memory CD4+T cells by leukocytapheresis and blockade of circulation of colitogenic memory CD4+T cells by a newly developed immunosuppressant, FTY720, may be associated with dramatic efficacy and a marked reduction of inflammatory cytokines produced by activated leucocytes. We here describe the immunological pathogenesis focusing on the generation of circulating colitogenic memory CD4+T cells and the possible logics of leukocytapheresis and FTY720 for the treatment of IBD.","['Kanai, Takanori', 'Watanabe, Mamoru', 'Hibi, Toshifumi']","['Kanai T', 'Watanabe M', 'Hibi T']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjyuku, Tokyo, Japan. takagast@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Keio J Med,The Keio journal of medicine,0376354,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Colon/immunology', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/drug effects/immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy/*immunology', '*Leukapheresis', 'Propylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2302/kjm.58.203 [doi]'],ppublish,Keio J Med. 2009 Dec;58(4):203-9. doi: 10.2302/kjm.58.203.,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, due to lack of Indian data, we aimed at the development and validation of these tests in Indian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular assays were used for identifying TPMT/DPD variations; validated by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Molecular assays have been used for screening TPMT*2, *3A, *3B, *3C alleles and IVS14+1(G-->A) in DPD gene. A patient, exhibiting neutropenia on 6-MP was observed to be G460A-homozygote, while, two Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients with side-effects exhibited wild-type alleles. Two patients showing 6-MP side-effects and responding well to the same drug at later stage also carried wild-type alleles. DISCUSSION: G460A homozygosity in a patient allowed clinicians to stop 6-MP treatment, improving patient's health status. Two ALL patients showing side-effects were wild-type, indicating presence of unidentified rare variations. Two patients with wild-type allele showed side-effects during 6-MP treatment, but responded well to same drug at later stage, suggesting side-effects to be attributable to multiple biological and environmental processes.

Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), an important physiological immunomodulator, possesses direct cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on tumour cells, antiangiogenic effects, and activates anti-tumour immunity. Recently, the IFN-alpha oncologic indications have included melanoma, renal carcinoma, and different types of leukaemia. However, the application of IFN-alpha in therapy of lung cancer has not been validated yet. Herein the human lung carcinoma cell line A549, a model of NSCLC in vitro, was used to pursue the effect of IFN-alpha on A549 cell proliferation and differentiation together with the effect on protein expression and activity of three ATP-transporters mediating multi-drug resistance (MDR). IFN-alpha significantly inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells which was not connected with arrest in a particular cell cycle phase. Further, IFN-alpha-mediated differentiation of A549 was observed based on an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. Simultaneously, IFN-alpha increased the expression and activity of ATP-transporters mediating MDR. Thus, the IFN-alpha down-regulation of NSCLC cell proliferation was accompanied by a potential of cells to exclude potential therapeutic substances such as chemotherapeutic agents. These effects could have a significant impact on considerations of IFN-alpha as a therapeutic agent for NSCLC.","['Krejcova, Daniela', 'Prochazkova, Jirina', 'Kubala, Lukas', 'Pachernik, Jiri']","['Krejcova D', 'Prochazkova J', 'Kubala L', 'Pachernik J']","['Institute of Biophysics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/enzymology/*physiopathology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/*physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/gpb_2009_03_294 [doi]'],ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2009 Sep;28(3):294-301. doi: 10.4149/gpb_2009_03_294.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karst.; Ganodermataceae Donk] on NB4 human leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two aqueous extracts and a methanol-extracted column-chromatography semipurified fraction were obtained from Ganoderma lucidum fruiting body. Flow cytometry analyses were used to measure cell viability, cell cycle and DNA fragmentation and to quantify apoptosis. Western-blot analyses were used to quantify changes in apoptosis proteins and intracellular kinases. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts slightly reduce cell viability and induce DNA fragmentation in NB4 cells. Methanol-extracted semipurified fraction at dilutions down to 15% or 40% of the initial fraction concentration reduced significantly the viability of these leukemia cells (treated for 19h) with induction of DNA fragmentation and induction of apoptosis. Overmore, the dilution down to 15% of the initial E3 concentration induced a reduction of p53 levels, of the Bcl2/Bax relationship as well as reduced levels of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Akt (Protein kinase Akt, protein kinase B) and Erk (Erk1 and 2). CONCLUSIONS: Induction of apoptosis and alterations in signal transduction kinases (Akt and Erk) are produced by active fractions from Ganoderma lucidum on human leukemia cells. These data could be of important relevance from the viewpoint of antitumor actions of compounds from Ganoderma lucidum. Eventual therapy applications in leukemia cells might be developed.","['Calvino, Eva', 'Manjon, Jose Luis', 'Sancho, Pilar', 'Tejedor, M Cristina', 'Herraez, Angel', 'Diez, Jose C']","['Calvino E', 'Manjon JL', 'Sancho P', 'Tejedor MC', 'Herraez A', 'Diez JC']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, 28871 Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Reishi/*chemistry']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/06/19 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(09)00782-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2009.12.027 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2010 Mar 2;128(1):71-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2009.12.027.

METHODS: We cloned the human C20orf 116 and defined its transcript in liver, kidney and various brain regions by Northern analysis. Antibodies against recombinant protein used for immunofluorescence and immunoblots confirmed its expression in these tissues. With the focus on kidney, its tubular expression and presence in glomerula were shown. RESULTS: A 28 aa long signal peptide predicted by in silico analysis is reflected by visualization of size variants of approximately 3kDa difference suggesting a signal peptidase cleavage of the proform. Cell compartment separation confirmed the presence of Dashurin in peroxisomes/mitochondria, microsomes, cytosol and nucleus. This is in line with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Dashurin fusion protein shuttling between cytosol and nucleus. Luciferase reporter studies revealed a 2-3 fold increase of promoter activities upon over-expression. Bioinformatic analysis identified a PCI-domain at the C-terminus providing protein-protein interaction capabilities. CONCLUSION: Our present findings suggest the involvement of Dashurin in gene transcription or mRNA translation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dashurin shares the PCI-domain with three multisubunit protein complexes (26S proteasome, COP9 signalosome and eIF3 translation initiation factor).","['Neziri, D', 'Ilhan, A', 'Maj, M', 'Majdic, O', 'Baumgartner-Parzer, S', 'Cohen, G', 'Base, W', 'Wagner, L']","['Neziri D', 'Ilhan A', 'Maj M', 'Majdic O', 'Baumgartner-Parzer S', 'Cohen G', 'Base W', 'Wagner L']","['Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Department of Internal Medicine III, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DDRGK1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', '*Genome, Human', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics', 'Luciferases/genetics', '*Open Reading Frames', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/06/11 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(09)00339-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Apr;1800(4):430-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.12.004.

To analyze benzene-caused aberrant gene expression, we examined differential gene expression by microarray analysis of peripheral mononuclear blood cells from seven workers diagnosed with benzene poisoning and seven matched controls. Twenty-two genes were found up-regulated and 18 down-regulated in benzene patients compared with controls. Here we report the characterization of two benzene-regulated genes. CYP4F3A, which encodes the leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) omega-hydroxylase, is important for inactivation of LTB(4) in neutrophils. CYP4F3A mRNA was found elevated in all patients; moreover, CYP4F3A mRNA and protein were induced by benzene metabolite phenol in HL-60 and K562 cells as well as ex vivo in human peripheral neutrophils. Silencing of CYP4F3A in HL-60 cells by lentiviral delivery of CYP4F3A-specific siRNA reduced cell survival to 56%, 44%, 22%, 14%, and 3% at 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days, respectively; the results suggest that CYP4F3A is a critical positive regulator of HL-60 proliferation. DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) regulates non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. DNA-PKcs mRNA was found consistently increased in the patients and DNA-PKcs mRNA and protein were induced by hydroquinone in HL-60 cells. In a DSB model, hydroquinone induced the formation of gamma-H2AX foci, a marker of DSBs, in HL-60 cells. The findings indicate that hydroquinone induces DSBs and induction correlates with elevated levels of DNA-PKcs and NHEJ. Similar results were obtained in K562 cells treated with phenol. Since NHEJ is error-prone, induction of DNA-PKcs and NHEJ may contribute to mutagenesis and leukemia by benzene. To our knowledge, the study demonstrated for the first time that benzene and metabolites induce CYP4F3A and DNA-PKcs both in vivo and in vitro. Induction of the genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of benzene hematotoxicity and serve as biomarkers of benzene exposure.","['Bi, Yongyi', 'Li, Yuhong', 'Kong, Mengmeng', 'Xiao, Xiao', 'Zhao, Zhiwei', 'He, Xiaoqing', 'Ma, Qiang']","['Bi Y', 'Li Y', 'Kong M', 'Xiao X', 'Zhao Z', 'He X', 'Ma Q']","['School of Public Health, Wuhan University, 185 Donghu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China. yongyib@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 4)', 'EC 1.14.14.94 (CYP4F3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 4', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00569-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):207-11. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.024.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of LIF and its receptor (LIFR) in the canine pituitary gland and in corticotrope adenomas, and to perform a mutation analysis of LIFR. Using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and quantitative expression analysis, LIF and LIFR expression were studied in pituitary glands of control dogs and in specimens of corticotrope adenoma tissue collected through hypophysectomy in dogs with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH, Cushing's disease). Using sequence analysis, cDNA was screened for mutations in the LIFR. In the control pituitary tissues and corticotrope adenomas, there was a low magnitude of LIF expression. The LIFR, however, was highly expressed and co-localized with ACTH(1-24) expression. Cytoplasmatic immunoreactivity of LIFR was preserved in corticotrope adenomas and adjacent nontumorous cells of pars intermedia. No mutation was found on mutation analysis of the complete LIFR cDNA. Surprisingly, nuclear to perinuclear immunoreactivity for LIFR was present in nontumorous pituitary cells of the pars distalis in 10 of 12 tissue specimens from PDH dogs. These data show that LIFR is highly co-expressed with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in the canine pituitary gland and in corticotrope adenomas.

Synthetic oviduct fluid (SOF) was used as the culture medium. We studied the development of bovine embryos produced in vitro and cultured until Day 9 after fertilization. TGF-beta1, bFGF, GM-CSF, and LIF used on their own significantly improved the yield of hatched blastocysts. IGF-I, bFGF, TGF-beta1, GM-CSF, and LIF significantly accelerated embryonic development, especially the change from the expanded blastocyst to hatched blastocyst stages. Use of a combination of these growth factors and cytokines (GF-CYK) in SOF medium produced higher percentages of blastocysts and hatched blastocysts than did use of SOF alone (45% and 22% vs. 24% and 12%; P<0.05) on Day 8 after in vitro fertilization and similar results to use of SOF+10% fetal calf serum (38% and 16%, at the same stages, respectively). The averages of total cells, inner cell mass cells, and trophectoderm cells of exclusively in vitro Day-8 blastocysts for pooled GF-CYK treatments were higher than those for SOF and similar to those for fetal calf serum. The presence of these growth factors and cytokines in the embryo culture medium therefore has a combined stimulatory action on embryonic development; in particular through an increase in hatching rate and in the number of cells of both the inner cell mass and trophoblast. These results are the first to demonstrate that use of a combination of recombinant growth factors and cytokine, as IGF-I, IGF-II, bFGF, TGF-beta1, LIF, and GM-CSF, produces similar results to 10% fetal calf serum for the development of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. This entirely synthetic method of embryo culture has undeniable advantages for the biosecurity of embryo transfer.","['Neira, J A', 'Tainturier, D', 'Pena, M A', 'Martal, J']","['Neira JA', 'Tainturier D', 'Pena MA', 'Martal J']","['Laboratoire de Pathologie de la Reproduction et Biotechnologie animale, Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Theriogenology,Theriogenology,0421510,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryonic Development/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2008/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-691X(09)00490-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Theriogenology. 2010 Mar 15;73(5):595-604. doi: 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.10.015.

Expression of the CXCR4 receptor in FLT3-ITD-positive AML is correlated with poor outcome, and inhibition of CXCR4 was shown to sensitize AML blasts toward chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of FLT3-ITD on cell proliferation and CXCR4-dependent migration in human hematopoietic progenitor cells and to investigate their response to CXCR4 inhibition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used primary blasts from patients with FLT3-ITD or FLT3 wild-type AML. In addition, human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells were transduced to >70% with retroviral vectors containing human FLT3-ITD. RESULTS: We found that FLT3-ITD transgene overexpressing human hematopoietic progenitor cells show strongly reduced migration toward stromal-derived factor-1 in vitro and display significantly reduced bone marrow homing in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice. Cocultivation of FLT3-ITD-positive AML blasts or hematopoietic progenitor cells on bone marrow stromal cells resulted in a strong proliferation advantage and increased early cobblestone area-forming cells compared to FLT3-wild-type AML blasts. Addition of the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 to the coculture significantly reduced both cobblestone area-forming cells and proliferation of FLT3-ITD-positive cells, but did not affect FLT3-wild-type cells-highlighting the critical interaction between CXCR4 and FLT3-ITD. CONCLUSION: CXCR4 inhibition to decrease cell proliferation and to control the leukemic burden may provide a novel therapeutic strategy in patients with advanced FLT3-ITD-positive AML.","['Jacobi, Angela', 'Thieme, Sebastian', 'Lehmann, Romy', 'Ugarte, Fernando', 'Malech, Harry L', 'Koch, Sina', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Muller, Katrin', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ryser, Martin', 'Brenner, Sebastian']","['Jacobi A', 'Thieme S', 'Lehmann R', 'Ugarte F', 'Malech HL', 'Koch S', 'Thiede C', 'Muller K', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ryser M', 'Brenner S']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclams', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00460-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Mar;38(3):180-90. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.12.003.

Because benzene is a known cause of human acute myelogenous leukemia there has been little reason for organizations such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) or the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) to perform standard hazard identification reviews of benzene as a possible cause of other cancers such as lymphomas. Increased understanding of underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis, as is reflected in the greater scope given to mechanistic evidence in assigning overall sufficiency of evidence for carcinogenicity by both IARC and NTP, suggests that the evidence supporting benzene as a cause of lymphoma likely has passed the threshold required for being listed as a known causal relationship. A broad range of genotoxic effects in the lymphocytes of benzene-exposed workers has been well documented, as has the role of chromosomal effects in carcinogenesis. There is also increasing evidence of a close relationship between lymphoid tumors and the types of myeloid tumors known to be caused by benzene. This includes the not infrequent finding of biphenotypic lineage as well as the formation of lymphoid as well as myeloid leukemias following chemotherapy. Studies of the mechanism of benzene toxicity are consistent with a relatively non-specific mechanism capable of producing multiple chromosomal changes, and there is evidence that the early hematopoietic stem cell, which is believed to be targeted by benzene in causing myeloid cancers, is also the progenitor of lymphocytic cell types. Furthermore, the classification of lymphomas has evolved so that non-Hodgkin lymphoma now includes such formerly distinct disorders as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, and there is less of a distinction between leukemia and non-leukemia forms of lymphoma.","['Goldstein, Bernard D']",['Goldstein BD'],"['Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, 130 Desoto Street, Crabtree A710, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. bdgold@pitt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/classification/epidemiology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Mice']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00566-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):147-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.021.

Its studies on the molecular basis of IgG interaction with the receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcgRs) has made it possible to develop antibodies with high antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity and enhanced affinity to FcgRIII (CD16), both correlated to a glycosylation pattern characterized by a low fucose content. Based on these studies, LFB has developed EMABling, a technological platform for the production of antibodies with enhanced cytotoxicity ability. Two EMABling antibodies recently entered clinical development: LFB-R593, a fully human anti-rhesus D (RhD) antibody, for the prevention of feto-maternal allo-immunization in RhD- women, as a substitute for human polyclonal anti-RhD immunoglobulins, and LFB-R603, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, for the treatment of B cell malignancies. LFB investment in bioproduction through the recent acquisition of MAbgene company, a fully integrated French contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing company, allows the production of antibodies to a large GMP scale.

They are classically used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment. The concept of coupling a cytotoxic agent to an antibody can be viewed as a means to confer a selectivity for tumoral cells to highly cytotoxic drugs which cannot be used in human, or a higher power to antibodies which have a low anti-tumoral activity on their own. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is the only drug-armed antibody available on the market, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Other immunoconjugates are currently under clinical development.

Today, we know that the efficacy of an immunoconjugate depends not only on the coupled cytotoxic agent, but also on the selected target, the coupling method and the linker.","['Haeuw, Jean-Francois', 'Caussanel, Veronique', 'Beck, Alain']","['Haeuw JF', 'Caussanel V', 'Beck A']","[""Centre d'immunologie Pierre Fabre, 5, avenue Napoleon III, BP 60497, 74160 Saint-Julien-en-Genevois, France. jean.francois.haeuw@ pierre-fabre.com""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,"['0 (Aminobenzoates)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (auristatin)', '14083FR882 (Maytansine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminobenzoates/administration & dosage/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Aminoglycosides/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Design', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Maytansine/administration & dosage/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/12/29 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2009/12/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['00/00/0E/9E/ [pii]', '10.1051/medsci/200925121046 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2009 Dec;25(12):1046-52. doi: 10.1051/medsci/200925121046.,10.1051/medsci/200925121046 [doi],,22,,,,,,"Les immunoconjugues, anticorps << armes >> pour combattre le cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A skin biopsy revealed invasion of APL cells. She was started on induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at 45 mg/m(2). On day 4, the leukemic cell number had increased to over 1.0 x 10(9)/L. Consequently, chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine was initiated. On day 10, dryness of the lips appeared. The lower lip swelled and developed painful black eschars. A high fever was also present. Despite discontinuing ATRA on day 20 and administering antibiotics, an anti-fungal agent and valaciclovir, these signs did not improve. Histopathologically, the biopsied lip revealed infiltration of neutrophils and vasculitis. The patient was given ATRA on days 29 and 30 due to an increase in APL cell numbers, after which the gangrenous cheilitis extended over the whole lip. On day 49, the patient was started on re-induction treatment with arsenic trioxide. She achieved complete remission and the gangrenous cheilitis slowly healed over the following 8 weeks. Since the clinical features of the gangrenous cheilitis in this case were similar to those of ATRA-associated scrotal ulcers, it appears that activated neutrophils derived from differentiated APL cells may have caused the gangrenous cheilitis. Physicians should be alert to the development of gangrenous cheilitis during treatment with ATRA.","['Tanaka, Mariko', 'Fukushima, Noriyasu', 'Itamura, Hidekazu', 'Urata, Chisako', 'Yokoo, Masako', 'Ide, Masaru', 'Hisatomi, Takashi', 'Tomimasu, Rika', 'Sueoka, Eisaburo', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Tanaka M', 'Fukushima N', 'Itamura H', 'Urata C', 'Yokoo M', 'Ide M', 'Hisatomi T', 'Tomimasu R', 'Sueoka E', 'Kimura S']","['Internal Medicine, Saga University, Nabeshima 5-1-1, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy', 'Cheilitis/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Gangrene/chemically induced/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2009/12/26 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/26 06:00'],"['2009/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-009-0468-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Jan;91(1):132-5. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0468-1.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) synergizes with the heat shock protein (HSP) 90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, to down-regulate STAT3 activity. However, both agents up-regulate HSP70, an anti-apoptotic protein. We therefore examined whether down-regulating HSP70 with short interference (si) RNA will affect ATO and 17-DMAG effects on constitutive STAT3 activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A semi-mechanistic pharmacodynamic model was used to characterize concentration-effect relationships of ATO and 17-DMAG effects on constitutive STAT3 activity and HSP70 expression with or without siRNA against HSP70 in a cell line model. RESULTS: Treatment with siRNA for HSP70 resulted in a stronger degree of synergism on down-regulation of STAT3 activity by ATO and 17-DMAG. However, treatment with siRNA for HSP70 resulted in less synergism on up-regulation of HSP70 by the two drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of HSP70 improves ATO and 17-DMAG effects on constitutive STAT3 activity. These results further provide a basis for studying the combined role of ATO with a HSP90 inhibitor such as 17-DMAG in AML with constitutive STAT3 activity.","['Ghoshal, Sampa', 'Rao, Indranil', 'Earp, Justin C', 'Jusko, William J', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Ghoshal S', 'Rao I', 'Earp JC', 'Jusko WJ', 'Wetzler M']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Leukemia Section, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. meir.wetzler@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electroporation', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",2009/12/26 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2009/12/26 06:00'],"['2009/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1210-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Sep;66(4):681-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1210-7.

The resulting fusion proteins, while retaining DNA binding activity, display loss of subnuclear targeting and associated transactivation functions encoded by the C-terminus of the protein. To define the precise contribution of the Runx1 C-terminus in development and leukemia, we created a knock-in mouse with a C-terminal truncation by introducing a single nucleic acid substitution in the native Runx1 locus. This mutation (Runx1(Q307X)) models genetic lesions observed in patients with leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders. The Runx1(Q307X) homozygous mouse exhibits embryonic lethality at E12.5 due to central nervous system hemorrhages and a complete lack of hematopoietic stem cell function. While able to bind DNA, Runx1(Q307X) is unable to activate target genes, resulting in deregulation of various hematopoietic markers. Thus, we demonstrate that the subnuclear targeting and transcriptional regulatory activities of the Runx1 C-terminus are critical for hematopoietic development. We propose that compromising the C-terminal functions of Runx1 is a common mechanism for the pathological consequences of a variety of somatic mutations and Runx1-related leukemic fusion proteins observed in human patients.","['Dowdy, Christopher R', 'Xie, Ronglin', 'Frederick, Dana', 'Hussain, Sadiq', 'Zaidi, Sayyed K', 'Vradii, Diana', 'Javed, Amjad', 'Li, Xiangen', 'Jones, Stephen N', 'Lian, Jane B', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S']","['Dowdy CR', 'Xie R', 'Frederick D', 'Hussain S', 'Zaidi SK', 'Vradii D', 'Javed A', 'Li X', 'Jones SN', 'Lian JB', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Embryo, Mammalian/abnormalities/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genotype', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",2009/12/26 06:00,2010/06/11 06:00,['2009/12/26 06:00'],"['2009/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['ddp568 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddp568 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2010 Mar 15;19(6):1048-57. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddp568.

Among the many more recently described biological activities of the indirubins, attention has been directed toward the ability of these compounds to inhibit GSK-3 and CDKs, kinases implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. Little information is available on effects of indirubins on chemically-induced neurodegeneration. Here we examined the influence of three indirubins on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)- and kainic acid (KA)-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse. The three indirubins examined were 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO), 5-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (5BIO) and 5-amino-6-bromoindirubin (5A6BI). The first two derivatives were previously described indirubins with low nanomolar inhibitory activity against GSK-3 and CDKs. The third compound was synthesized by the dimerization of 5-amino-6-bromoisatin with 3-acetoxyindol. The synthesis of the key compound 5-amino-6-bromoisatin was based on the bromination of the ketal of 5-amino-isatin. All indirubins examined decreased various measures associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission in striatum. These effects occurred alone or over and above the decrements seen following administration of the dopaminergic neurotoxicant, MPTP. Striatal serotonin and serotonin turnover were decreased by the indirubins in MPTP-treated mice. None of these striatal effects of the indirubins alone were associated with evidence of astrogliosis, an indicator of underlying neuropathology, nor did they potentiate the astrogliosis accompanying administration of MPTP. In general, the indirubins reduced KA-associated mortality and striatal but not hippocampal astrogliosis due to this toxicant. The data suggest that indirubins affect striatal biogenic amine levels and turnover in intact mice. The data do not indicate a neuroprotective action of indirubins in mice treated with MPTP but that they do suggest that they may be neuroprotective against KA-induced injury of the neostriatum.","['Magiatis, Prokopios', 'Polychronopoulos, Panagiotis', 'Skaltsounis, Alexios-Leandros', 'Lozach, Olivier', 'Meijer, Laurent', 'Miller, Diane B', ""O'Callaghan, James P""]","['Magiatis P', 'Polychronopoulos P', 'Skaltsounis AL', 'Lozach O', 'Meijer L', 'Miller DB', ""O'Callaghan JP""]","['Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis Zografou, GR-15771 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neurotoxicol Teratol,Neurotoxicology and teratology,8709538,"[""0 (6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime)"", '0 (Biogenic Monoamines)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '0 (Oximes)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Basal Ganglia Diseases/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Biogenic Monoamines/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Corpus Striatum/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dopamine/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gliosis/chemically induced/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Indoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neurotoxins/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Oximes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Parkinsonian Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/26 06:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/12/26 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0892-0362(09)00223-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ntt.2009.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurotoxicol Teratol. 2010 Mar-Apr;32(2):212-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ntt.2009.12.005.

Gomisin N, but not gomisin A, inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis. The increase in apoptosis that was induced by gomisin N was correlated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Furthermore, gomisin N induced the proteolytic activation of caspase-9 and -3 and a concomitant degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.

Inhibition of topoisomerase II (topoII) by benzene and its metabolites represents a potential mechanism by which benzene could induce its chromosome-altering and leukemogenic effects. Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that bioactive benzene metabolites are capable of inhibiting topoII in isolated enzyme and cell culture systems. Similarly, a decrease in topoII activity has been seen in the bone marrow of mice administered benzene in vivo. The objective of these studies was to further investigate the mechanisms by which the bioactivated benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (BAHQ), inhibits topoII in vitro, and to identify the point(s) in the enzyme's catalytic cycle where inhibition occurs. Our experiments indicate that BAHQ inhibits topoII at the DNA binding stage as well as in the closed clamp stage in the catalytic cycle, thereby interfering with either the binding to, or the release of, DNA from the enzyme. While increases in the cleavable complex were also seen with BAHQ treatment, our results suggest that this is related to a shift in equilibrium due to an accumulation of the topoII enzyme at the closed clamp stage rather than a major inhibitory effect on the religation step. An increase in cleavable complex formation as well as the inhibition of enzymatic activity at the closed clamp and other stages of the catalytic cycle in bone marrow cells would likely result in DNA breakage, the formation of chromosomal aberrations, and could potentially result in leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations, similar to those seen in leukemias induced by the bisdioxopiperazine type of catalytic topoII inhibitors.","['Mondrala, Scott', 'Eastmond, David A']","['Mondrala S', 'Eastmond DA']","['Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program and Department of Cell Biology & Neuroscience, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2009/12/26 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/26 06:00'],"['2009/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00568-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):259-68. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.023.

A correlation between low incidence of apoptosis in cumulus cells and oocyte maturation has previously been suggested in ovarian stimulation. However, little is known in unprimed ovaries. These authors have investigated whether BAX and BCL2 expression in cumulus cells affects the competency of in-vitro matured oocytes. We have studied 100 cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COC) recovered from unprimed ovaries of 13 women diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and undergoing in-vitro maturation (IVM) with their informed consent. COC were matured for 24 h in a specific maturation medium and the cumulus was stripped from the oocyte. BAX and BCL2 mRNA content was measured in each COC using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that BCL2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in cumulus cells associated with mature oocytes than those associated with immature oocytes while BAX mRNA concentrations did not vary in cumulus cells. Regarding fertilization, higher BCL2 mRNA content was found in cumulus cells enclosing fertilized oocytes (0.140 versus 0.075; P = 0.03). These results suggest that BCL2 expression is strongly associated with the ability of oocytes to complete nuclear maturation and to be fertilized.","['Filali, M', 'Frydman, N', 'Belot, M P', 'Hesters, L', 'Gaudin, F', 'Tachdjian, G', 'Emilie, D', 'Frydman, R', 'Machelon, V']","['Filali M', 'Frydman N', 'Belot MP', 'Hesters L', 'Gaudin F', 'Tachdjian G', 'Emilie D', 'Frydman R', 'Machelon V']","[""APHP, Service d'Histologie Embryologie Cytogenetique, Hopital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, F-92140, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Reprod Biomed Online,Reproductive biomedicine online,101122473,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cumulus Cells/*chemistry/physiology', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oocytes/*growth & development', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']",2010/02/06 06:00,2010/05/11 06:00,['2009/12/26 06:00'],"['2009/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['S1472-6483(10)61071-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Reprod Biomed Online. 2009;19 Suppl 4:4309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the process of constructing the HTLV-1 provirus by overlapping PCR, we also constructed an incomplete molecular clone, in which the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) was replaced with the endogenous human gene, which resulted in the expression of a tax gene shorter by 43 bp. This incomplete molecular clone alone expressed Tax and produced the viral protein in transfected cells. Various clones were then constructed with different lengths of the 3' LTR and lacking the reverse-direction TATA box. The clones contained over 113 bp of the 3' LTR, with no reverse-direction TATA box, which might express the full-length tax gene, and did not produce the viral antigen.

Recent studies show that the event-free survival after HSCT is between 24 and 54%, with no difference between transplants using matched family donors and those using unrelated donors. The use of therapies such as intensive chemotherapy and splenectomy prior to HSCT does not improve the outcome. The relapse rate following HSCT is over 30%, which is unacceptably high.

However, no studies concerning biological activity of the plant extracts have been done so far. In the present study, the anti-leukemic activity of the methanol extract of aerial parts (ME) of C. acutangulus has been investigated, and efforts have been made to identify the active ingredient responsible for this activity. METHODS: The anti-leukemic activity of ME, its fractions and corchorusin-D (COR-D), the active ingredient, was investigated in leukemic cell lines U937 and HL-60 using cell viability and MTT assays. The molecular pathways leading to the activity of COR-D were examined by confocal microscopy, flow-cytometry, caspase and Western blot assays. RESULTS: ME, its n-butanolic fraction and COR-D inhibited cell growth and produced significant cytotoxicity in leukemic cell lines U937 and HL-60. COR-D produced apoptotic cell death via mitochondrial disfunction and was found to pursue the intrinsic pathway by inciting the release of apoptosis-inducing factors (AIFs) from mitochondria. COR-D-induced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria facilitating caspase-9 activation and up regulation of downstream pathways leading to caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, which resulted in the subsequent accumulation of cells in the sub-G0 phase followed by DNA fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: COR-D possesses significant anti-leukemic activity in U937 and HL-60 cell lines by acting on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Since the necrotic body formation is low after COR-D treatment, the occurrence of inflammation in in vivo systems could be reduced, which represents a positive indication in view of therapeutic application.","['Mallick, Sumana', 'Ghosh, Papiya', 'Samanta, Suman K', 'Kinra, Sumita', 'Pal, Bikas C', 'Gomes, Aparna', 'Vedasiromoni, Joseph R']","['Mallick S', 'Ghosh P', 'Samanta SK', 'Kinra S', 'Pal BC', 'Gomes A', 'Vedasiromoni JR']","['Drug Development Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology [Unit of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, India], 4 Raja S.C.

A total of 27 elements were determined for each region. Considering that an efficient variable selection can be highly beneficial both to improve the predictive ability of the model and to greatly reduce its complexity, genetic algorithm-partial least squares was used to screen out 13 qualified elements. As a result, only 13 elements, i.e., As, Hg, Mn, Sr, Ba, Cu, Ti, Co, K, Ca, Rb, Zn, and Mg, were picked out and, a partial least squares model with three latent variables was obtained, whose prediction exhibited a correlative coefficient of 0.874 with actual mortality. Especially, it showed a high negative correlation between the content of soil As and the mortality of leukemia. Such a fact can be explained by the apoptotic effect of cancerous cells by trace-amount arsenic trioxide. Furthermore, according to whether the mortality was larger than two out of 100,000 (2 x 10(-)(5)), all the 29 regions were divided into 21 high-mortality regions and eight low-mortality regions and were assigned the label -1 or 1, respectively. Using the same 13 elements, a Fisher's discriminant analysis model was developed, which can successfully discriminate low- and high-mortality groups.","['Tan, Chao', 'Chen, Hui', 'Xia, Chengyun']","['Tan C', 'Chen H', 'Xia C']","[""Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yibin University, People's Republic of China. chaotan1112@163.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Soil)', '0 (Trace Elements)']",IM,"['China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Soil/*analysis', 'Trace Elements/*analysis/metabolism']",2009/12/25 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12011-009-8582-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2010 Dec;137(3):289-300. doi: 10.1007/s12011-009-8582-8.

To test whether mESCs have the potential to differentiate into trophoblast, we assessed the effect of BMP4 on mESCs in a defined monolayer culture condition. The expression of trophoblast-specific transcription factors such as Cdx2, Dlx3, Esx1, Gata3, Hand1, Mash2, and Plx1 was specifically upregulated in the BMP4-treated differentiated cells, and these cells expressed trophoblast markers. These results suggest that BMP4 treatment in defined culture conditions enabled mESCs to differentiate into trophoblast. This differentiation was inhibited by serum or leukemia inhibitory factor, which are generally used for mESC culture. In addition, we studied the mechanism underlying BMP4-directed mESC differentiation into trophoblast. Our results showed that BMP4 activates the Smad pathway in mESCs inducing Cdx2 expression, which plays a crucial role in trophoblast differentiation, through the binding of Smad protein to the Cdx2 genomic enhancer sequence. Our findings imply that there is a common molecular mechanism underlying hESC and mESC differentiation into trophoblast.","['Hayashi, Yohei', 'Furue, Miho Kusuda', 'Tanaka, Satoshi', 'Hirose, Michiko', 'Wakisaka, Noriko', 'Danno, Hiroki', 'Ohnuma, Kiyoshi', 'Oeda, Shiho', 'Aihara, Yuko', 'Shiota, Kunio', 'Ogura, Atsuo', 'Ishiura, Shoichi', 'Asashima, Makoto']","['Hayashi Y', 'Furue MK', 'Tanaka S', 'Hirose M', 'Wakisaka N', 'Danno H', 'Ohnuma K', 'Oeda S', 'Aihara Y', 'Shiota K', 'Ogura A', 'Ishiura S', 'Asashima M']","['Department of Life Sciences (Biology), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 153-8902, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Yet, data have established that high-dose MTX (HDMTX) hampers the accumulation of 6-TGN in red blood cells (RBC) and lymphoblasts. METHODS: To clarify the pharmacokinetic interactions between these two antimetabolites, we serially measured RBC 6-TGN and MTX polyglutamates (MTXPG) levels following repeated courses of HDMTX (5 g/m(2) over 24 h) with daily oral 6-MP (25 mg/m(2)) during interval therapy in 20 children with ALL. RESULTS: HDMTX produced a rapid reduction in RBC 6-TGN 24 h after the start of MTX, and this effect was sustained at least by the third day (median decrease -21%; P < 0.001). However, a return to pre-infusion of 6-TGN levels was observed by the time of the following HDMTX course 14 days later (P < 0.001). RBC MTX polyglutamates accumulation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics but was not associated with the change in pre-infusion 6-TGN levels which remained stable during the interval period. CONCLUSION: HDMTX does not appear to enhance 6-MP activation to 6-TGN. Moreover, given that the deleterious effect of HDMTX on intracellular 6-MP disposition has been shown to be several folds greater in lymphoblasts than in RBC. Our data warrant additional studies elucidating the optimal MTX dose synergizing with 6-MP.","['Adam de Beaumais, T', 'Dervieux, T', 'Fakhoury, M', 'Medard, Y', 'Azougagh, S', 'Zhang, D', 'Yakouben, K', 'Jacqz-Aigrain, E']","['Adam de Beaumais T', 'Dervieux T', 'Fakhoury M', 'Medard Y', 'Azougagh S', 'Zhang D', 'Yakouben K', 'Jacqz-Aigrain E']","['Department of Pediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Robert Debre Hospital, 48 Boulevard Serurier, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Interactions', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/physiology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/metabolism']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1205-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Sep;66(4):653-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1205-4.

As part of a prospective randomized phase III study, directly comparing the use of CD3(+)/CD19(+)-depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests with CD34(+)-selected PBSC harvests in allogeneic human leukocyte antigen-matched SCT, we here show that the use of CD3(+)/CD19(+)-depleted PBSC grafts leads to early NK cell repopulation and reconstitution of the CD56(dim) and CD56(bright) NK cell subsets, with concomitant high cytolytic capacity. In the CD34 group, this process took significantly longer. Moreover, in the CD3/19 group after reconstitution, a higher percentage of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-positive NK cells was found. Although similar percentages of CD94-positive NK cells were found in both groups, in the CD34 group, almost all expressed the inhibitory CD94:NKG2A complex, whereas in the CD3/19 group, the inhibitory CD94:NKG2A and the activating CD94:NKG2C complex were equally distributed. This preferential development of NKG2C-expressing NK cells in the CD3/19 group was paralleled by a loss of NKG2A-mediated inhibition of NK cell degranulation. These results show that the use of CD3(+)/CD19(+)-depleted grafts facilitates strong NK cell cytolytic responses directly after SCT, and the rapid emergence of an NK cell receptor phenotype that is more prone to activation.","['Eissens, D N', 'Schaap, N P M', 'Preijers, F W M B', 'Dolstra, H', 'van Cranenbroek, B', 'Schattenberg, A V M', 'Joosten, I', 'van der Meer, A']","['Eissens DN', 'Schaap NP', 'Preijers FW', 'Dolstra H', 'van Cranenbroek B', 'Schattenberg AV', 'Joosten I', 'van der Meer A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/*physiology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/analysis', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009269 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.269 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):583-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.269.

The panel summarized the current state of MRD diagnostics in ALL and developed recommendations on the minimal technical requirements that should be fulfilled before implementation of MRD diagnostics into clinical trials.

The proposed MRD terminology may allow a refined and standardized assessment of response to treatment in adult and childhood ALL, and provides a sound basis for the comparison of MRD results between different treatment protocols.","['Bruggemann, M', 'Schrauder, A', 'Raff, T', 'Pfeifer, H', 'Dworzak, M', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Asnafi, V', 'Baruchel, A', 'Bassan, R', 'Benoit, Y', 'Biondi, A', 'Cave, H', 'Dombret, H', 'Fielding, A K', 'Foa, R', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Goulden, N', 'Henze, G', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Macintyre, E A', 'Pieters, R', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Ribera, J-M', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Spinelli, O', 'Stary, J', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Kneba, M', 'Schrappe, M', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['Bruggemann M', 'Schrauder A', 'Raff T', 'Pfeifer H', 'Dworzak M', 'Ottmann OG', 'Asnafi V', 'Baruchel A', 'Bassan R', 'Benoit Y', 'Biondi A', 'Cave H', 'Dombret H', 'Fielding AK', 'Foa R', 'Gokbuget N', 'Goldstone AH', 'Goulden N', 'Henze G', 'Hoelzer D', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Macintyre EA', 'Pieters R', 'Rambaldi A', 'Ribera JM', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Spinelli O', 'Stary J', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Kneba M', 'Schrappe M', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany. m.brueggemann@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009268 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.268 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):521-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.268.

In this work, we explored whether CC is involved in mobilization of HSPCs induced by the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. To address this question, we performed mobilization studies in mice that display a defect in the activation of the proximal steps of CC (Rag(-/-), severe combined immune deficient (SCID), C2.Cfb(-/-)) as well as in mice that do not activate the distal steps of CC (C5(-/-)). We noticed that proximal CC activation-deficient mice (above C5 level), in contrast to distal step CC activation-deficient C5(-/-) ones, mobilize normally in response to AMD3100 administration. We hypothesized that this discrepancy in mobilization could be explained by AMD3100-activating C5 in Rag(-/-), SCID, and C2.Cfb(-/-) animals in a non-canonical mechanism involving activated granulocytes. To support this, granulocytes (i) first egress from BM and (ii) secrete several proteases that cleave/activate C5 in response to AMD3100. We conclude that AMD3100-directed mobilization of HSPCs, similarly to G-CSF-induced mobilization, depends on activation of CC; however, in contrast to G-CSF, AMD3100 activates the distal steps of CC directly at the C5 level. Overall, these data support that C5 cleavage fragments and distal steps of CC activation are required for optimal mobilization of HSPCs.","['Lee, H M', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Liu, R', 'Shin, D-M', 'Kucia, M', 'Botto, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Lee HM', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Liu R', 'Shin DM', 'Kucia M', 'Botto M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Complement C5)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzylamines', '*Complement Activation', 'Complement C5/deficiency/*physiology', 'Cyclams', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009271 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.271 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Mar;24(3):573-82. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.271.

The value of event-free survival (EFS)+/-s.e. was 67.2+/-2.2% at 10 years in L84-11, which was not improved in the following two studies, and eventually improved to 75.0+/-1.8% at 10 years in L95-14 study. The lower EFS of the L89-12 reflected a high rate of induction failure because of infection and delayed remission in very high-risk patients. The L92-13 study was characterized by short maintenance therapy; it resulted in poor EFS, particularly in the standard-risk (SR) group and boys. Females did significantly better than males in EFS in the early three studies. The gender difference was not significant in overall survival, partly because >60% of the males survived after the testicular relapse. Randomized studies in the former three protocols revealed that intermediate- or high-dose methotrexate therapy significantly reduced the testicular relapse rate. In the L95-14 study, gender difference disappeared in EFS. Contrary to the results of larger-scale studies, the randomized control study in the L95-14 reconfirmed with updated data that dexamethasone 8 mg/m(2) had no advantage over prednisolone 60 mg/m(2) in the SR and intermediate-risk groups. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was assigned to 100, 80, 44, and 44% of the patients in the studies, respectively. Isolated central nervous system relapse rates decreased to <2% in the last two trials. Secondary brain tumors developed in 12 patients at 8-22 years after cranial irradiation. Improvement of the remission induction rates and the complete omission of irradiation are currently main objectives in our studies.","['Tsuchida, M', 'Ohara, A', 'Manabe, A', 'Kumagai, M', 'Shimada, H', 'Kikuchi, A', 'Mori, T', 'Saito, M', 'Akiyama, M', 'Fukushima, T', 'Koike, K', 'Shiobara, M', 'Ogawa, C', 'Kanazawa, T', 'Noguchi, Y', 'Oota, S', 'Okimoto, Y', 'Yabe, H', 'Kajiwara, M', 'Tomizawa, D', 'Ko, K', 'Sugita, K', 'Kaneko, T', 'Maeda, M', 'Inukai, T', 'Goto, H', 'Takahashi, H', 'Isoyama, K', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Hosoya, R', 'Hanada, R']","['Tsuchida M', 'Ohara A', 'Manabe A', 'Kumagai M', 'Shimada H', 'Kikuchi A', 'Mori T', 'Saito M', 'Akiyama M', 'Fukushima T', 'Koike K', 'Shiobara M', 'Ogawa C', 'Kanazawa T', 'Noguchi Y', 'Oota S', 'Okimoto Y', 'Yabe H', 'Kajiwara M', 'Tomizawa D', 'Ko K', 'Sugita K', 'Kaneko T', 'Maeda M', 'Inukai T', 'Goto H', 'Takahashi H', 'Isoyama K', 'Hayashi Y', 'Hosoya R', 'Hanada R']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Japan. mtsuchida@ibaraki-kodomo.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009260 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.260 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):383-96. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.260.

The current standard of care has evolved from single-agent therapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, through the introduction of purine analogs to the more recent introduction of chemoimmunotherapy. Selection of appropriate initial therapy should be based primarily on patient characteristics such as age, performance status and the expected clinical course of the leukemia based on established risk factors. Achieving a complete and durable response is the major goal for fit patients; chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab would be advantageous. Alternatively, in unfit patients, controlling symptoms is the essential treatment goal and a regimen with a more favorable toxicity profile should be applied. This manuscript reviews the data that has lead to current treatment choices, advises on tailored therapies and discusses emerging trends.

The cell cycle distribution of curcumin-treated CCRF-CEM cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA damage induced by oxidants such as curcumin-Cu (II) ions is considered as one of the main causes of cell inactivation. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of curcumin on DNA damage by agarose gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Gel electrophoresis analyses showed that curcumin or Cu (II) alone failed to cause DNA damage in pBR322 plasmid DNA as compared with the normal plasmid. However, DNA plasmids were mostly damaged after treatment with curcumin of different concentrations in the presence of Cu (II). Two forms were observed by means of AFM: closed circular plasmids and linear plasmids. DNA damage induced by a combination of curcumin and Cu (II) was also found by agarose gel electrophoresis, which was applied as control method to verify the results obtained by AFM.","['Kong, Yu', 'Ma, Wei', 'Liu, Xia', 'Zu, Yuangang', 'Fu, Yujie', 'Wu, Nan', 'Liang, Lu', 'Yao, Liping', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kong Y', 'Ma W', 'Liu X', 'Zu Y', 'Fu Y', 'Wu N', 'Liang L', 'Yao L', 'Efferth T']","['Key Laboratory of Forest Plant Ecology, Ministry of Education, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, China. kongyu820202@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Plasmids']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules14125328 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules14125328 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2009 Dec 17;14(12):5328-38. doi: 10.3390/molecules14125328.,10.3390/molecules14125328 [doi],20091217,,,,,PMC6255027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They comprise of a diverse group of primary and metastatic neoplasms in both children and adults. The most common small cell tumors of bone include Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor, small cell osteosarcoma, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although each entity has its distinctive features, the differential diagnosis of this group of tumors is still challenging because they are all ""small, blue, and round cell tumors"", histologically. The correct diagnosis of small cell tumors of bone depends on an evaluation of clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and genetic features. Patients' age and sex are very important, as are the signs and symptoms at presentation. Radiologically, which bone is involved, the specific portion of the bone (epiphysis, metaphysis, or diaphysis; cortex vs. medulla) involved, and the radiographic manifestations (lytic, blastic, or mixed lytic and blastic) are also often critical parameters for the diagnosis. In recent years, with a better understanding of the molecular and cytogenetic background of several small cell tumors, more accurate diagnoses have been supported by the clinicopathologic criteria and by a panel of immunohistochemical studies.

Several studies demonstrated the unique gene expression profile associated with MLL-rearranged ALL, but generally small cohorts were analyzed as uniform patient groups regardless of the type of MLL translocation, whereas the analysis of translocation-negative infant ALL remained unacknowledged. Here we generated and analyzed primary infant ALL expression profiles (n = 73) typified by translocations t(4;11), t(11;19), and t(9;11), or the absence of MLL translocations. Our data show that MLL germline infant ALL specifies a gene expression pattern that is different from both MLL-rearranged infant ALL and pediatric precursor B-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that, apart from a fundamental signature shared by all MLL-rearranged infant ALL samples, each type of MLL translocation is associated with a translocation-specific gene expression signature. Finally, we show the existence of 2 distinct subgroups among t(4;11)-positive infant ALL cases characterized by the absence or presence of HOXA expression, and that patients lacking HOXA expression are at extreme high risk of disease relapse. These gene expression profiles should provide important novel insights in the complex biology of MLL-rearranged infant ALL and boost our progress in finding novel therapeutic solutions.","['Stam, Ronald W', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'Hagelstein, Jill A P', 'van der Linden, Marieke H', 'Stumpel, Dominique J P M', 'de Menezes, Renee X', 'de Lorenzo, Paola', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Stam RW', 'Schneider P', 'Hagelstein JA', 'van der Linden MH', 'Stumpel DJ', 'de Menezes RX', 'de Lorenzo P', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. r.stam@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56528-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-233049 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Apr 8;115(14):2835-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-233049.

Sesamin has been shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation and regulate cytokine production. In this study, we examined the effect of sesamin on inflammatory responses elicited by the bacterial chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF) in vitro and in vivo and explored the mechanisms involved. fMLF is recognized by a human G protein-coupled receptor formyl peptide receptor (FPR) on phagocytic leukocytes. Sesamin at concentrations between 12.5 and 50 micromol/L inhibited fMLF-induced chemotaxis of human monocyte cell line THP-1 differentiated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (P < 0.01). Similarly, sesamin inhibited FPR-transfected rat basophilic leukemia cell [epitope-tagged human FPR (ETFR) cell] migration toward fMLF (P < 0.01). In fMLF-induced inflammation in a murine air-pouch model, intraperitoneal administration of sesamin (12 mgkg(-1)d(-1) for 2 d) suppressed leukocyte infiltration into the air pouch induced by fMLF [(62.89 +/- 7.93) x 10(4) vs. (19.67 +/- 4.43) x 10(4) cells/air pouch; n = 9; P < 0.001]. Ca(2+) mobilization and mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation are involved in fMLF-induced leukocyte migration. Pretreatment of ETFR cells with sesamin inhibited fMLF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect fMLF-induced Ca(2+) flux. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that pretreatment of THP-1 cells with sesamin dose dependently inhibited fMLF-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. These results suggest that sesamin inhibits leukocyte activation by fMLF through ERK1/2- and NF-kappaB-related signaling pathways and thus is a potential compound for the management of inflammatory diseases.","['Cui, Youhong', 'Hou, Xinwei', 'Chen, Juan', 'Xie, Lianying', 'Yang, Lang', 'Le, Yingying']","['Cui Y', 'Hou X', 'Chen J', 'Xie L', 'Yang L', 'Le Y']","['Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'S7946O4P76 (sesamin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bacteria/metabolism', 'Basophils/drug effects', 'Bucladesine', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Dioxoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*drug therapy', 'Lignans/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Models, Animal', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/metabolism', 'Sesamum/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jn.109.117804 [pii]', '10.3945/jn.109.117804 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2010 Feb;140(2):377-81. doi: 10.3945/jn.109.117804.

Three cases are reported of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands, with the goal of better defining this entity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All three cases showed a characteristic nodular/multinodular growth pattern and classic biphasic tubular histology. All parts of each tumor were surrounded by a myoepithelial cell rim and there was evidence of invasion. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells to be weakly positive for S100, cytokeratin (CK) CK5/6, CK7, CKAE-1/AE-3 and strongly positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and p63; they were focally positive for calponin and acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CD10). The tumor cells were negative for vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (except one case), glial fibrillar acid protein (GFAP) and MIB1. The tumors were resected completely with wide margins and no recurrence or metastasis had occurred from 6 to 15 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Three cases of minor salivary gland tumors are described and the differential diagnosis underlined in relation to benign myoepithelioma. The characteristic morphological and immunohistochemical features aided diagnosis of these biphasic tumors.","['Angiero, Francesca', 'Sozzi, Davide', 'Seramondi, Rossella', 'Valente, Maria Gabriella']","['Angiero F', 'Sozzi D', 'Seramondi R', 'Valente MG']","['Anatomia Patologica, Ospedale San Gerardo Via Pergolesi 33, Monza, Italy. f.angiero@teos.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['68238-35-7 (Keratins)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Epithelial Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Keratins/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myoepithelioma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['29/11/4703 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Nov;29(11):4703-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural plant-derived substances with antileukemic properties offer new treatment possibilities or may act as by-stander therapy. Their molecular mechanisms of action are often not entirely clear, limiting theory-directed screening and application strategies. The plant substance curcumin is a known activator of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and has well-documented antileukemic effects. The AhR regulates cell processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. We ask here whether direct AhR-activation by curcumin contributes to its antileukemic/apoptotic potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The induction of caspases 3/7, 8, and 9, the breakdown of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the BCL-2/BAX ratio, and the DNA content of cells were measured as indicators of apoptosis. In addition, the induction of cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 were assessed. RESULTS: While triggering of AhR signalling by curcumin in HL-60 cells was confirmed, induction of the above apoptosis parameters was not blocked by two AhR antagonists, alpha-naphtoflavone (alphaNF) and 3'-methoxy-4'nitroflavone (MNF). Only a moderate (20%) AhR-dependent induction of caspases 3/7 was detectable. Interestingly, transcriptional changes induced by curcumin and by anticarcinogenic 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 overlapped by one third. CONCLUSION: We conclude that AhR is only marginally involved in the antileukemic effects of its ligand curcumin.","['Goergens, Andreas', 'Frericks, Markus', 'Esser, Charlotte']","['Goergens A', 'Frericks M', 'Esser C']","[""Auf'm Hennekamp 50, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"[""0 (3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone)"", '0 (Benzoflavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '604-59-1 (alpha-naphthoflavone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoflavones/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['29/11/4657 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Nov;29(11):4657-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Cyclopamine and quercetin suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in seven and eight cell lines respectively.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an immunoconjugate of an anti-CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, which is a potent cytotoxic agent that causes double-strand DNA breaks, resulting in cell death. GO was developed against CD33 antigen-positive leukemias. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of this agent in combination with conventional antileukemic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of GO in combination with antileukemic agents were studied against human CD33 antigen-positive leukemia HL-60, U937, TCC-S and NALM20 cells. The leukemia cells were exposed simultaneously to GO and to the other agents for 4 days. Cell growth inhibition was determined using a MTT reduction assay. The isobologram method was used to evaluate the cytotoxic interaction. RESULTS: GO produced synergistic effects with mitoxantrone, additive effects with cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, doxorubicin, etoposide and 6-mercaptopurine, and antagonistic effects with methotrexate and vincristine. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the simultaneous administration of GO with most agents studied would be advantageous for antileukemic activity. The simultaneous administration of GO with methotrexate or vincristine would have little cytotoxic effect, and this combination may be inappropriate. These findings may be useful in clinical trials of combination chemotherapy including GO or other monoclonal antibodies linked to calicheamicin.","['Tanaka, Masaru', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', 'Akutsu, Miyuki', 'Tsunoda, Saburo', 'Izumi, Tohru', 'Yazawa, Yasuo', 'Miyawaki, Shuich', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Tanaka M', 'Kano Y', 'Akutsu M', 'Tsunoda S', 'Izumi T', 'Yazawa Y', 'Miyawaki S', 'Mano H', 'Furukawa Y']","['Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Gemtuzumab', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'U937 Cells', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['29/11/4589 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Nov;29(11):4589-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, it is under investigation for the therapy of several other malignant tumours since protein kinases are frequently mutated or otherwise deregulated in human malignancies and they serve as a target for differentiating between tumour cells and normal tissues. The objective of this study was to determine whether gamma radiation could sensitize astrocytoma cell lines to the effects of imatinib in vitro. For this purpose, T98G and MOG-G-UVW astrocytoma cells were treated with imatinib alone or in combination with gamma radiation. The clonogenic survival assays performed with the combination of imatinib with radiation demonstrated that the drug had an additive antiproliferative effect in both cell lines considered. Imatinib confered greater radiosensitivity on the T98G tumour cells effecting a significant decrease in colony formation compared with radiation alone. These data provide a rationale to further investigate the combination of imatinib with radiation, keeping in mind that this may result in unexpected toxicities that are not observed with either treatment alone.","['Ranza, E', 'Bertolotti, A', 'Facoetti, A', 'Mariotti, L', 'Pasi, F', 'Ottolenghi, A', 'Nano, R']","['Ranza E', 'Bertolotti A', 'Facoetti A', 'Mariotti L', 'Pasi F', 'Ottolenghi A', 'Nano R']","['Department of Nuclear and Theoretical Physics, University of Pavia, Via Bassi 6, 27100 Pavia, Italy. elena_ranza@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Astrocytoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Benzamides', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gamma Rays', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['29/11/4575 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Nov;29(11):4575-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of aloe-emodin on human tongue squamous carcinoma SCC-4 cells. The results indicated that aloe-emodin induced cell death through S-phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with 30 microM of aloe-emodin led to S-phase arrest through promoted p53, p21 and p27, but inhibited cyclin A, E, thymidylate synthase and Cdc25A levels. Aloe-emodin promoted the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), endonuclease G (Endo G), pro-caspase-9 and cytochrome c from the mitochondria via a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) which was associated with a increase in the ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax)/B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and activation of caspase-9 and -3. The free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and caspase inhibitors markedly blocked aloe-emodin-induced apoptosis. Aloe-emodin thus induced apoptosis in the SCC-4 cells through the Fas/death-receptor, mitochondria and caspase cascade. Aloe-emodin could be a novel chemotherapeutic drug candidate for the treatment of human tongue squamous cancer in the future.","['Chiu, Tsan-Hung', 'Lai, Wan-Wen', 'Hsia, Te-Chun', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Lai, Tung-Yuan', 'Wu, Ping-Ping', 'Ma, Chia-Yu', 'Yeh, Chin-Chung', 'Ho, Chin-Chin', 'Lu, Hsu-Feng', 'Wood, W Gibson', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Chiu TH', 'Lai WW', 'Hsia TC', 'Yang JS', 'Lai TY', 'Wu PP', 'Ma CY', 'Yeh CC', 'Ho CC', 'Lu HF', 'Wood WG', 'Chung JG']","['Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'C8IYT9CR7C (aloe emodin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['29/11/4503 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Nov;29(11):4503-11.,,,,,,"['AG-18357/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG-23524/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the search for compounds that regulate and overcome apoptosis deficiency of cancer cells is also of great therapeutic importance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven known pentacyclic triterpenes and one steroid were isolated from Euphorbia lagascae methanolic extracts and identified by physical and spectroscopic methods. These compounds, together with eleven terpenoids previously isolated from Euphorbia lagascae and E. tuckeyana were tested for their MDR-reversing and/or apoptosis induction activities by flow cytometry on L5178 human MDR1 gene-transfected mouse lymphoma cells. RESULTS: Four taraxastane-type triterpenes: 21alpha-hydroxytaraxasterol, 21alpha-hydroxytaraxasterol acetate, 3beta,30-dihydroxy-20(21)-taraxastene and 3beta-hydroxy-20-taraxasten-30-al, and two steroids: stigmastane-3,6-dione and ergosterol peroxide exhibited a significant MDR-Pgp modulation activity.

Here the prognostic impact of proto-oncogene PIM-1 was analyzed in gastric carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer tissues of 117 patients with potentially curative (R0) resections for gastric cancer were immunohistochemically stained for PIM-1. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for PIM-1 in tumor (46%) was higher (p=0.003) compared to that in gastric glands (16%) and foveolae (1%). PIM-1 immunoreactivity in gastric carcinoma correlated with tumor grading (p<0.05) and Lauren category (p<0.02). Overexpression of PIM-1 in gastric glands (p<0.001) was associated with formation of lymph node metastases (p=0.035) and survival (p=0.04). Multivariate analysis of PIM-1 expression in gastric glands confirmed its association with prognosis. CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of PIM-1 oncogene might be a tumor marker for gastric cancer.

Among the many aberrations caused by DS, including shortened stature and distorted facies, are several blood dyscrasias, including childhood leukemias-namely, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic, or lymphocytic, leukemia (ALL). One focus of the diagnosis of ALL is to distinguish it from AML.The benefits of immunophenotyping extend to treatment as well. ALL is associated with an inherited trisomy 21 in DS children (ALL-DS) and with acquired trisomies, +21, 8, and 13, in non-DS children (ALL-NDS). The differences in treatment, outcome, and prognosis between ALL-DS and ALL-NDS can be attributed to the interaction of their respective trisomies with several genetic mutations, including one on the GATA1 growth factor transcription gene. Other mutations are the gene fusion at TEL/AML1, and a new mutation found, which labels the Janus Kinase gene or JAK2 as on oncogenic precursor, which when associated with the B-cell precursor gene or BCP is highly leukomogenic. The treatments for the 2 groups have been based on quality of risk, with ALL-DS children having the highest risk along with the poorest prognosis, but alterations in medication regimens have brought treatment outcomes to near equality. It is worthwhile to study the trisomy 21 because in the future it may provide an understanding of all blood dyscrasias.","['Tigay, Judith Harriet']",['Tigay JH'],"['University of Flint Michigan, 6550 Heritage, West Bloomfield, MI 48322, USA. judykay1229@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Prognosis']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['26/6/362 [pii]', '10.1177/1043454209340321 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2009 Nov-Dec;26(6):362-8. doi: 10.1177/1043454209340321.,10.1177/1043454209340321 [doi],,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently developed anticancer drugs target these molecular mechanisms and good results have been reported for various cancer types. In lung cancer, tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor such as gefitinib and erlotinib have changed clinical practice dramatically. About half of the Japanese patients with lung cancers harbor an activating mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene and they are very sensitive to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Progression-free survival of such patients is approximately 10 months when treated with gefitinib, whereas the survival for those treated with platinum doublet therapy is approximately 6 months. Target therapies against echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion protein or a mutated ERBB2 (v-ERB-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue 2) present in approximately 5% and approximately 3% of the Japanese patients with adenocarcinomas, respectively, are currently under development. Addition of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, cetuximab, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, to platinum doublet therapy significantly but modestly prolonged the survival in recent clinical trials. However, clinical development of small molecule multi-kinase inhibitors including those targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, such as vandetanib, sunitinib and sorafenib, has not been very successful. Through these collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers and pharmaceutical companies, it should be possible to individualize lung cancer treatment to turn this fatal disease into a chronic disorder and, eventually, to cure it.","['Mitsudomi, Tetsuya']",['Mitsudomi T'],"['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan. mitsudom@aichi-cc.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', '*Drug Delivery Systems/trends', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/02/27 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['hyp174 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyp174 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb;40(2):101-6. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyp174.

Ovarian biopsies were performed during laparoscopy in 18 patients with endometrioma and in 10 healthy women. Detection of apoptosis was performed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay. p53 and BCL2 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate BAX , BAK , BCL2 , BCL-XL , survivin and beta-actin ( ACTB ) expression. The p53 protein was positive in a significantly higher number of secondary follicles, whereas the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein was positive in all follicles in unaffected tissue of endometriotic women, compared with the controls. Overexpression of the BCL2 and survivin genes and a decreased BAX and BAK gene expression were observed in the endometriotic group although only the difference in survivin expression was significant (P = 0.016). The BCL2 / BAX ratio showed an increased value in the ovarian cortex in controls compared with endometriosis patients. In conclusion, the reduction of apoptosis in unaffected tissue in women with endometriosis suggests that they may be predisposed to develop endometriosis.","['Depalo, Raffaella', 'Cavallini, Aldo', 'Lorusso, Filomenamila', 'Bassi, Emma', 'Totaro, Ilaria', 'Marzullo, Andrea', 'Bettocchi, Stefano', 'Selvaggi, Luigi']","['Depalo R', 'Cavallini A', 'Lorusso F', 'Bassi E', 'Totaro I', 'Marzullo A', 'Bettocchi S', 'Selvaggi L']","['Centre of Pathophysiology of Human Reproduction and Gametes Cryopreservation, Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Neonatology, University of Bari, Piazza Giulio Cesare, 11-70124 Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Reprod Biomed Online,Reproductive biomedicine online,101122473,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Endometriosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Ovarian Follicle/metabolism', 'Ovary/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1472-6483(09)00088-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rbmo.2009.09.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Biomed Online. 2009 Dec;19(6):808-15. doi: 10.1016/j.rbmo.2009.09.024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The telomere length and the telomerase expression activity of peripheral blood and / or bone marrow mononuclear cells were examined by Tel-FISH, a semi-quantitative method and by TRAP-ELISA respectively; the expressions of ZAP70 and CD38 were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that comparing the telomere length in different stages, there was a tendency that the telomere became prolonged when the stage raised up. There was statistical significant difference between Rai stages III-IV and stage 0, Rai stages III-IV and stages I-II, Binet stage C and stage A, Binet stage C and stage B; while no statistical significant difference existed between Rai stage 0 and stages I-II, Binet stage A and stage B. The telomere length in ZAP70 negative group was found similar as in ZAP70 positive group. The telomere length in CD38 positive group was shorter than that in CD38 negative group, but there was no statistical difference between them. Comparing the telomerase expression activity between different stages, there was a tendency that it increased when the stages went up; comparing the telomerase expression activity at different Rai stages, it increased at the higher stages. One case of CLL demonstrated that telomerase expression did not show at remission stage, but was found at relapse stage, which suggested that telomerase expression may relate to prognosis of disease. It is concluded that the telomerase length is in relation to Rai and Binet stage, which was shorter at higher stage than that at lower stage and intermediate stage. It seemed that the telomerase expression activity increased at higher stages. The expression of telomerase in mononuclear cells is stable and not influenced by treatment.","['Ma, Lan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Chang, Nai-Bai', 'Ke, Xiao-Yan']","['Ma L', 'Wang J', 'Jiang B', 'Liu YR', 'Zhang B', 'Chang NB', 'Ke XY']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2009/12/25 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)06-1409-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Dec;17(6):1409-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from 8 cases of CML and 5 normal individuals were selected by flow cytometry. The methylation status of JunB and CDH13 genes were detected by MS-PCR in selected CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. The expression levels of JunB and CDH13 gene was detected with real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that no methylation of JunB and CDH13 gene was detected in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells of 5 normal individuals. Methylations of JunB and CDH13 promoter were found in 87.5% (7/8) and 50% (4/8) CML CD34(+)CD38(-) cells, percentages of which were significantly higher than those in normal individuals.

In this study we evaluate and compare transfusion effect measures in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia due to treatment of acute leukemia. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty transfusions (28 conventional gamma-irradiated and 12 pathogen-inactivated photochemical-treated PLT concentrates [PCs]) were investigated. PC quality was analyzed immediately before transfusion. Samples were collected from thrombocytopenic patients at 1 and 24 hours for PLT increments and thromboelastography (TEG) with assessments of bleeding score and intertransfusion interval (ITI). Data were analyzed by Spearman's correlation. Patient and PC variables influencing the effect of transfusion were analyzed by use of a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: PLT dose, storage time, and pathogen inactivation correlated with PLT recovery but not with PLT survival (including ITI), TEG, or clinical bleeding. Fever was negatively correlated with PLT survival but did not affect PLT recovery. After 1 and 24 hours, strong correlations were observed within measures of PLT viability and between PLT increment and the TEG value maximal amplitude (MA). Negative correlation was observed between late MA increment and clinical bleeding status after transfusion (r = -0.494, p = 0.008). PLT count increments did not correlate to clinical bleeding status. CONCLUSIONS: PLT dose and quality of PCs are important for optimal immediate transfusion response, whereas duration of transfusion effect is influenced mainly by patient variables. The TEG value MA correlates with PLT count increments and bleeding, thus reflecting both PLT viability and functionality.","['Apelseth, Torunn O', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Wentzel-Larsen, Tore', 'Hervig, Tor']","['Apelseth TO', 'Bruserud O', 'Wentzel-Larsen T', 'Hervig T']","['Blood Bank, the Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. torunn.oveland.apelseth@helse-bergen.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/physiology', 'Body Surface Area', 'Carbon Dioxide/blood', 'Cell Survival', 'Documentation', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/blood/chemically induced', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Norway', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced/*therapy']",2009/12/25 06:00,2010/05/06 06:00,['2009/12/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['TRF2540 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02540.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2010 Apr;50(4):766-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02540.x.

We previously reported that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is abundantly expressed in uterine glandular epithelial cells during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. In the present study, we used a cultured glandular epithelial cell line of human (EM1) to investigate the significance of IGFBP7 in the function of endometrial glands. EM1 cells formed a mesh-like structure on Matrigel, which was accompanied by elevated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP. However, these morphological changes were blocked by treatment with protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (H89). IGFBP7 knockdown using specific short interference RNA (siRNA) inhibited the formation of the mesh-like structure on Matrigel. Cyclic AMP analogs, dibutyryl-cAMP, and N(6)-phenyl-cAMP induced the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which is essential for the onset of implantation. Enhanced LIF expression was suppressed by IGFBP7 siRNA treatment. Western blot analysis revealed that IGFBP7 knockdown results in the aberrant, constitutive expression of the MAPK signaling pathway. These results suggest that IGFBP7 regulates morphological changes of glandular cells by interfering with the normal PKA and MAPK signaling pathways that are associated with the transformation and/or differentiation of endometrial glands.","['Kutsukake, Masahiko', 'Tamura, Kazuhiro', 'Yoshie, Mikihiro', 'Tachikawa, Eiichi']","['Kutsukake M', 'Tamura K', 'Yoshie M', 'Tachikawa E']","['Department of Endocrine Pharmacology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Shape', 'Collagen', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endometrium/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/methods', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Laminin', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Proteoglycans', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mrd.21143 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2010 Mar;77(3):265-72. doi: 10.1002/mrd.21143.,10.1002/mrd.21143 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow-up information of 496 female NHL incident cases diagnosed during 1996-2000 in Connecticut were abstracted from the Connecticut Tumor Registry in 2008; survival analyses were conducted by comparing the Kaplan-Meier curves, and hazard ratios (HR) were computed from the Cox Proportional Hazard models adjusting for demographic and tumor characteristics which were suggested by previous studies to be determinants of NHL survival. We identified six SNPs from four metabolism genes (CYP2E1, GSTP1, GSTT1, and NAT1) that were associated with NHL survival. Specifically, polymorphisms in GSTT1 were associated with follicular lymphoma survival; and polymorphisms in CYP2E1, GSTP1, and NAT1 were associated with survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.

Since asparaginase is a bacterial protein, it may induce formation of antibodies. The reported frequency of anti-asparaginase antibodies is highly variable: antibodies have been reported in as many as 79% of adults and as many as 70% of children after intravenous or intramuscular administration of E.coli asparaginase. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of antibodies during induction and continuation phases in newly diagnosed children with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma during therapy with E.coli asparaginase, had any correlation with various factors such as: age, gender, hypersensitivity reactions, response to therapy and Event Free Survival (EFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between the period from March 2005 to May 2007, sixty-four children who attended the Menia outpatient pediatric oncology clinic, or were admitted to the inpatient department of the Menia oncology center, were enrolled in the study. Forty children had newly diagnosed ALL and 24 had lymphoblastic lymphoma. Patients were 48 males (75%) and 16 females (25%) with a male:female ratio 3:1. Their ages ranged from 3.5 to 17 years with mean age of 9.6 years. All patients received asparaginase therapy according to the St. Jude Total XIII protocol, in a dose of 10,000 IU/m(2)/dose, intramuscularly for 6-9 doses during the induction phase and another 6-9 doses during continuation phase according to disease status. RESULTS: Forty one patients achieved complete remission, 9 had partial remission, and 14 were lost to followup at different intervals of treatment. Antiasparaginase antibodies were detected in 36 patients (56%) out of 64 patients, and 37 patients (60%) out of 62 patients who were treated with asparaginase at day 8 and day 27 of induction phase respectively. Moreover, 33 patients (61%) out of 54 patients, and 41 patients (83%) out of 50 patients had positive antiasparaginase antibodies at week 10 and week 21 of continuation phase respectively. The 2-year EFS of the whole group was 50%. There was no statistically significant relation between positivity of antiasparaginase antibodies and the following: age, gender, hypersensitivity reaction, response to therapy and EFS. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antiasparaginase antibodies was unrelated to age, gender, hypersensitivity reaction, response to therapy and event free survival of newly diagnosed children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma.","['Ebeid, Emad N', 'Kamel, Magdy M', 'Ali, Basma A']","['Ebeid EN', 'Kamel MM', 'Ali BA']","['The Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. emadebeid@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*blood/immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2008/06/01 00:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2008 Jun;20(2):127-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of ZAP-70 in Tcell function is well established, and in the previous years, this molecule was considered to be T-cell specific. More recent data have documented a role of ZAP-70 in B cells. Interest in ZAP-70 has grown since it has been shown, through gene expression profiling, that it is expressed in a subset of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ZAP-70 in leukemic blasts of 50 newly diagnosed patients of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and to assess the correlation between ZAP-70 expression and various prognostic factors and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 50 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed B-lineage ALL. They were 28 males (56% ) and 22 females (44% ) presented to the Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, during the period from 2005 to 2007. The age range was 2 to 17 years with a mean of 8.58+/-5.8 years and median 8 years. All patients were subjected at presentation to a full clinical history and physical examination. Patients diagnosed with ALL were enrolled on St. Jude Total XV protocol: standard risk and low risk according to results of primary investigation. Immunophenotyping was done using monoclonal antibodies which were analyzed on Coulter XL (Panel included CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD22, Cytoplasmic m, anti k, anti l, CD13, CD33, anti classII MHC and TdT). Cases were considered ZAP-70 positive when exhibiting a ZAP/GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) ratio >or= 0.13. RESULTS: The study revealed expression of ZAP-70 in 5/50 cases (10% ). There was no statistically significant relation between ZAP-70 expression and the following: age, Total Leukocytic Count, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. There was a correlation however between ZAP-70- expression and sex. Four patients died of disease progression: one patient with positive ZAP-70 expression and 3 patients with negative ZAP-70 expression. Fifteen patients (30% ) relapsed after achieving complete remission (CR) and 3 patients (6% ) did not achieve CR. Four patients of those who relapsed had positive ZAP-70 expression. The 2.5 years DFS was 73.1% for negative ZAP-70 cases while it was 20% in positive ZAP-70 cases. There was a statistically significant difference between 2.5-year DFS and ZAP-70 expression (p=0.048). The Overall Survival at 2.5-years for negative ZAP-70 cases was 93.3% while it was 80% for positive ZAP-70 cases with p-value =0.27. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in B-Lineage ALL, ZAP-70 expression correlates with a worse DFS and an increased relapse rate. Furthermore, these results raise the need of prospective trials to evaluate the possibility of designing new compounds targeting this protein.","['Ebeid, Emad', 'Kamel, Magdy', 'Moussa, Heba', 'Galal, Usama']","['Ebeid E', 'Kamel M', 'Moussa H', 'Galal U']","['The Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. emadebeid@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",2008/06/01 00:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2008 Jun;20(2):121-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To investigate the prevalence of the expression of CD34, CD10 and myeloid associated antigens (CD13/ CD33) in childhood T-ALL and to relate their presence to initial clinical and biologic features and early response to therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 67 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL recruited from the Children's Cancer Hospital in Egypt during the time period from July 2007 to June 2008. Immunophenotypic markers and minimal residual disease (MRD) were studied by five-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: The frequency of CD34 was 34.9% , CD10 33.3% , while CD13/CD33 was 18.8%. No significant association was encountered between CD34, CD10 or myeloid antigen positivity and the presenting clinical features as age, sex, TLC and CNS leukemia. Only CD10(+) expression had significant association with initial CNS involvement (p=0.039). CD34 and CD13/CD33 expression was significantly associated with T-cell maturation stages (p<0.05). No relationship was observed for age, TLC, gender, NCI risk or CNS involvement with early response to therapy illustrated by BM as well as MRD day 15 and day 42. CD34(+), CD13/CD33(+) and early T-cell stage had high MRD levels on day 15 that was statistically highly significant (p<0.01), but CD10(+) had statistically significant lower MRD level on day 15 (p=0.049). However, only CD34 retained its significance at an MRD cut-off level of 0.01%. CONCLUSIONS: CD34, CD10, CD13/CD33 expression, as well as T-cell maturation stages, may have prognostic significance in pediatric T-ALL as they have a significant impact on early clearance of leukemic cells detected by MRD day 15.","['Sidhom, Iman', 'Shaaban, Khaled', 'Soliman, Sonya', 'Ezzat, Sameera', 'El-Anwar, Wafaa', 'Hamdy, Nayera', 'Yassin, Dina', 'Salem, Sherine', 'Hassanein, Hala', 'Mansour, Mohamed Tarek']","['Sidhom I', 'Shaaban K', 'Soliman S', 'Ezzat S', 'El-Anwar W', 'Hamdy N', 'Yassin D', 'Salem S', 'Hassanein H', 'Mansour MT']","['The Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.

There are few data on cancer in adults with NS, but the reported numbers of malignancies in adults do not seem excessive. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare aggressive leukemia in young children. A JMML-like myeloproliferative disorder has been described in about 30 neonates with NS and the PTPN11 mutation. The disorder often regresses spontaneously, but fatal complications may occur.

Seventeen of the children (89.5%) achieved complete hematologic remission, and 2 early deaths occurred from intracranial hemorrhage. ATO-induced leukocytosis was observed in 13 (68.4%) patients. Other ATO-related toxicities were minimal and transient. Postremission ATO therapy continued for 3 years; the most common side effect was ATO-induced neutropenia. With a median follow-up of 53 months (range, 23-76 months), the calculated 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were 83.9% and 72.7%, respectively, which are comparable with results achieved by the use of ATRA plus chemotherapy, which is the standard therapy for APL. No chronic arsenic toxicity or second malignancies were found during the follow-up period, and arsenic retention was not significant in patients off treatment more than 24 months.

Determining an exact tumor type using standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of formalin-fixed tissues can be challenging, especially with metastatic and/or poorly differentiated tumors. Successful IHC is dependent on many factors, including species and tissue type, type and duration of fixation, quality fresh or frozen sectioning, and antibody specificity. The initial approach of most tumor diagnosis IHC applications is distinguishing epithelial from mesenchymal differentiation using vimentin and cytokeratin markers, although false-negative and/or false-positive results may occur. Experimentally, IHC can be employed to investigate the earliest changes in transformed tissues, identifying cellular changes not normally visible with H&E. Individual markers for proliferation, apoptosis, and specific tumor proteins can be used to help distinguish hyperplasia from neoplasia and determine specific tumor origin/type. IHC provides a relatively rapid and simple method to better determine the origin of neoplastic tissue or investigate the behavior or progression of a given neoplasm. Several experimental and diagnostic examples will be presented to illustrate the utility of IHC as a supplement to standard staining techniques.","['Painter, J T', 'Clayton, N P', 'Herbert, R A']","['Painter JT', 'Clayton NP', 'Herbert RA']","['Integrated Laboratory Systems, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA. tpainter@ils-inc.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Keratin-20)', '0 (Keratin-7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Keratin-20/analysis', 'Keratin-7/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Thymoma/pathology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['0192623309356449 [pii]', '10.1177/0192623309356449 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2010 Jan;38(1):131-41. doi: 10.1177/0192623309356449.

The Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway is constitutively activated in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, and Ras activity enhances the oncogenic ability of Bcr-Abl. However, the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl activates the Ras pathway is not completely understood. Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) inhibits activation of MEK by Raf-1 and its downstream signal transduction, resulting in blocking the MAP kinase pathway. In the present study, we found that RKIP was depleted in CML cells. We investigated the interaction between RKIP and Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines and Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells from CML patients. The Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of RKIP and reduced the pERK1/2 status, resulting in inhibited proliferation of CML cells. Moreover, RKIP up-regulated cell cycle regulator FoxM1 expression, resulting in G(1) arrest via p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1) accumulation. In colony-forming unit granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte, colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage, and burst-forming unit erythroid, treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced RKIP and reduced FoxM1 expressions, and inhibited colony formation of Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells, whereas depletion of RKIP weakened the inhibition of colony formation activity by the Abl kinase inhibitors in Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells. Thus, Bcr-Abl represses the expression of RKIP, continuously activates pERK1/2, and suppresses FoxM1 expression, resulting in proliferation of CML cells.","['Takemura, Tomonari', 'Nakamura, Satoki', 'Yokota, Daisuke', 'Hirano, Isao', 'Ono, Takaaki', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Fujisawa, Shinya', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Takemura T', 'Nakamura S', 'Yokota D', 'Hirano I', 'Ono T', 'Shigeno K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Ohnishi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)37825-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.075788 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Feb 26;285(9):6585-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.075788.

Here, we report that VentX, a human Xom homologue, is a LEF/TCF-associated inhibitor of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and a negative regulator of cell proliferation. VentX is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its expression is significantly downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Altered expression of VentX is associated with corresponding changes of LEF/TCF target oncogenes such as cyclin D1, suggesting a potential role of VentX in the clinical behavior of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Gao, Hong', 'Le, Yi', 'Wu, Xiaoming', 'Silberstein, Leslie E', 'Giese, Roger W', 'Zhu, Zhenglun']","['Gao H', 'Le Y', 'Wu X', 'Silberstein LE', 'Giese RW', 'Zhu Z']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (VENTX protein, human)']",IM,"['Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2668 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2668 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Jan 1;70(1):202-11. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2668.

Our aim was to determine the phenotypic profile of T lymphocytes subsets among Mozambican patients co-infected by HIV and HTLV-1. METHODS: We enrolled 29 patients co-infected by HTLV-1 and HIV (co-infected), 59 patients mono-infected by HIV (HIV) and 16 healthy controls (HC), respectively.For phenotypic analysis, cells were stained with the following fluorochrome-labeled anti-human monoclonal antibodies CD4-APC, CD8-PerCP, CD25-PE, CD62L-FITC, CD45RA-FITC. CD45RO-PE, CD38-PE; being analysed by four-colour flow cytometry. RESULTS: We initially found that CD4+ T cell counts were significantly higher in co-infected, as compared to HIV groups. Moreover, CD4+ T Lymphocytes from co-infected patients presented significantly higher levels of CD45RO and CD25, but lower levels of CD45RA and CD62L, strongly indicating that CD4+ T cells are more activated under HTLV-1 plus HIV co-infection. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that HTLV-1/HIV co-infected patients progress with higher CD4+ T cell counts and higher levels of activation markers. In this context, it is conceivable that in co-infected individuals, these higher levels of activation may account for a faster progression to AIDS.","['Gudo, Eduardo Samo', 'Bhatt, Nilesh B', 'Bila, Dulce Ramalho', 'Abreu, Celina Monteiro', 'Tanuri, Amilcar', 'Savino, Wilson', 'Silva-Barbosa, Suse Dayse', 'Jani, Ilesh V']","['Gudo ES', 'Bhatt NB', 'Bila DR', 'Abreu CM', 'Tanuri A', 'Savino W', 'Silva-Barbosa SD', 'Jani IV']","['Department of Immunology, National Institute of Health, Maputo, Mozambique. esamogudo@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Adult', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/virology', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HIV Antibodies/blood', 'HIV-1/immunology/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mozambique']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-9-211 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-9-211 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2009 Dec 22;9:211. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-9-211.,10.1186/1471-2334-9-211 [doi],20091222,,,,,PMC2813852,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second generation BCR/ABL inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib effectively inhibit most imatinib resistance variants, but are ineffective against the gatekeeper mutant, T315I. Gatekeeper mutation activates the kinase by stabilizing the hydrophobic spine. Here, we describe that the rationally designed compound AP24163 can inhibit native and gatekeeper mutants of the BCR/ABL kinase. Structural modelling suggests that AP24163 affects the flexibility of the P-loop and destabilizes the active conformation by disrupting the hydrophobic spine. In vitro screening for drug resistance identified clones with compound mutations involving both the P-loop and T315I. Our studies provide structural insights for the design of inhibitors against the gatekeeper mutant and suggest that up-front combination therapy may be required to prevent the emergence of compound-resistant mutations.","['Azam, Mohammad', 'Powers, John T', 'Einhorn, William', 'Huang, Wei-Sheng', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Zhu, Xiaotian', 'Dalgarno, David', 'Clackson, Tim', 'Sawyer, Tomi K', 'Daley, George Q']","['Azam M', 'Powers JT', 'Einhorn W', 'Huang WS', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Zhu X', 'Dalgarno D', 'Clackson T', 'Sawyer TK', 'Daley GQ']","[""Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, The Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,"['0 (AP 24163)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/pharmacology']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JPP911 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00911.x [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2010 Feb;75(2):223-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00911.x.

However, its effect on myeloid leukemia cells and synergistic agents that can augment the effect of VPA remains unknown. Of the various myeloid cell lines examined, OUN-1, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, showed the most prominent upregulation of MICA/B and ULBP2 in response to VPA. The NKG2DL upregulation was observed only in leukemic cells without apoptosis and the effect was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM/ATR. Several activators of ATM/ATR were screened for their effect on NKG2DL expression, but only hydroxyurea (HU) efficiently upregulated both MICA/B and ULPB2 expression on the cell line. VPA and HU synergistically upregulated the NKG2DLs on OUN-1 cells as well as primary leukemic cells from some patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The upregulation of NKG2DLs by VPA and/or HU was associated with increased transcription of each NKG2DL gene. OUN-1 cells treated with VPA + HU were more susceptible to killing by natural killer (NK) cells than untreated cells and the enhanced cytotoxicity of NK cells was blocked by the treatment of NK cells with anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibodies. The same concentrations of VPA and HU did not affect the cytotoxicity of NK cells against OUN-1 cells. These data suggest that VPA and HU might enhance the NK cell-mediated antileukemia effect by increasing the susceptibility of myeloid leukemic cells to NK cells.","['Lu, Xuzhang', 'Ohata, Kinya', 'Kondo, Yukio', 'Espinoza, J Luis', 'Qi, Zhirong', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Lu X', 'Ohata K', 'Kondo Y', 'Espinoza JL', 'Qi Z', 'Nakao S']","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (ULBP2 protein, human)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1439 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01439.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Mar;101(3):609-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01439.x.

JTE-607 was originally identified as a multiple cytokine inhibitor that suppresses production of proinflammatory cytokines from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Herein, we report that JTE-607 exhibits inhibitory activity on the growth of AML cell lines accompanying reduction of the proinflammatory cytokine and growth factor production. In in vitro studies, JTE-607 suppressed expression and production of cytokines, which are spontaneously up-regulated in AML cell lines. JTE-607 also abrogated proliferation of AML cells in a concentration range in which colony formation of normal bone marrow cells was not affected. The growth inhibition by JTE-607 was characterized by induction of cell-cycle arrest at the S-phase and apoptosis, accompanied by a decrease in c-Myc and increase in p21(waf1/cip1). In a leukemia model engrafted with U-937 cells, JTE-607 significantly prolonged survival in mice and reduced human cytokine mRNA levels in the bone marrow.

High levels of tyrosine phosphorylated Vav1 accumulate in differentiating APL-derived cells, suggesting that one or more Vav1 tyrosine residues are involved in neutrophil differentiation of tumoral promyelocytes. Here, we have found that phosphorylation of Vav1 Y174, that is known to regulate Vav1 activity in mature neutrophils, is up-regulated by ATRA in NB4 cells. Nevertheless, this tyrosine residue does not seem crucial for the agonist-induced phenotypical differentiation of APL-derived cells. Mass spectrometry analysis performed on Vav1 from differentiating NB4 cells allowed to identify the highly conserved Y745 residue as a phosphorylated tyrosine that plays crucial roles in the completion of the maturation program of this cell line. In fact, the overexpression of a mutated form of Vav1, in which Y745 was replaced with a phenylalanine, significantly reduced the ATRA-induced CD11b expression and essentially abrogated the differentiation-related acquisition of the migratory capability. Even though the intracellular signaling involving Vav1 phosphorylated in Y745 is unknown, the identification of a tyrosine residue essential for differentiation of tumoral precursors may constitute the basis to identify new specific targets for differentiation therapy of APL.","['Bertagnolo, Valeria', 'Grassilli, Silvia', ""D'Aguanno, Simona"", 'Brugnoli, Federica', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Faenza, Irene', 'Nika, Ervin', 'Urbani, Andrea', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Capitani, Silvano']","['Bertagnolo V', 'Grassilli S', ""D'Aguanno S"", 'Brugnoli F', 'Bavelloni A', 'Faenza I', 'Nika E', 'Urbani A', 'Cocco L', 'Capitani S']","['Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Human Anatomy, Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2009/12/24 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2009/12/24 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr900581y [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2010 Feb 5;9(2):752-60. doi: 10.1021/pr900581y.,10.1021/pr900581y [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have associated exposure to non-ionizing radiation generated by low frequency magnetic fields with childhood leukemia. The current article reviews the case-control studies published on this subject. Of 152 articles tracked in different databases, ten studies from North America, Asia, and Europe met the defined selection criteria, with patients diagnosed from 1960 to 2004. Methodological limitations were observed in these articles, including difficulties with the procedures for assessing exposure. An association may exist between exposure to low frequency magnetic fields and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, but this association is weak, preventing the observation of consistency in the findings. Future studies from a wider range of geographic regions should focus on the analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is the subtype with the greatest impact on the increasing overall incidence of childhood leukemia.","['Pelissari, Daniele Maria', 'Barbieri, Flavio Eitor', 'Wunsch Filho, Victor']","['Pelissari DM', 'Barbieri FE', 'Wunsch Filho V']","['Faculdade de Saude Publica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil. danipelica@usp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors']",2010/01/21 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2009001500009 [pii]', '10.1590/s0102-311x2009001500009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2009;25 Suppl 3:S441-52. doi: 10.1590/s0102-311x2009001500009.,S0102-311X2009001500009 [pii],,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this fundamental concept has yet to be established for solid tumors including breast cancer. In this communication, we analyzed solid tumor cancer stem cell markers in human breast cancer cell lines and primary specimens using flow cytometry. The stem/progenitor cell properties of different marker expressing-cell populations were further assessed by in vitro soft agar colony formation assay and the ability to form tumors in NOD/SCID mice. We found that the expression of stem cell markers varied greatly among breast cancer cell lines. In MDA-MB-231 cells, PROCR and ESA, instead of the widely used breast cancer stem cell markers CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) and ALDH, could be used to highly enrich cancer stem/progenitor cell populations which exhibited the ability to self renew and divide asymmetrically. Furthermore, the PROCR(+)/ESA(+) cells expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. PROCR could also be used to enrich cells with colony forming ability from MB-361 cells. Moreover, consistent with the marker profiling using cell lines, the expression of stem cell markers differed greatly among primary tumors. There was an association between metastasis status and a high prevalence of certain markers including CD44(+)/CD24(-/low), ESA(+), CD133(+), CXCR4(+) and PROCR(+) in primary tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest that similar to leukemia, several stem/progenitor cell-like subpopulations can exist in breast cancer.","['Hwang-Verslues, Wendy W', 'Kuo, Wen-Hung', 'Chang, Po-Hao', 'Pan, Chi-Chun', 'Wang, Hsing-Hui', 'Tsai, Sheng-Ta', 'Jeng, Yung-Ming', 'Shew, Jin-Yu', 'Kung, John T', 'Chen, Chung-Hsuan', 'Lee, Eva Y-H P', 'Chang, King-Jen', 'Lee, Wen-Hwa']","['Hwang-Verslues WW', 'Kuo WH', 'Chang PH', 'Pan CC', 'Wang HH', 'Tsai ST', 'Jeng YM', 'Shew JY', 'Kung JT', 'Chen CH', 'Lee EY', 'Chang KJ', 'Lee WH']","['Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (Endothelial Protein C Receptor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (PROCR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)']",IM,"['Agar', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'CD24 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Endothelial Protein C Receptor', 'Epithelium/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Mesoderm/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/03/18 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008377 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Dec 21;4(12):e8377. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008377.,10.1371/journal.pone.0008377 [doi],20091221,,,,['R01 CA094170/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2793431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clofarabine was administered intravenously for 5 days at 30 mg/m(2)/d during induction and 20 mg/m(2)/d during reinduction/consolidation (six cycles maximum). The primary end point was overall remission rate (ORR; ie, complete remission [CR] plus CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]). RESULTS: In 112 evaluable patients who were treated (median age, 71 years; range, 60 to 88 years), the ORR was 46% (38% CR, 8% CRp). ORR by unfavorable prognostic factor was 39% for patients >or= 70 years of age; 32% for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2; 51% for antecedent hematologic disorder; 54% for intermediate karyotype; 42% for unfavorable karyotype; and 48%, 51%, and 38% for one, two, and three risk factors, respectively. The median disease-free survival was 37 weeks (95% CI, 26 to 56 weeks). Median duration of remission was 56 weeks (95% CI, 33 to not estimable). The estimated median overall survival was 41 weeks (95% CI, 28 to 53 weeks) for all patients, 59 weeks for patients with CR/CRp, and 72 weeks for patients with CR. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 9.8%. The most common non-laboratory drug-related toxicities (>or= 20% patients) were nausea, febrile neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and fatigue. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine is an active agent with acceptable toxicity in patients age 60 years or older with untreated AML who have at least one unfavorable prognostic factor. ORR did not seem affected by the presence of multiple unfavorable prognostic factors.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Claxton, David', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Lyons, Roger M', 'Kovascovics, Tibor', 'Gabrilove, Janice', 'Craig, Michael', 'Douer, Dan', 'Maris, Michael', 'Petersdorf, Stephen', 'Shami, Paul J', 'Yeager, Andrew M', 'Eckert, Stephen', 'Abichandani, Rekha', 'Faderl, Stefan']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Erba HP', 'Claxton D', 'Arellano M', 'Lyons RM', 'Kovascovics T', 'Gabrilove J', 'Craig M', 'Douer D', 'Maris M', 'Petersdorf S', 'Shami PJ', 'Yeager AM', 'Eckert S', 'Abichandani R', 'Faderl S']","['University of Texas M.

Approximately one third of these patients were classified as having acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under current WHO criteria. This analysis compared the effects of azacitidine versus CCR on OS in this subgroup. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous azacitidine 75 mg/m(2)/d or CCR (best supportive care [BSC] only, low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), or intensive chemotherapy [IC]). RESULTS: Of the 113 elderly patients (median age, 70 years) randomly assigned to receive azacitidine (n = 55) or CCR (n = 58; 47% BSC, 34% LDAC, 19% IC), 86% were considered unfit for IC. At a median follow-up of 20.1 months, median OS for azacitidine-treated patients was 24.5 months compared with 16.0 months for CCR-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.79; P = .005), and 2-year OS rates were 50% and 16%, respectively (P = .001). Two-year OS rates were higher with azacitidine versus CCR in patients considered unfit for IC (P = .0003). Azacitidine was associated with fewer total days in hospital (P < .0001) than CCR.

Response was assessed by weekly CBC and bone marrow biopsy after cycle 2 and after each subsequent cycle. Patients continued to receive decitabine until disease progression or an unacceptable adverse event occurred. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (mean age, 74 years) were enrolled and were treated with a median of three cycles (range, one to 25 cycles) of decitabine. The expert-reviewed overall response rate was 25% (complete response rate, 24%). The response rate was consistent across subgroups, including in patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and in those with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-eight adults age >or= 60 years with de novo CN-AML, enrolled onto Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols 9720 and 10201, were studied at diagnosis for NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and WT1 mutations, and gene- and microRNA-expression profiles. RESULTS: Patients with NPM1 mutations (56%) had higher complete remission (CR) rates (84% v 48%; P < .001) and longer disease-free survival (DFS; P = .047; 3-year rates, 23% v 10%) and overall survival (OS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 35% v 8%) than NPM1 wild-type patients. In multivariable analyses, NPM1 mutations remained independent predictors for higher CR rates (P < .001) and longer DFS (P = .004) and OS (P < .001), after adjustment for other prognostic clinical and molecular variables. Unexpectedly, the prognostic impact of NPM1 mutations was mainly observed in patients >or= 70 years. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles associated with NPM1 mutations were similar across older patient age groups and similar to those in younger (< 60 years) patients with CN-AML. These profiles were characterized by upregulation of HOX genes and their embedded microRNAs and downregulation of the prognostically adverse MN1, BAALC, and ERG genes. CONCLUSION: NPM1 mutations have favorable prognostic impact in older patients with CN-AML, especially those age >or= 70 years. The gene- and microRNA-expression profiles suggest that NPM1 mutations constitute a marker defining a biologically homogeneous entity in CN-AML that might be treated with specific and/or targeted therapies across age groups.","['Becker, Heiko', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Margeson, Dean', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Becker H', 'Marcucci G', 'Maharry K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Margeson D', 'Whitman SP', 'Wu YZ', 'Schwind S', 'Paschka P', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wetzler M', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.25.1496 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.25.1496 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 1;28(4):596-604. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.25.1496.

However, the mechanism of GTN-induced apoptosis upstream of mitochondria is still poorly defined. In this study, GTN caused a decrease in GSH with an elevation of reactive oxygen species as early as 30 min and DNA damage as assessed by Comet assay. Analysis using topoisomerase II processing of supercoiled pBR 322 DNA showed that GTN caused DNA damage via a topoisomerase II-independent pathway suggesting that cellular oxidative stress may contribute to genotoxicity. A 12-fold increase of caspase-2 activity was observed in GTN-treated Jurkat cells after 4h treatment and this was confirmed using Western blotting. Although the caspase-2 inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK inhibited the proteolytic activity of caspase-2, apoptosis ensued confirming that caspase-2 activity was not crucial for GTN-induced apoptosis. However, GTN-induced apoptosis was completely abrogated by N-acetylcysteine further confirming the role of oxidative stress. Since cytochrome c release was observed as early as 1h without any appreciable change in Bcl-2 protein expression, we further investigated whether overexpression of Bcl-2 confers resistance in GTN-induced cytotoxicity. Using a panel of Jurkat Bcl-2 transfectants, GTN cytotoxicity was not abrogated in these cells. In conclusion, GTN induces DNA damage and oxidative stress resulting in apoptosis which is independent of both caspase-2 and Bcl-2.","['Inayat-Hussain, S H', 'Chan, K M', 'Rajab, N F', 'Din, L B', 'Chow, S C', 'Kizilors, A', 'Farzaneh, F', 'Williams, G T']","['Inayat-Hussain SH', 'Chan KM', 'Rajab NF', 'Din LB', 'Chow SC', 'Kizilors A', 'Farzaneh F', 'Williams GT']","['Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. salmaan@medic.ukm.my']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-valyl-aspartyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '34W9GO6B2Z (goniothalamin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Comet Assay', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Goniothalamus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Pyrones/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(09)01547-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2010 Mar 1;193(1):108-14. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.12.010.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of CD154 on these adverse effects because CD154 is involved in both B-cell survival and autoimmunity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 36 patients with CLL were cultured in vitro with fludarabine or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine for 24, 48, and 72 hours. RESULTS: Seven patients (19.4%) presented CD154 expression in PBMC cultured with purine analogues in vitro for 24 and/or 48 hours, while no expression was found when cultured in media alone. These seven patients showed a decreased apoptotic rate in vitro after purine analogues compared with those patients who did not express CD154 (p = 0.01 for fludarabine; p < 0.001 for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine). CD154 expression was found to have prognostic value for response to fludarabine in vivo and was associated with the development of autoimmune manifestations (odds ratio = 25; 95% confidence interval = 3.5-166.7; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that CD154 expression in CLL patients, which may be induced by purine analogues, is associated with resistance to fludarabine and with development of autoimmune manifestations.","['Citores, Maria Jesus', 'Castejon, Raquel', 'Villarreal, Mercedes', 'Rosado, Silvia', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose Antonio', 'Vargas, Juan Antonio']","['Citores MJ', 'Castejon R', 'Villarreal M', 'Rosado S', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Vargas JA']","['Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain. mjcitores@telefonica.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Autoimmunity/drug effects', 'CD40 Ligand/*biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00458-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Mar;38(3):165-73. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.12.001.

We therefore attempted to identify the up- and down-stream events involved in the activation of the p73-dependent pro-apoptotic pathway, by focusing on the anti-apoptotic and epigenetic integrator UHRF1 which is essential for cell cycle progression. For this purpose, we analyzed the effects of a known anti-neoplastic drug, thymoquinone (TQ), on the p53-deficient acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Jurkat cell line. Our results showed that TQ inhibits the proliferation of Jurkat cells and induces G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, TQ treatment triggers programmed cell death, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). TQ-induced apoptosis, confirmed by the presence of hypodiploid G0/G1 cells, is associated with a rapid and sharp re-expression of p73 and dose-dependent changes of the levels of caspase-3 cleaved subunits. These modifications are accompanied by a dramatic down-regulation of UHRF1 and two of its main partners, namely DNMT1 and HDAC1, which are all involved in the epigenetic code regulation. Knockdown of p73 expression restores UHRF1 expression, reactivates cell cycle progression and inhibits TQ-induced apoptosis. Altogether our results showed that TQ mediates its growth inhibitory effects on ALL p53-mutated cells via the activation of a p73-dependent mitochondrial and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway which subsequently targets UHRF1.","['Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Abusnina, Abdurazzag', 'Achour, Mayada', 'Sharif, Tanveer', 'Muller, Christian', 'Peluso, Jean', 'Chataigneau, Thierry', 'Lugnier, Claire', 'Schini-Kerth, Valerie B', 'Bronner, Christian', 'Fuhrmann, Guy']","['Alhosin M', 'Abusnina A', 'Achour M', 'Sharif T', 'Muller C', 'Peluso J', 'Chataigneau T', 'Lugnier C', 'Schini-Kerth VB', 'Bronner C', 'Fuhrmann G']","['CNRS UMR7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)01073-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.12.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 May 1;79(9):1251-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.12.015.

Comprehensive analysis of these toxicogenomic and epigenomic profiles by bioinformatics in the context of phenotypic endpoints, comprises systems biology, which has the potential to comprehensively define the mechanisms by which benzene causes leukemia. We have applied this approach to a molecular epidemiology study of workers exposed to benzene. Hematotoxicity, a significant decrease in almost all blood cell counts, was identified as a phenotypic effect of benzene that occurred even below 1 ppm benzene exposure. We found a significant decrease in the formation of progenitor colonies arising from bone marrow stem cells with increasing benzene exposure, showing that progenitor cells are more sensitive to the effects of benzene than mature blood cells, likely leading to the observed hematotoxicity. Analysis of transcriptomics by microarray in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of exposed workers, identified genes and pathways (apoptosis, immune response, and inflammatory response) altered at high (>10 ppm) and low (<1 ppm) benzene levels. Serum proteomics by SELDI-TOF-MS revealed proteins consistently down-regulated in exposed workers. Preliminary epigenomics data showed effects of benzene on the DNA methylation of specific genes. Genomic screens for candidate genes involved in susceptibility to benzene toxicity are being undertaken in yeast, with subsequent confirmation by RNAi in human cells, to expand upon the findings from candidate gene analyses. Data on these and future biomarkers will be used to populate a large toxicogenomics database, to which we will apply bioinformatic approaches to understand the interactions among benzene toxicity, susceptibility genes, mRNA, and DNA methylation through a systems biology approach.","['Zhang, Luoping', 'McHale, Cliona M', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Li, Guilan', 'Ji, Zhiying', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Hubbard, Alan E', 'Ren, Xuefeng', 'Shen, Min', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'North, Matthew', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Vulpe, Christopher', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Lan, Qing']","['Zhang L', 'McHale CM', 'Rothman N', 'Li G', 'Ji Z', 'Vermeulen R', 'Hubbard AE', 'Ren X', 'Shen M', 'Rappaport SM', 'North M', 'Skibola CF', 'Yin S', 'Vulpe C', 'Chanock SJ', 'Smith MT', 'Lan Q']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7356, USA. luoping@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Computational Biology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoietic System/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Systems Biology/methods/trends', 'Toxicogenetics']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00539-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):86-93. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.011.

Although inhibitors of such activated kinases have proved to be of therapeutic benefit in individuals with NSCLC or CML, some patients manifest intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs. We now show that, whereas blockade of either the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway alone induced only a low level of cell death, it markedly sensitized NSCLC or CML cells to the induction of apoptosis by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Such enhanced cell death induced by the respective drug combinations was apparent even in NSCLC or CML cells exhibiting resistance to EGFR or Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, respectively. Co-administration of a cytostatic signaling pathway inhibitor may contribute to the development of safer anticancer strategies by lowering the required dose of cytotoxic HDAC inhibitors for a variety of cancers.","['Ozaki, Kei-Ichi', 'Kosugi, Masaki', 'Baba, Nobuyuki', 'Fujio, Kohsuke', 'Sakamoto, Toshiaki', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Tanimura, Susumu', 'Kohno, Michiaki']","['Ozaki K', 'Kosugi M', 'Baba N', 'Fujio K', 'Sakamoto T', 'Kimura S', 'Tanimura S', 'Kohno M']","['Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, 1-14 Bunkyo-machi, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Analgesics/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*enzymology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Gefitinib', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)02459-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.12.086 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Jan 22;391(4):1610-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.12.086.

Chromosome(s) 7 and/or 5 monosomies or deletions are typical of alkylating agent-induced AML, while balanced translocations involving chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 are associated to preceeding therapy with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors. Antimetabolites, and in particular the immunosuppressive agents azathioprine and fludarabine, have also been recently associated to t-MN. Leukemias developing after benzene exposure are similar to t-MN and are characterized by chromosomal aberrations, which have been also observed among otherwise healthy benzene-exposed workers. Individual predisposing factors, including polymorphisms of detoxification and DNA-repair enzymes have been identified. Two genetic variants in key metabolizing enzymes, myeloperoxidase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, have been shown to influence susceptibility to benzene hematotoxicity. Combination of polymorphisms impairing detoxification and DNA repair may significantly increase therapy-related myeloid neoplasm risk. Among hematological malignancies, long-term survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma are exposed to an increased t-MN risk, particularly when receiving MOPP-based and escalated-BEACOPP regimens, and when alkylators are combined to radiotherapy. Patients with lymphoma are at highest risk if total body irradiation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is used as rescue or consolidation. The addition of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and radiotherapy plays a significant role in t-MN following treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In solid tumors, treatment for breast cancer and germ-cell tumors has been associated with a 1-5% lifetime risk of t-MN.","['Leone, Giuseppe', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Voso, Maria Teresa']","['Leone G', 'Fianchi L', 'Pagano L', 'Voso MT']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo A Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy. gleone@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Disease Susceptibility/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00558-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):39-45. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.013.

In this context the data of 537 confirmed cases of leukemia as an occupational disease in Germany during the time period 1978-2007 will be presented.

The inhibition of these enzymes induces DNA alterations that may also lead to carcinogenic effects; indeed, an increased risk for developing leukemia has been observed in patients treated with some topo II inhibitors. Several flavonoids have been shown to interact with purified topo I and topo II, therefore suggesting that these compounds may possess both anticancer and carcinogenic activity. Because the activity of a drug on purified topoisomerases does not always represent the activity in the cell, the aim of this work is to evaluate the effects of several common dietary flavonoids on these enzymes in cells. Using the cell-based TARDIS assay, we have evaluated the effects of the flavonoids quercetin, apigenin, fisetin and myricetin on topo I and topo II in K562 human leukemia cells at several concentrations and exposure times. Quercetin and apigenin induced moderate levels of topo II-DNA complexes and did not induce topo I-DNA complexes in these cells. Fisetin induced neither topo I- nor topo II-DNA complexes, but behaved as a catalytic inhibitor of both enzymes. Myricetin induced high levels of topo-DNA complexes with both enzymes. In addition, murine embryo fibroblasts lacking topo IIbeta were resistant to myricetin-induced cell-growth inhibition, therefore suggesting that topo IIbeta is an important drug target for this flavonoid. These results support the idea that specific concentrations of some dietary flavonoids may produce topoisomerase-mediated carcinogenic and chemotherapeutic effects in vivo. The ability of myricetin to induce topo-DNA complexes with both topo I and topo II in leukemia cells may be therapeutically useful and deserves further study.","['Lopez-Lazaro, Miguel', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Austin, Caroline A']","['Lopez-Lazaro M', 'Willmore E', 'Austin CA']","['Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, The Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Flavonols)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '76XC01FTOJ (myricetin)', 'OO2ABO9578 (fisetin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flavonols', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2009/12/23 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(09)00432-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2010 Feb;696(1):41-7. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.12.010.

In human epidermal (HaCaT) keratinocytes, 17-COOH-7DA inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, starting at a dose as low as 10(-11) M. This inhibition was accompanied by decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, bcl2 and cyclin E2 mRNAs and by increased expression of involucrin mRNA. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with slowing of the cell cycle in G1/G0 phases but not with cell death. 17-COOH-7DA was significantly more potent than pregnenolone, 17-COOH-pregnenolone, 17-COOCH(3)-7DA and calcitriol. 17-COOH-7DA also inhibited proliferation of normal human epidermal melanocytes and human and hamster melanoma lines, however, with lower potency than for keratinocytes. In normal human dermal fibroblasts 17-COOH-7DA stimulated proliferation in serum-free media but inhibited it in the presence of 5% serum. 17-COOH-7DA inhibited cell colony formation of human and hamster melanoma cells, and induced monocyte-like differentiation of human HL60 leukemia cells. Thus, the new steroidal 5,7-diene, 17-COOH-7DA, can serve as an inhibitor of proliferation of normal keratinocytes and normal and malignant melanocytes, as a condition-dependent regulator of fibroblast proliferation and a stimulator of leukemia cell differentiation.","['Kim, Tae-Kang', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Li, Wei', 'Zjawiony, Jordan', 'Miller, Duane', 'Janjetovic, Zorica', 'Tuckey, Robert C', 'Slominski, Andrzej']","['Kim TK', 'Chen J', 'Li W', 'Zjawiony J', 'Miller D', 'Janjetovic Z', 'Tuckey RC', 'Slominski A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Cancer Research, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Steroids,Steroids,0404536,"['0 (3-hydroxyandrosta-5,7-diene-17-carboxylic acid)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCNE1 protein, human)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Steroids)', '60108-77-2 (involucrin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Carboxylic Acids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Cyclin E/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Melanocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', '*Steroids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-128X(09)00269-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.steroids.2009.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Steroids. 2010 Mar;75(3):230-9. doi: 10.1016/j.steroids.2009.12.004.

The steroidal part is aimed to act as a biological platform enabling the alkylating moiety to approach its site of action by altering its physicochemical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The compounds tested have, as alkylating agents, either p-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl-butyrate or p-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl-acetate esterified with a modified steroidal nucleus. The four newly synthesized compounds were compared on a molar basis, regarding their ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges and modify proliferation rate indices in cultured human lymphocytes. Life span of BDF1 mice inoculated with L1210 leukemia was also estimated (antileukemic activity). RESULTS: A compound having p-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl-acetate as the alkylator and two ketone groups in the steroidal part demonstrated the highest statistically significant enhancement of sister chromatid exchanges and suppression of proliferation rate indices, and also caused significant antineoplastic activity. The other compounds proved less active. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cytogenetic and antileukemic activity of alkylating steroidal esters depends on the configuration of the whole molecule and the appropriate combination of the alkylator with the steroidal molecule.","['Karapidaki, Irini', 'Papageorgiou, Athanasios', 'Geromichalos, George', 'Fousteris, Manolis', 'Papaconstadinou, Ioanna', 'Pairas, George', 'Koutsourea, Anna', 'Mourelatos, Denis', 'Nikolaropoulos, Sotiris', 'Lialiaris, Theodoros']","['Karapidaki I', 'Papageorgiou A', 'Geromichalos G', 'Fousteris M', 'Papaconstadinou I', 'Pairas G', 'Koutsourea A', 'Mourelatos D', 'Nikolaropoulos S', 'Lialiaris T']","['Laboratory of Biology and Genetics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (Androstanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",IM,"['Androstanes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2009.0059 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2010 Feb;14(1):93-7. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2009.0059.,10.1089/gtmb.2009.0059 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that whereas cyanidin-3-rutinoside and delphinidin could induce apoptosis in leukemia cells, they caused growth retardation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC), which was accompanied with a significant cellular vacuolization. The latter was likely caused by macroautophagy and was completely suppressed by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase that is important for autophagy activation, and by bafilomycin A1, which blocks lysosomal degradation. Delphinidin induced significant lipidation of LC3, an indication of macroautophagy, which was also suppressed by 3-methyladenine. Macroautophagy was required for the survival of delphinidin-treated HCC cells as inhibition with 3-methyladenine led to massive necrosis without caspase activation. Thus, anthocyanins could induce different modes of cell death for different cancers. Furthermore, anthocyanins could be used in combination with a macroautophagy inhibitor for treating cancers such as HCC.","['Feng, Rentian', 'Wang, Shiow Y', 'Shi, Ying-Hong', 'Fan, Jia', 'Yin, Xiao-Ming']","['Feng R', 'Wang SY', 'Shi YH', 'Fan J', 'Yin XM']","['Department of Pathology and Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', 'EM6MD4AEHE (delphinidin)']",IM,"['Anthocyanins/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Necrosis']",2009/12/23 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2009/12/23 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf9025458 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2010 Apr 14;58(7):3957-64. doi: 10.1021/jf9025458.,10.1021/jf9025458 [doi],,,,,['R01CA111456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These techniques rely on binding of fluorophores or magnetic particles conjugated to antibodies to target cells. Cell surface marker expression levels within cell populations vary with progression through the cell cycle. In an earlier work we showed the reproducible magnetic fractionation (single pass) of the Jurkat cell line based on the population distribution of CD45 surface marker expression. Here we present a study on magnetic fractionation of a stem and progenitor cell (SPC) population using the established acute myelogenous leukemia cell line KG-1a as a cell model. The cells express a CD34 cell surface marker associated with the hematopoietic progenitor cell activity and the progenitor cell lineage commitment. The CD34 expression level is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of the CD45 marker, which required further improvements of the magnetic fractionation apparatus. The cells were immunomagnetically labeled using a sandwich of anti-CD34 antibody-phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate and anti-PE magnetic nanobead and fractionated into eight components using a continuous flow dipole magnetophoresis apparatus. The CD34 marker expression distribution between sorted fractions was measured by quantitative PE flow cytometry (using QuantiBRITE PE calibration beads), and it was shown to be correlated with the cell magnetophoretic mobility distribution. A flow outlet addressing scheme based on the concept of the transport lamina thickness was used to control cell distribution between the eight outlet ports. The fractional cell distributions showed good agreement with numerical simulations of the fractionation based on the cell magnetophoretic mobility distribution in the unsorted sample.","['Schneider, Thomas', 'Karl, Stephan', 'Moore, Lee R', 'Chalmers, Jeffrey J', 'Williams, P Stephen', 'Zborowski, Maciej']","['Schneider T', 'Karl S', 'Moore LR', 'Chalmers JJ', 'Williams PS', 'Zborowski M']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,"['0 (Antibodies, Immobilized)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '11016-17-4 (Phycoerythrin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Immobilized/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Magnetics', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Phycoerythrin/chemistry', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/b908210g [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2010 Jan;135(1):62-70. doi: 10.1039/b908210g.
