Primed ESCs are distinct from naive cells in biological characteristics, genetic features, developing potentials, and antagonistic signal pathway dependences to support undifferentiated growth. In vitro, naive mESCs are readily converted to primed cells upon transferring to primed pluripotency signaling. ESC-derived epiblast stem cells (ESD-EpiSCs) are stabilized primed cells derived from naive mESCs in vitro, and cannot be maintained with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling with or without mouse embryonic fibroblasts as the feeder layer. Here, we show that the undifferentiated growth of ESD-EpiSCs could be maintained with the basic fibroblast growth factor employing human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) as the feeder layer. Upon exposure to LIF, ESD-EpiSCs could undergo a reprogramming process on hAECs and be converted to naive-like cells converted ESCs (cESCs), in which naive pluripotency markers were activated, and primed markers were suppressed. DNA methylation analysis also validated the epigenetic conversion from primed to naive-like pluripotent status. The bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an important signaling factor in pluripotency controlling, germ cell development, and neural commitment. It showed that ESD-EpiSCs and cESCs exhibited different features toward BMP4. Our results prove that hAECs are ideal feeder cells for both naive and primed ESCs. More importantly, the primed ESCs are allowed to be reprogrammed to naive-like pluripotent cells on hAECs. These findings suggest that under suitable conditions primed ESCs have the potency of converting to naive-like ESCs.","['Chen, Yi-Fei', 'Dong, Zhangli', 'Jiang, Lizheng', 'Lai, Dongmei', 'Guo, Lihe']","['Chen YF', 'Dong Z', 'Jiang L', 'Lai D', 'Guo L']","[""Shanghai Jiaotong University, The International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Rex-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Amnion/*cytology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Feeder Cells/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Germ Layers/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0325 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Jan 15;22(2):320-9. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0325.

The constitutively activated BCR/ABL-kinase ""escapes"" the auto-inhibition mechanisms of c-ABL, such as allosteric inhibition. The ABL-kinase inhibitors (AKIs) Imatinib, Nilotinib or Dasatinib, which target the ATP-binding site, are effective in Ph + leukemia. Another molecular therapy approach targeting BCR/ABL restores allosteric inhibition. Given the fact that all AKIs fail to inhibit BCR/ABL harboring the 'gatekeeper' mutation T315I, we investigated the effects of AKIs in combination with the allosteric inhibitor GNF2 in Ph + leukemia. METHODS: The efficacy of this approach on the leukemogenic potential of BCR/ABL was studied in Ba/F3 cells, primary murine bone marrow cells, and untransformed Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing BCR/ABL or BCR/ABL-T315I as well as in patient-derived long-term cultures (PDLTC) from Ph + ALL-patients. RESULTS: Here, we show that GNF-2 increased the effects of AKIs on unmutated BCR/ABL. Interestingly, the combination of Dasatinib and GNF-2 overcame resistance of BCR/ABL-T315I in all models used in a synergistic manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations establish a new approach for the molecular targeting of BCR/ABL and its resistant mutants using a combination of AKIs and allosteric inhibitors.","['Mian, Afsar Ali', 'Metodieva, Anna', 'Badura, Susanne', 'Khateb, Mamduh', 'Ruimi, Nili', 'Najajreh, Yousef', 'Ottmann, Oliver Gerhard', 'Mahajna, Jamal', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Mian AA', 'Metodieva A', 'Badura S', 'Khateb M', 'Ruimi N', 'Najajreh Y', 'Ottmann OG', 'Mahajna J', 'Ruthardt M']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120917,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GNF-2 compound)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-411 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-411 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Sep 17;12:411. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-411.,PMC3488316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural GSL compounds arglabin, an anticancer clinical drug, and micheliolide (MCL), are able to reduce the proportion of AML stem cells (CD34(+)CD38(-)) in primary AML cells. Targeting of AML stem cells is further confirmed by a sharp reduction of colony-forming units of primary AML cells upon MCL treatment. Moreover, DMAMCL, the dimethylamino Michael adduct of MCL, slowly releases MCL in plasma and in vivo and demonstrates remarkable therapeutic efficacy in the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency AML models.

We have recently shown that HCV core protein mediates functional inactivation of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor pathway. However, the role of PML in HCC development yet remains unclear. To clarify the function of PML in liver carcinogenesis and HCV-associated pathogenesis we crossed PML-deficient mice with HCV transgene (HCV-Tg) expressing mice and treated the resulting animals with DEN/Phenobarbital, an established protocol for liver carcinogenesis. Seven months after treatment, livers were examined macroscopically and histologically. Genetic depletion of the tumor suppressor PML coincided with an increase in hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in development of multiple dysplastic nodules in 100% of the PML-deficient livers and of HCCs in 53%, establishing a tumor suppressive function of PML in the liver. In animals expressing the HCV-transgene in PML-deficient background, HCC development occurred even in 73%, while only 7% of their wildtype littermates developed HCC. The neoplastic nature of the tumors was confirmed by histology and expression of the HCC marker glutamine synthetase. Several pro- and antiapoptotic factors were tested for differential expression and liver carcinogenesis was associated with impaired expression of the proapoptotic molecule TRAIL in PML-deficient mice. In conclusion, this study provides first in vivo evidence that the tumor suppressor PML acts as an important barrier in liver carcinogenesis and HCV-dependent liver pathology.","['Herzer, Kerstin', 'Carbow, Anna', 'Sydor, Svenja', 'Sowa, Jan-Peter', 'Biesterfeld, Stefan', 'Hofmann, Thomas-Georg', 'Galle, Peter-Robert', 'Gerken, Guido', 'Canbay, Ali']","['Herzer K', 'Carbow A', 'Sydor S', 'Sowa JP', 'Biesterfeld S', 'Hofmann TG', 'Galle PR', 'Gerken G', 'Canbay A']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital, Essen, Germany. kerstin.herzer@uk-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (Transaminases)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Liver/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Risk', 'Transaminases/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/*physiology']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044474 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-13648 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44474. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044474.

Small density lipoproteins are atherogenic but have not been studied in this population. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 110 ALL survivors (mean age, 24.3 years) to determine prevalence of small dense LDL (pattern B) phenotype in ALL survivors and identify associated factors. Lipid subfractions were measured using Vertical Auto Profile-II. Participants with greater than 50% of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) in small dense LDL fractions (LDL(3+4)) were classified as LDL pattern B. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT) volumes were also measured by computed tomography. While the mean LDL-c level of ALL survivors was 108.7 +/- 26.8 mg/dl, 36% (40/110) of survivors had atherogenic LDL pattern B. This pattern was more common in males (26/47; 55%) than in females (14/63; 22%, P = 0.001) and more common in survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy (15/33; 45%) than in those who were treated with chemotherapy alone (25/77; 33%; P = 0.04, adjusted for age, gender, history of hypertension, and smoking history). VAT was associated with atherogenic lipids: LDL pattern B and LDL(3+4) levels. This association was independent of other measures of body fat. We conclude that a substantial proportion of ALL survivors had an atherogenic LDL phenotype despite normal mean LDL-c levels. An atherogenic LDL phenotype may contribute to the increase in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in this population.","['Malhotra, Jyoti', 'Tonorezos, Emily S', 'Rozenberg, Marina', 'Vega, Gloria L', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Chou, Joanne', 'Moskowitz, Chaya S', 'Eshelman-Kent, Debra A', 'Janiszewski, Peter', 'Ross, Robert', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Malhotra J', 'Tonorezos ES', 'Rozenberg M', 'Vega GL', 'Sklar CA', 'Chou J', 'Moskowitz CS', 'Eshelman-Kent DA', 'Janiszewski P', 'Ross R', 'Oeffinger KC']","['Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*blood/genetics', 'Male', '*Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/diagnosis/genetics', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2275(20)41809-7 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.P029785 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2012 Dec;53(12):2747-54. doi: 10.1194/jlr.P029785.

Although many studies have highlighted the advantages of positive BAL results in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections, there have been few reports examining the impact of a negative BAL result on clinical management in immunocompromised children on empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate BAL in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections in children with haematological malignancies who develop pneumonia unresponsive to empiric antimicrobial therapy, and also to determine whether a negative BAL result contributed to the clinical management of these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 44 BAL procedures performed in 33 children with haematological malignancy diagnosed and treated at Our Lady's Children Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland, over a 10-year period was carried out. RESULTS: We identified a pathogen causing pneumonia in 24 of 44 BAL procedures (54.5 %). The BAL procedure resulted in modification of antimicrobial treatment after 20 of 24 procedures with positive results (83.3 %) in 16 of 20 patients (80 %). Management was changed after 8 of 20 procedures with negative results (40 %) in 8 of 18 patients (44.4 %). The procedure was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the use of bronchoscopy with BAL as a diagnostic intervention in this patient population. We consider BAL a safe procedure from which both positive and negative results contribute to the patient's clinical management.","['Rao, U', 'Piccin, A', 'Malone, A', ""O'Hanlon, K"", 'Breatnach, F', ""O'Meara, A"", 'McDermott, M', 'Butler, K', ""O'Sullivan, N"", 'Russell, J', ""O'Marcaigh, A"", 'Smith, O P']","['Rao U', 'Piccin A', 'Malone A', ""O'Hanlon K"", 'Breatnach F', ""O'Meara A"", 'McDermott M', 'Butler K', ""O'Sullivan N"", 'Russell J', ""O'Marcaigh A"", 'Smith OP']","[""Department of Haematology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120916,Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*microbiology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Ireland', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Pneumonia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11845-012-0852-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2013 Jun;182(2):177-83. doi: 10.1007/s11845-012-0852-3.

However, ROS also induce pro-survival autophagy through the engulfment of damaged mitochondria. This study is aimed at investigating the cytoprotective role of albumin against NOX/ROS-induced autophagy and apoptosis under serum starvation. Serum starvation induced apoptosis following a myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1)/Bax imbalance, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and caspase activation accompanied by pro-survival autophagy following canonical inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Aberrant ROS generation, initially occurring through NOX, facilitated mitochondrial damage, autophagy, and apoptosis. Autophagy additionally regulated the accumulation of ROS-generating mitochondria. NOX/ROS permitted p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-regulated mitochondrial apoptosis, accompanied by non-canonical induction of autophagy. In addition, activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta by NOX/ROS-inactivated Akt facilitated a decrease in Mcl-1, followed by mitochondrial apoptosis as well as autophagy. Restoring albumin conferred an anti-oxidative effect against serum starvation-deregulated NOX, p38 MAPK, and Akt/GSK-3beta/Mcl-1/caspase-3 signaling. Albumin also prevented autophagy by sustaining mTORC1. These results indicate an anti-oxidative role for albumin via preventing NOX/ROS-mediated mitochondrial signaling to stimulate apoptosis as well as autophagy. Autophagy, initially induced by canonical inhibition of mTORC1 and enhanced by non-canonical mitochondrial damage, acts physically as a pro-survival mechanism.","['Liu, Shu-Yu', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Yang, Tsan-Tzu', 'Huang, Wei-Ching', 'Hsieh, Chia-Yuan', 'Shen, Wan-Jou', 'Tsai, Tsung-Ting', 'Shieh, Chi-Chang', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Liu SY', 'Chen CL', 'Yang TT', 'Huang WC', 'Hsieh CY', 'Shen WJ', 'Tsai TT', 'Shieh CC', 'Lin CF']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*toxicity', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-012-0758-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Nov;17(11):1156-69. doi: 10.1007/s10495-012-0758-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide-loaded NLCs were prepared by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method followed by probe sonication. Chemical coupling of NLCs with Tf was mediated by an amide linkage between the surface-exposed amino group of the fatty amine and the carboxyl group of the protein. The physical coating was performed in a Ringer-Hepes buffer medium. NLCs were characterized by their particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, drug entrapment percentage, drug release profiles and Tf-coupling efficiency. The cytotoxicity of NLCs on K562 acute myelogenous leukaemia cells was studied by MTT assay, and their cellular uptake was studied by a flow cytometry method. SA-containing NLCs showed the lowest particle size, the highest zeta potential and the largest coupling efficiency values. The drug entrapment percentage and the zeta potential decreased after Tf coupling, but the average particle size increased. SP-containing formulations released their drug contents comparatively slower than SA- or DA-containing NLCs. Unconjugated NLCs released moderately more drug than Tf-NLCs. Flow cytometry studies revealed enhanced cellular uptake of Tf-NLCs compared to unconjugated ones. Blocking Tf receptors resulted in a significantly higher cell survival rate for Tf-NLCs. The highest cytotoxic activity was observed in the chemically coupled SA-containing nanoparticles, with an IC(50) value of 15-fold lower than free etoposide.","['Khajavinia, Amir', 'Varshosaz, Jaleh', 'Dehkordi, Abbas Jafarian']","['Khajavinia A', 'Varshosaz J', 'Dehkordi AJ']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Centre, Department of Pharmaceutics Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,England,Nanotechnology,Nanotechnology,101241272,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Transferrin)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FFV58UNY7O (stearylamine)', 'YWY9OD6A2K (dodecylamine)']",IM,"['Amines/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Liberation', 'Etoposide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Nanoconjugates/chemistry', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/*chemistry']",2012/09/18 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0957-4484/23/40/405101 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanotechnology. 2012 Oct 12;23(40):405101. doi: 10.1088/0957-4484/23/40/405101.

In this study we report the survival of patients with myeloid malignancies, classified by updated criteria, in Europe. We analyzed 58,800 cases incident between 1995 to 2002 in 48 population-based cancer registries from 20 European countries, classified into HAEMACARE myeloid malignancy groupings. The period approach was used to estimate 5-year relative survival in 2000-2002. The relative overall survival rate was 37%, but varied significantly between the major groups: being 17% for acute myeloid leukemia, 20% for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, 31% for myelodysplastic syndromes and 63% for myeloproliferative neoplasms. Survival of patients with individual disease entities ranged from 90% for those with essential thrombocythemia to 4% for those with acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia. Regional European variations in survival were conspicuous for myeloproliferative neoplasms, with survival rates being lowest in Eastern Europe. This is the first paper to present large-scale, European survival data for patients with myeloid malignancies using prognosis-based groupings of entities defined by the third revision of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology/World Health Organization classifications. Poor survival in some parts of Europe, particularly for treatable diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia, is of concern for hematologists and public health authorities.","['Maynadie, Marc', 'De Angelis, Roberta', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Visser, Otto', 'Allemani, Claudia', 'Tereanu, Carmen', 'Capocaccia, Riccardo', 'Giacomin, Adriano', 'Lutz, Jean-Michel', 'Martos, Carmen', 'Sankila, Risto', 'Johannesen, Tom Borge', 'Simonetti, Arianna', 'Sant, Milena']","['Maynadie M', 'De Angelis R', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Visser O', 'Allemani C', 'Tereanu C', 'Capocaccia R', 'Giacomin A', 'Lutz JM', 'Martos C', 'Sankila R', 'Johannesen TB', 'Simonetti A', 'Sant M']","[""Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Cote d'Or, EA 4184, Universite de Bourgogne; Service d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU de Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*embryology/mortality', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.064014 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.064014 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Feb;98(2):230-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.064014.

Whereas these subgroups are known to play an important role in outcome in first complete remission, and also in the indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, data are limited on their role after transplantation in advanced disease. To evaluate the role of molecular subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype after allogeneic stem cell transplantation beyond first complete remission, we analyzed the data from 141 consecutive adults (median age: 51.0 years, range 18.4-69.3 years) who had received an allogeneic transplant either in primary induction failure or beyond first complete remission. A sequential regimen of cytoreductive chemotherapy (fludarabine, high-dose AraC, amsacrine) followed by reduced intensity conditioning (FLAMSA-RIC), was uniformly used for conditioning. After a median follow up of three years, overall survival from transplantation was 64 +/- 4%, 53 +/- 4% and 44 +/- 5% at one, two and four years, respectively. Forty patients transplanted in primary induction failure achieved an encouraging 2-year survival of 69%. Among 101 patients transplanted beyond first complete remission, 2-year survival was 81% among patients with the NPM1(mut)/FLT3(wt) genotype in contrast to 43% in other genotypes. Higher numbers of transfused CD34(+) cells (hazard ratio 2.155, 95% confidence interval 0.263-0.964, P=0.039) and favorable genotype (hazard ratio 0.142, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.898, P=0.048) were associated with superior overall survival in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype can frequently be rescued after primary induction failure by allogeneic transplantation following FLAMSA-RIC. The prognostic role of NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD based subgroups was carried through after allogeneic stem cell transplantation beyond first complete remission.","['Pfeiffer, Tim', 'Schleuning, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Haude, Karl-Heinz', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Buchholz, Stefanie', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Meyer, Ralf G', 'Greinix, Hildegard', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Braess, Jan', 'Schlimok, Gunter', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Schmid, Christoph']","['Pfeiffer T', 'Schleuning M', 'Mayer J', 'Haude KH', 'Tischer J', 'Buchholz S', 'Bunjes D', 'Bug G', 'Holler E', 'Meyer RG', 'Greinix H', 'Scheid C', 'Christopeit M', 'Schnittger S', 'Braess J', 'Schlimok G', 'Spiekermann K', 'Ganser A', 'Kolb HJ', 'Schmid C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinikum Augsburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120914,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.070235 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.070235 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):518-25. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.070235.

Previous comparisons of autologous versus allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation noted higher relapse, but lower treatment-related mortality though using bone marrow grafts, with treatment-related mortality of 12-20%. Recognizing lower treatment-related mortality using autologous peripheral blood grafts, in an analysis of registry data from the Center for International Blood and Transplant Research, we compared treatment-related mortality, relapse, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission (median ages 36-44, range 19-60) receiving myeloablative HLA-matched sibling donor grafts (bone marrow, n=475 or peripheral blood, n=428) versus autologous peripheral blood (n=230). The 5-year cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality was 19% (95% confidence interval, 16-23%), 20% (17-24%) and 8% (5-12%) for allogeneic bone marrow, allogeneic peripheral blood and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant recipients, respectively. The corresponding figures for 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse were 20% (17-24%), 26% (21-30%) and 45% (38-52%), respectively. At 5 years, leukemia-free survival and overall survival rates were similar: allogeneic bone marrow 61% (56-65%) and 64% (59-68%); allogeneic peripheral blood 54% (49-59%) and 59% (54-64%); autologous peripheral blood 47% (40-54%) and 54% (47-60%); P=0.13 and P=0.19, respectively. In multivariate analysis the incidence of treatment-related mortality was lower after autologous peripheral blood transplantation than after allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood transplants [relative risk 0.37 (0.20-0.69); P=0.001], but treatment failure (death or relapse) after autologous peripheral blood was significantly more likely [relative risk 1.32 (1.06-1.64); P=0.011]. The 5-year overall survival, however, was similar in patients who received autologous peripheral blood (n=230) [relative risk 1.23 (0.98-1.55); P=0.071] or allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood (n=903).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, a disease phase-specific variability in the p53 mutation profile and function takes place, and both analyses could be useful to guide treatment choices.","['Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Di Maio, Valeria', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Raponi, Sara', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Marinelli M', 'Peragine N', 'Di Maio V', 'Chiaretti S', 'De Propris MS', 'Raponi S', 'Tavolaro S', 'Mauro FR', 'Del Giudice I', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/radiation effects', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.069906 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.069906 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Mar;98(3):371-5. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.069906.

Here, we examined the antitumor activity and drug targets of bortezomib in leukemia cells. Human leukemia cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Drug efficacy was evaluated by apoptosis assays and associated molecular events assessed by Western Blot. Gene silencing was performed by small interference RNA. Drug was tested in vivo in xenograft models of human leukemia cell lines and in primary leukemia cells. Clinical samples were assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Bortezomib differentially induced apoptosis in leukemia cells that was independent of its proteasome inhibition. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, a cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, mediated the apoptotic effect of bortezomib. Bortezomib increased protein phosphatase 2A activity in sensitive leukemia cells (HL-60 and KG-1), but not in resistant cells (MOLT-3 and K562). Bortezomib's downregulation of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A and phospho-Akt correlated with its drug sensitivity. Furthermore, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A negatively regulated protein phosphatase 2A activity. Ectopic expression of CIP2A up-regulated phospho-Akt and protected HL-60 cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing CIP2A overcame the resistance to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MOLT3 and K562 cells. Importantly, bortezomib exerted in vivo antitumor activity in HL-60 xenografted tumors and induced cell death in some primary leukemic cells. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A was expressed in leukemic blasts from bone marrow samples. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A plays a major role in mediating bortezomib-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells.","['Liu, Chun-Yu', 'Shiau, Chung-Wai', 'Kuo, Hsin-Yu', 'Huang, Hsiang-Po', 'Chen, Ming-Huang', 'Tzeng, Cheng-Hwai', 'Chen, Kuen-Feng']","['Liu CY', 'Shiau CW', 'Kuo HY', 'Huang HP', 'Chen MH', 'Tzeng CH', 'Chen KF']","['Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang-Ming Universit, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CIP2A protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autoantigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.050187 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.050187 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 May;98(5):729-38. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.050187.

However, there are no recommendations to guide diagnosis and management. The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia assigned experts in hematology and infectious diseases to develop evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis. The guidelines were developed using the evidence criteria set forth by the American Infectious Diseases Society and the key recommendations are summarized here. In the absence of validated biomarkers, the diagnosis of mucormycosis relies on histology and/or detection of the organism by culture from involved sites with identification of the isolate at the species level (no grading). Antifungal chemotherapy, control of the underlying predisposing condition, and surgery are the cornerstones of management (level A II). Options for first-line chemotherapy of mucormycosis include liposomal amphotericin B and amphotericin B lipid complex (level B II). Posaconazole and combination therapy of liposomal amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex with caspofungin are the options for second line-treatment (level B II). Surgery is recommended for rhinocerebral and skin and soft tissue disease (level A II). Reversal of underlying risk factors (diabetes control, reversal of neutropenia, discontinuation/taper of glucocorticosteroids, reduction of immunosuppressants, discontinuation of deferroxamine) is important in the treatment of mucormycosis (level A II). The duration of antifungal chemotherapy is not defined but guided by the resolution of all associated symptoms and findings (no grading). Maintenance therapy/secondary prophylaxis must be considered in persistently immunocompromised patients (no grading).","['Skiada, Anna', 'Lanternier, Fanny', 'Groll, Andreas H', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Zimmerli, Stephan', 'Herbrecht, Raoul', 'Lortholary, Olivier', 'Petrikkos, George L']","['Skiada A', 'Lanternier F', 'Groll AH', 'Pagano L', 'Zimmerli S', 'Herbrecht R', 'Lortholary O', 'Petrikkos GL']","['Department of Propaedeutic Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Review']",20120914,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Evidence-Based Practice/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Mucormycosis/complications/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative/methods']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.065110 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.065110 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):492-504. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.065110.

Here genome-wide analysis revealed that both ERG and FLI1 occupy similar genomic regions as AML1-ETO in t(8;21) AMLs and identified ERG/FLI1 as proteins that facilitate binding of oncofusion protein complexes. In addition, we demonstrate that ERG and FLI1 bind the RUNX1 promoter and that shRNA-mediated silencing of ERG leads to reduced expression of RUNX1 and AML1-ETO, consistent with a role of ERG in transcriptional activation of these proteins. Finally, we identify H3 acetylation as the epigenetic mark preferentially associated with ETS factor binding. This intimate connection between ERG/FLI1 binding and H3 acetylation implies that one of the molecular strategies of oncofusion proteins, such as AML1-ETO and PML-RAR-alpha, involves the targeting of histone deacetylase activities to ERG/FLI1 bound hematopoietic regulatory sites. Together, these results highlight the dual importance of ETS factors in t(8;21) leukemogenesis, both as transcriptional regulators of the oncofusion protein itself as well as proteins that facilitate AML1-ETO binding.","['Martens, Joost H A', 'Mandoli, Amit', 'Simmer, Femke', 'Wierenga, Bart-Jan', 'Saeed, Sadia', 'Singh, Abhishek A', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G']","['Martens JH', 'Mandoli A', 'Simmer F', 'Wierenga BJ', 'Saeed S', 'Singh AA', 'Altucci L', 'Vellenga E', 'Stunnenberg HG']","['Radboud University, Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53882-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-429050 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 8;120(19):4038-48. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-429050.

Recent studies in mice have shown that stimulation of NK cells with cytokines or in the context of a viral infection results in memory-like properties. We hypothesized that human NK cells exhibit such memory-like properties with an enhanced recall response after cytokine preactivation. In the present study, we show that human NK cells preactivated briefly with cytokine combinations including IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 followed by a 7- to 21-day rest have enhanced IFN-gamma production after restimulation with IL-12 + IL-15, IL-12 + IL-18, or K562 leukemia cells. This memory-like phenotype was retained in proliferating NK cells. In CD56(dim) NK cells, the memory-like IFN-gamma response was correlated with the expression of CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, and CD69 and a lack of CD57 and KIR. Therefore, human NK cells have functional memory-like properties after cytokine activation, which provides a novel rationale for integrating preactivation with combinations of IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 into NK cell immunotherapy strategies.","['Romee, Rizwan', 'Schneider, Stephanie E', 'Leong, Jeffrey W', 'Chase, Julie M', 'Keppel, Catherine R', 'Sullivan, Ryan P', 'Cooper, Megan A', 'Fehniger, Todd A']","['Romee R', 'Schneider SE', 'Leong JW', 'Chase JM', 'Keppel CR', 'Sullivan RP', 'Cooper MA', 'Fehniger TA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-18)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-18/immunology/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/immunology/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-12/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-18/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49871-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-419283 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 6;120(24):4751-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-419283.

We performed a systematic review of literature to assess the strength and consistency of associations. METHODS: We summarized published literature in the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine during 1966-2012. Literature was categorized according to study design and population: industrial cohort studies, professional cohort studies, and population-based case-control studies. RESULTS: Findings from occupational cohort and population-based case-control studies were very inconsistent for LHM, including myeloid leukemia. Apart from some isolated exceptions, relative risks were close to the null, and there was little evidence for dose-response relations for any of the LHM. CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no consistent or strong epidemiologic evidence that formaldehyde is causally related to any of the LHM. The absence of established toxicological mechanisms further weakens any arguments for causation. To be informative, future epidemiologic research should improve on formaldehyde exposure assessment and apply modern diagnostic schemes for specific LHM.","['Checkoway, Harvey', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Mundt, Diane J', 'Mundt, Kenneth A']","['Checkoway H', 'Boffetta P', 'Mundt DJ', 'Mundt KA']","['Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Medicine, University of Washington, Box 357234, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. checko@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20120915,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'Formaldehyde poisoning']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Formaldehyde/adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Respiratory Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0055-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Nov;23(11):1747-66. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0055-2.

Morphological examination of such biopsies requires knowledge of the composition of normal bone marrow and its variations, such as age-related changes. Diagnostic problems may arise due to poor specimen quality, insufficient sections or stainings and insufficient experience with reactive bone marrow changes which occasionally resemble neoplastic disorders. Reactive bone marrow processes can affect one or more hematopoietic cell lines, lead to disruption of the normal architecture and specifically affect the bone marrow stroma. Optimal bone marrow diagnosis requires adequately stained slides and, when needed, immunophenotyping and molecular examinations. Furthermore, rather than biopsy interpretation of other organs, pathologists routinely need clinical history information for correct interpretation and diagnosis of bone marrow changes. In this article, the normal features of bone marrow as well as the most frequent reactive bone marrow alterations are described.","['Tzankov, A', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Beham-Schmid, C']","['Tzankov A', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Beham-Schmid C']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Universitatsspital Basel, Schoenbeinstr 40, 4031 Basel, Schweiz. atzankov@uhbs.ch']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Necrosis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00292-012-1649-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2012 Nov;33(6):496-507. doi: 10.1007/s00292-012-1649-x.,,,,,,,Normales Knochenmark und haufige reaktive Veranderungen.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, AHSP expression was limited to physiological nucleated erythroid precursors (EPs) and blasts in erythroid leukemias. Although CD71 also stained EPs, it additionally stained nonerythroid malignant cells to varying extents in acute leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, metastatic carcinomas, and small round blue cell tumors.

We retrospectively studied 150 patients with AML and diagnostic cytogenetic abnormalities who underwent myeloablative allo-HSCT while in first complete remission to evaluate the prognostic impact of persistent cytogenetic abnormalities at allo-HSCT. Three risk groups were identified. Patients with favorable/intermediate cytogenetics at diagnosis (n = 49) and patients with unfavorable cytogenetics at diagnosis but without a persistent abnormal clone at allo-HSCT (n = 83) had a similar 3-year leukemia-free survival of 58%-60% despite the higher 3-year relapse incidence (RI) in the latter group (32.3%, versus 16.8% in the former group).

Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine from the IL-6 family that modulates proliferation and differentiation in numerous cells. The basis for inhibition versus induction of proliferation by this cytokine is obscure, although MYC was described as a potent molecular switch in OSM signaling. We show herein that, in contrast to osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas, for which OSM was cytostatic, OSM induced proliferation of ES cell lines. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that growth induction by OSM depends on both types I [leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)] and II [OSM receptor (OSMR)] receptors, high STAT3 activation, and induction of MYC to a high expression level. Indeed, ES cell lines, mice xenografts, and patient biopsy specimens poorly expressed LIF, precluding LIFR lysosomal degradation and OSMR transcriptional induction, thus leading to a high LIFR/OSMR ratio. Because other neuroectodermic tumors (ie, glioma, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma) had a similar expression profile, the main role of EWS-FLI1 could be through maintenance of stemness and neuroectodermic features, characterized by a low LIF, a high LIFR/OSMR ratio, and high MYC expression.

DNA binding of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TAL1/SCL, is required for normal erythropoiesis. A link between elevated TAL1 and excessive erythrocytosis is suggested by erythroid progenitor cells from a patient that exhibits unusually high sensitivity to erythropoietin with concomitantly elevated TAL1 and EPO-R expression. We found that TAL1 regulates EPO-R expression mediated via three conserved E-box binding motifs (CAGCTG) in the EPO-R 5' untranslated transcribed region. TAL1 increases association of the GATA-1.TAL1.LMO2.LDB1 transcription activation complex to the region that includes the transcription start site and the 5' GATA and 3' E-box motifs flanking the EPO-R transcription start site suggesting that TAL1 promotes accessibility of this region. Nucleosome shifting has been demonstrated to facilitate TAL1 but not GATA-1 binding to regulate target gene expression. Accordingly, we observed that with induced expression of EPO-R in hemotopoietic progenitor cells, nucleosome phasing shifts to increase the linker region containing the EPO-R transcription start site and TAL1 binds to the flanking 5' GATA and 3' E-box regions of the promoter. These data suggest that TAL1 binds to the EPO-R promoter to activate EPO-R expression and provides a potential link to elevated EPO-R expression leading to hypersensitivity to erythropoietin and the resultant excessive erythrocytosis.","['Rogers, Heather', 'Wang, Li', 'Yu, Xiaobing', 'Alnaeeli, Mawadda', 'Cui, Kairong', 'Zhao, Keji', 'Bieker, James J', 'Prchal, Josef', 'Huang, Suming', 'Weksler, Babette', 'Noguchi, Constance Tom']","['Rogers H', 'Wang L', 'Yu X', 'Alnaeeli M', 'Cui K', 'Zhao K', 'Bieker JJ', 'Prchal J', 'Huang S', 'Weksler B', 'Noguchi CT']","['Molecular Medicine Branch, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1822, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120916,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (EPO protein, human)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.5 (Luciferases, Renilla)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases, Renilla/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Polycythemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62476-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.378398 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Oct 26;287(44):36720-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.378398.

Suppression of GVHD is associated with the unwanted diminishment of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response. The aim of this study was to maintain the benefits of GVL during GVHD suppression through isolated blockade of T-cell migration factors. To this end, we developed a murine model of B-cell leukemia, which was treated with BMT to induce GVHD. Within this model, functional blockade of MIP-2/CXCR2 was analyzed by observing proteomic, histologic and clinical variables of GVHD manifestation. Luminex assay of collected tissue identified several cytokines [granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and interleukin-23 (IL-23)] that were upregulated during GHVD, but reduced by neutralizing the MIP-2/CXCR2 axis. In addition, donor T-cell blockade of CXCR2 combined with recipient administration of anti-MIP-2 caused a significant decrease in GVHD while preserving the GVL response. We propose that blocking the MIP-2/CXCR2 axis represents a novel strategy to separate the toxicity of GVHD from the beneficial effects of GVL after allogenic BMT.","['Cho, Kyung-Ah', 'Woo, So-Youn', 'Park, Yoon Shin', 'Park, Min Hwa', 'Ryu, Kyung-Ha']","['Cho KA', 'Woo SY', 'Park YS', 'Park MH', 'Ryu KH']","['Department of Microbiology, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Ewha Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120906,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Chemokine CXCL2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01694-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.126 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Oct 5;426(4):558-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.126.

Emerging clinical and experimental evidence also indicates Wnt signaling involvement in the disruption of the latter balance in hematologic malignancies, where the stromal microenvironment favors the homing of cancer cells to the bone marrow, as well as leukemia stem cell development and chemoresistance.

However, its expression patterns in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are controversial according to previous studies. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the expression and clinical significance of miR-29a in pediatric AML. METHODS: Expression levels of miR-29a in bone marrow mononuclear cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR in a cohort of 106 patients with newly diagnosed pediatric AML. The prognostic values of miR-29a in pediatric AML were also analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, we demonstrated a significantly decreased expression of miR-29a in the bone marrow of pediatric AML patients (P<0.001). The expression levels of miR-29a were significantly lower in French-American-British classification subtype M7 than in other subtypes (P<0.001) and differed significantly across cytogenetic risk groups (P=0.002) with high miR-29a expression among those with favorable karyotypes. Moreover, low miR-29a expression was significantly associated with shorter relapse-free (P<0.001) and overall (P=0.008) survival in pediatric AML patients. Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis of the univariate predictors identified cytogenetic risk and miR-29a expression as independent prognostic factors for relapse-free survival and overall survival. More interestingly, the prognostic value of miR-29a expression was more obvious in the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate for the first time that the down-regulation of miR-29a was associated with advanced clinical features and poor prognosis of pediatric AML patients, suggesting that miR-29a down-regulation may be used as an unfavorable prognostic marker in pediatric AML.","['Zhu, Conglong', 'Wang, Yeguo', 'Kuai, Wenxia', 'Sun, Xingzhen', 'Chen, Huaiping', 'Hong, Ze']","['Zhu C', 'Wang Y', 'Kuai W', 'Sun X', 'Chen H', 'Hong Z']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, Jiangsu 223300, PR China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120912,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,"['0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reference Values', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(12)00510-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2013 Jan;46(1-2):49-53. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.09.002.

We determined IDO activity and expression in 49 patients with CLL. We found that IDO activity is increased in CLL. This may have some influence on CLL progression. BACKGROUND: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of tryptophan, suppressing T-cell activity. IDO activity and expression are increased in many malignant diseases, including hematological malignancies. IDO expression can mediate immunotolerance to tumors. IDO activity and expression have not previously been studied in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: We measured IDO activity by calculating the kynurenine-tryptophan (kyn-trp) ratio. IDO and IDO2 gene expression was determined by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: In patients with CLL, the serum kyn-trp ratio--reflecting increased IDO activity--was significantly higher compared with controls, but in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)--mainly representing malignant B cells--the expression of genes encoding IDO and IDO2 enzymes was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Increased IDO activity in patients with CLL may affect disease progression, although it originates from cells other than malignant B cells.","['Lindstrom, Vesa', 'Aittoniemi, Janne', 'Jylhava, Juulia', 'Eklund, Carita', 'Hurme, Mikko', 'Paavonen, Timo', 'Oja, Simo S', 'Itala-Remes, Maija', 'Sinisalo, Marjatta']","['Lindstrom V', 'Aittoniemi J', 'Jylhava J', 'Eklund C', 'Hurme M', 'Paavonen T', 'Oja SS', 'Itala-Remes M', 'Sinisalo M']","['Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. vesa.lindstrom@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (IDO2 protein, human)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '343-65-7 (Kynurenine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/biosynthesis/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kynurenine/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Tryptophan/blood']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00126-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Oct;12(5):363-5. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.06.001.

BN is an administrative region in the North-West of France, composed of three departments: Calvados, Manche and Orne. We extracted data from the Registre regional des hemopathies malignes de Basse-Normandie, a French registry which belongs to the Association of the French Cancer Registries (Francim). METHODS: All the HM were coded using the third edition of the International classification for oncologic diseases (ICD-O-3). We compared the clinical and biological descriptive data in patients less than 15 years old to those of young adults (15-24 years old). RESULTS: A total of 305 new cases of HM were recorded over the period 1997 to 2005. HM were more frequent in men (168 cases) than in women (137 cases). Patients less than 25 years old accounted for 4.1% of all HM cases, whereas patients less than 15 years old and young adults (15-24 years old) represented 2.2% and 1.9% of all cases, respectively. In patients less than 25 years old, the overall world-standardized incidence rates (WSR) were 7.67/100,000 (95% CI: 6.31-9.04) in BN (8.08 [6.15-10.02] for men and 7.24 [5.31-9.17] for women). In patients less than 15years, the overall WSR was 7.38/100,000 (6.23-8.52), with no difference between boys (7.57) and girls (7.17). Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was the most frequent HM, WSR=4.02/100,000 (3.16-4.88) (4.30 [3.08-5.53] in men, 3.73 [2.52-4.93] in women), with similar clinical and biological criteria between patients less than 15 years and young adults. In young adults, the overall WSR was 8.21/100,000 (7.47-8.96), similar between men and women (9.02 [7.93-10.12] and 7.37 [6.35-8.38], respectively). Their highest WSR was obtained for Hodgkin lymphomas (HL): 3.37/100,000 (2.89-3.85), similar between men (3.49 [2.8-4.17]) and women (3.25 [2.58-3.93]). The study did not show any significant difference between the Calvados, Manche and Orne departments (except for HL, which seems more frequent in Manche department for 15-24 years old cases). There was no evidence of an increased risk for ALL in the subdistricts Beaumont-Hague and Les Pieux, which respectively have a nuclear waste reprocessing plant and a nuclear power plant on their territory. The subtype of HM was dependent on age whereas clinical and biological data were the same, whatever the age. CONCLUSION: These results contribute to HM monitoring in an area where the nuclear industry is present and to improve the organization and follow-up of medical care.","['Collignon, A', 'Duchenet, V', 'Mouchel, D', 'Malet, M', 'Cornet, E', 'Troussard, X']","['Collignon A', 'Duchenet V', 'Mouchel D', 'Malet M', 'Cornet E', 'Troussard X']","['Registre regional des hemopathies malignes de Basse-Normandie (RRHMBN), Basse-Normandie, Caen, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20120913,France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Nuclear Power Plants/statistics & numerical data', 'Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0398-7620(12)00559-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.respe.2012.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 2012 Oct;60(5):343-53. doi: 10.1016/j.respe.2012.03.004.

Next, knocking down DRAM-1 in NB4 APL cells was sufficient to impair neutrophil differentiation. Given that DRAM-1 is a transcriptional target of p53, we tested if DRAM-1 is regulated by the p53 relative p73. Indeed, inhibiting p73 prevented neutrophil differentiation and DRAM-1 induction of NB4 cells. In conclusion, we show for the first time that p73-regulated DRAM-1 is functionally involved in neutrophil differentiation of APL cells.","['Humbert, Magali', 'Mueller, Chantal', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Tschan, Mario P']","['Humbert M', 'Mueller C', 'Fey MF', 'Tschan MP']","['Experimental Oncology/Hematology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DRAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Autophagy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00357-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.08.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Dec;36(12):1552-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.08.024.

The Argentinean Oncopaediatric Registry (ROHA) has been active since 2000. Data for 2000-2008 are described in the present work. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ROHA is fed from a network of paediatric units and population-based cancer registries. Cases are coded by the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. RESULTS: A total of 11447 children aged 0-14 diagnosed with cancer were reported. Histologically verified cases and cases identified only through death certificates were respectively 91% and 6%. The annual age of standardised incidence rate of all cancers was 128.5 per million. Proportions of leukaemia's, lymphoma's and Central Nervous System tumours were 37%, 13% and 18%. The distribution of rates of acute lymphatic leukaemia by the year of age showed a peak around age 3. Eighty percent of the patients are treated in public hospital and around 35% migrate for some of the treatment. Deaths within a month of diagnosis were 5% in 2000 and 3% in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer incidence in Argentina is somewhat lower than in North American and in Western European countries: the deficit is mainly due to tumours of the Central Nervous system and other solid tumours. Childhood cancer incidence did not show any tendency to increase. The possible excess of Hodgkin lymphoma in the Northeast region requires additional studies. Early deaths after diagnosis indicate an unsatisfactory state of the overall organisation of childhood cancer care. Data from ROHA are used for decision making at local and national levels.","['Moreno, Florencia', 'Loria, Dora', 'Abriata, Graciela', 'Terracini, Benedetto']","['Moreno F', 'Loria D', 'Abriata G', 'Terracini B']","['Argentinean Oncopediatric Registry, National Cancer Institute, Buenos Aires City, Argentina. roha@roha.org.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120912,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(12)00616-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2012.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2013 Jan;49(2):465-73. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2012.08.001.

METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the costs and benefits of alemtuzumab or conventional therapy based on their effects on quality of life of patients. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio incorporating costs per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over lifetime. Due to the limited data available, a large number of assumptions had to be made to construct the cost-utility model. One-way, multi-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the impact of these uncertainties. Expected values of perfect information were also calculated for four specific scenarios. RESULTS: Depending on different key assumptions made, the PSA suggested distinct conclusions using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 GBP per QALY gained. Using this threshold, the probability that alemtuzumab would be cost-effective varies from 0 percent to 53 percent for the four modeled scenarios. Population expected value of perfect information analysis suggests that resolving the parameter uncertainty in the analysis for people with T-PLL in the United Kingdom would have considerable value--up to 5.3 million euro. CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab appears more likely to be cost-effective if used earlier in the course of T-PLL and where it replaces the use of multiple alternative therapies. However, cost-effectiveness is highly uncertain and future research is clearly justified. Nevertheless, our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of considering the cost-effectiveness of an agent despite the presence of significant uncertainty to provide appropriate assessment information to policy makers.","['Lu, Lanting', 'Peters, Jaime', 'Roome, Chris', 'Stein, Ken']","['Lu L', 'Peters J', 'Roome C', 'Stein K']","['Unviersity of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom. lulanting@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,International journal of technology assessment in health care,8508113,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'England', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/02/09 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0266462312000244 [pii]', '10.1017/S0266462312000244 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2012 Jul;28(3):241-8. doi: 10.1017/S0266462312000244.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess the prognostic relevance of serum 25(OH)D concentrations in patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The study was carried out on 195 newly diagnosed patients (75 B-CLL and 120 NHL) as well as 30 normal healthy controls. For all patients and normal controls serum 25(OH)D concentrations were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in B-CLL and NHL patients as compared with normal controls (P = 0.00 for both). Also, there are significant associations between serum 25(OH)D levels and positive CD 38, positive ZAP 70 as well as Binet stages (chi(2) = 16.071, 16.644, 21.134 respectively; P = 0.00 for all) in the B-CLL patient group. Moreover, there are significant associations between serum 25(OH)D status and international prognostic index (IPI), performance status (chi(2) = 6.994, 9.212, P = 0.02, 0.01 respectively), but not with clinical stages (chi(2) = 3.115, P = 0.539) in NHL. Multivariate analysis revealed that 25(OH)D insufficiency is an independent poor prognostic factor in both B-CLL and NHL patient groups. In conclusion, 25(OH)D insufficiency is an independent poor prognostic factor in patients with B-CLL and NHL. 25(OH)D might be a therapeutic target in lymphoid malignancies.","['Aref, Salah', 'Ibrahim, Lamiaa', 'Azmy, Emaad']","['Aref S', 'Ibrahim L', 'Azmy E']","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University, Mansoura 3011, Egypt. salaharef@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120912,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '21343-40-8 (25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2)']",IM,"['25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2/*blood', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin D/blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/blood']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['hem56 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000025 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2013 Jan;18(1):20-5. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000025.

Novel agents and combination therapies have been investigated by several studies in both the upfront and relapsed setting, particularly for patients with 17p deletion, TP53 mutation and fludarabine-refractory CLL. While these agents and combination therapies have improved initial response rates, ongoing studies are continued to determine and improve the efficacy and safety. Despite advancements in the treatment of CLL have led to high response rates, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative option and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HSCT must be strongly considered whenever feasible. As such, ongoing studies of these agents and other novel approaches in clinical development are needed to expand and improve treatment options for CLL patients.","['Lu, Kang', 'Wang, Xin']","['Lu K', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, No, 324 Jingwu Road, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, P R China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120916,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-55 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-55 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 Sep 16;5:55. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-55.,PMC3465197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OPN is expressed and secreted by numerous human malignancies. CD44 play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. We aimed to evaluate serum levels of osteopontin and CD44 in patients with lymphorethicular malignancies in childhood. METHODS: We studied serum levels of CD44 and OPN levels of 54 patients (26, 18 and 10 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), respectively) at the diagnosis. RESULTS: The mean levels of OPN were significantly higher in patients (5.42+/-8.24 ng/ml) than in controls (3.89 +/-1.96 ng/ml). The mean levels of CD44 levels were also significantly higher in patients (3.82+/-2.31 ng/ml) than in controls (1.96+/-0.62 ng/ml), and significantly higher in the advanced stages than in early stages. The mean levels of the CD44 in NHL, HL and ALL were 3.49+/-2.00, 3.56+/-1.74, and 5.15+/-3.50 respectively. OPN and CD44 levels were found to be increased in parallel (p=0.003). A more advanced disease and/or poor prognostic factors were seen in 9 patients who had both serum CD44 and OPN levels higher than 2SD of the control. CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of both CD44 and OPN at the diagnosis may predict an unfavorable outcome in childhood leukemias and lymphomas (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 44).","['Elli, M', 'Dagdemir, A', 'Bozkurt, C', 'Pinarli, F G', 'Duzgun, A', 'Ozmen, Z C', 'Ertem, U', 'Acar, S']","['Elli M', 'Dagdemir A', 'Bozkurt C', 'Pinarli FG', 'Duzgun A', 'Ozmen ZC', 'Ertem U', 'Acar S']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey. ellimurat@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Bratisl Lek Listy,Bratislavske lekarske listy,0065324,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hodgkin Disease/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood', 'Osteopontin/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood']",2012/09/18 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/bll_2012_120 [doi]'],ppublish,Bratisl Lek Listy. 2012;113(9):534-8. doi: 10.4149/bll_2012_120.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidences of febrile neutropenia were 74.7% (59 of 79) in the MFLX group and 81.1% (219 of 270) in the TFLX group (log-rank test p = 0.044). Subgroup analysis revealed a more prominent prophylactic advantage of MFLX in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or long duration of neutropenia (p = 0.013 and 0.008, respectively).

We have investigated the expression pattern of neurotrophic signaling molecules in pregnancies complicated by elevated liver enzyme, and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). METHODS: Placentas from normal and pathological pregnancies were collected. Macroarray analysis was performed and the data were confirmed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Real-time PCR analyses (pathological vs. normal pregnancies) confirmed a significant down-regulation for IL-6, STAT3alpha, STAT3beta, and Bcl-2. The expression of Mcl-1 isoform 1 (long) was significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that decreased expression of IL-6 could mean that abnormalities in the immunological system function involve inflammatory cytokines other than IL-6 in examined pathological pregnancies. The STAT3alpha and STAT3beta down-regulation lead to a marked reduction of cellular transcriptional activity. Decreased expression of IL-6 is associated with a down-regulation of Bcl-2 but not of Mcl-1 isoform 1, suggesting that these two antiapoptotic proteins may function independently and that Mcl-1 may have a distinct role in controlling apoptotic pathway.","['Cecati, Monia', 'Sartini, Davide', 'Pozzi, Valentina', 'Giannubilo, Stefano R', 'Ferretti, Filippo', 'Stortoni, Piergiorgio', 'Saccucci, Franca', 'Tranquilli, Andrea L', 'Emanuelli, Monica']","['Cecati M', 'Sartini D', 'Pozzi V', 'Giannubilo SR', 'Ferretti F', 'Stortoni P', 'Saccucci F', 'Tranquilli AL', 'Emanuelli M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche Specialistiche ed Odontostomatologiche, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120920,England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HELLP Syndrome/*metabolism', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/14767058.2012.722713 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2013 Jan;26(1):26-31. doi: 10.3109/14767058.2012.722713.

The ectopic activity of DOT1L, associated with the chromosomal translocation that is a universal hallmark of MLL-rearranged leukemia, is a required driver of leukemogenesis in this malignancy. Here, we present studies on the structure-activity relationship of aminonucleoside-based DOT1L inhibitors. Within this series, we find that improvements in target enzyme affinity and selectivity are driven entirely by diminution of the dissociation rate constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex, leading to long residence times for the binary complex. The biochemical K(i) and residence times measured for these inhibitors correlate well with their effects on intracellular H3K79 methylation and MLL-rearranged leukemic cell killing. Crystallographic studies reveal a conformational adaptation mechanism associated with high-affinity inhibitor binding and prolonged residence time; these studies also suggest that conformational adaptation likewise plays a critical role in natural ligand interactions with the enzyme, hence, facilitating enzyme turnover. These results provide critical insights into the role of conformational adaptation in the enzymatic mechanism of catalysis and in pharmacologic intervention for DOT1L and other members of this enzyme class.","['Basavapathruni, Aravind', 'Jin, Lei', 'Daigle, Scott R', 'Majer, Christina R A', 'Therkelsen, Carly A', 'Wigle, Tim J', 'Kuntz, Kevin W', 'Chesworth, Richard', 'Pollock, Roy M', 'Scott, Margaret P', 'Moyer, Mikel P', 'Richon, Victoria M', 'Copeland, Robert A', 'Olhava, Edward J']","['Basavapathruni A', 'Jin L', 'Daigle SR', 'Majer CR', 'Therkelsen CA', 'Wigle TJ', 'Kuntz KW', 'Chesworth R', 'Pollock RM', 'Scott MP', 'Moyer MP', 'Richon VM', 'Copeland RA', 'Olhava EJ']","['Epizyme Inc., 325 Vassar Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121009,England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosides)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2012/09/18 06:00,2013/04/03 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cbdd.12050 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2012 Dec;80(6):971-80. doi: 10.1111/cbdd.12050.

The DEP device for cell manipulation comprised a microfluidic channel with an upper indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and a lower ITO-interdigitated band array (ITO-IDA) electrode modified with an antibody. Cells immediately accumulated on the surface in the gap area between both bands of the ITO-IDA electrode by n-DEP upon AC voltage between the upper ITO and both lower bands. Switching of the applied band electrode voltage resulted in the removal of accumulated cells to form another pattern because of the formation of a different electric field pattern in the device. Modifying the ITO-IDA surface with the antibody inhibited the removal of the cells with a specific surface antigen for irreversible capture by immunoreactions during the first accumulation. In this study, we targeted the CD33 surface antigen expressed on human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). The time required for the assay was substantially short: 60 s for forcing and 60 s for separating the unbound cells. Furthermore, the present method does not require pretreatment such as target labeling or washing of unbound cells. Moreover, the use of the swing technique considerably improved cell binding to the antibody-modified surface for cells with a specific surface antigen. The distinct integration of cells with n-DEP in the high conductivity medium provided higher cell binding efficiency compared to that obtained in our previous study (Hatanaka, H.; Yasukawa, T.; Mizutani, F.

METHODS: The model of ovarian cancer subcutaneous tumor was established in nude mice using platinum-resistant ovarian cancer line COC1/DDP. The mice were randomly divided into six groups, i. e., the high Chinese materia medica (CMM) group, the medium CMM group, the low CMM group, the cisplatin group (DDP), the combined treatment group (with DDP combined CMM), and the control group (with normal saline). The medication lasted for 3 successive weeks. The tumor weight and the tumor inhibition rate were calculated. The expressions of Bcl-associated x protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) were detected using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical assay. The ultra-structure of tumor cells was observed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: The tumor inhibition rate was the highest in the combined treatment group, being (59. 26 +/- 6.86) %, showing statistical difference when compared with the rest groups (P < 0.01). Results of RT-PCR showed the Bax mRNA expression was the highest in the combined treatment group and the lowest in the control group (P < 0.01). Anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 mRNA expression was the highest in the control group and the lowest in the high CMM group (P < 0.01). The Bcl-2 mRNA expression was lower in the combined treatment group than in the cisplatin group (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical results showed the Bax protein expression was the highest and the expression of Bcl-2 was the lowest in the combined treatment group, showing statistical difference when compared with the rest groups (P < 0.01). The middle- and late-stage manifestations of apoptosis could be seen in each CMM group and the combined treatment group under electron microscope. CONCLUSIONS: ZYR combined with chemotherapy could reverse the cisplatin-resistance of resistant ovarian cancer nude mice, and enhance its tumor inhibitory effect. Its mechanisms were correlated with up-regulating the expression of Bax, down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2, and promoting cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell apoptosis.","['Qi, Cong', 'Zhang, Qin-Hua', 'Li, Jiu-Xian']","['Qi C', 'Zhang QH', 'Li JX']","['Department of Gynecology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai. qicongxzq@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (zengmian yiliu)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Platinum/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2014/01/03 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2012 Jun;32(6):817-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The OA animal model was established by fixing right hind limbs with gypsum in 22 New Zealand rabbits. Of them, 2 original model rabbits were taken as the control group, while the rest 20 were randomly divided into a free running group and a sand treatment group, 10 in each group. The healthy side of the free running group was taken as the normal control group. The sand treatment was given to those in the sand treatment group for 20 days. The expressions of Caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax in the cartilage cells of rabbit knee joint were measured by immunohistochemical assay. The cell apoptosis of chondrocytes was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the positive cell number, the optical density (OD), the protein expressions of Caspase-3, Bax, and TUNEL were higher in the free running group and the sand treatment group (P < 0.01). Besides, they were obviously higher in the free running group than in the sand treatment group (P < 0.01). The positive cell number of Bcl-2 and OD value in the free running group and the sand treatment group were both lower than those of the normal control group (P < 0.01). The positive cell number was obviously higher in the sand treatment group than in the free running group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sand treatment could inhibit the expressions of Caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2, and TUNEL in the articular cartilage of rabbits' knee OA, which might be partial mechanisms for anti-inflammation of sand treatment.","['Wei, Rong', 'Mahemuti, Dilinaer', 'Hu, Han-Hua']","['Wei R', 'Mahemuti D', 'Hu HH']","['Department of Rheumatism, Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cartilage, Articular/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Chondrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional/*methods', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/09/18 06:00,2014/01/03 06:00,['2012/09/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2012 Jun;32(6):801-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study and treatment of CML has contributed pivotal advances to translational medicine and cancer therapy. The discovery that a single chromosomal abnormality, the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, is responsible for the etiology of this disease was a milestone for treating and understanding CML. Subsequently, CML became the first disease for which allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice. Currently, CML is one of the few diseases where treatment targeted against the chromosomal abnormality is the sole frontline therapy for newly diagnosed patients. The use of directed therapy for CML challenged disease monitoring during treatment and led to the development of definitions that document response and predict relapse sooner than the former routine methods. These methods relied on classical cytogenetics through molecular cytogenetics (FISH) and, finally, on molecular monitoring assays. This review discusses the laboratory tools used for diagnosing CML, for monitoring during treatment, and for assessing remission or relapse. The advantages and disadvantages of each test, the common definition of response levels, and the efforts to standardize molecular monitoring for CML patient management are discussed.","['Tohami, Tali', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Amariglio, Ninette']","['Tohami T', 'Nagler A', 'Amariglio N']","['Hematology Laboratory, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of As(2)O(3) on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and to explore its potential mechanisms. The MTT assay demonstrated that As(2)O(3) decreased the cellular viability of MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Morphological observation, the TUNEL assay and flow cytometric analysis revealed that apoptosis was involved in the process. An assay for caspase-3 activity suggested that the apoptosis was mediated through caspase-3 activation. Further investigation indicated that protein levels of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) were markedly downregulated by As(2)O(3). Taken together, the results indicate that arsenic trioxide induces the apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells at least in part through the activation of caspase-3 and the decrease in HERG expression.","['Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Yang, Lei', 'Cai, Benzhi', 'Li, Jianping', 'Zhou, You', 'Yin, Li', 'Yang, Lili', 'Yang, Bao Feng', 'Lu, Yan Jie']","['Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang L', 'Cai B', 'Li J', 'Zhou Y', 'Yin L', 'Yang L', 'Yang BF', 'Lu YJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine and Pharmaceutics, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110308,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,2011/05/01 00:00,2011/05/01 00:01,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2011.224 [doi]', 'etm-02-03-0481 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2011 May;2(3):481-486. doi: 10.3892/etm.2011.224.

One month after infection, the provirus was detected in most organs of the mice infected intraperitoneally, and substantial proviral loads were detected in the peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. In contrast, the mice infected intravenously and orally showed low proviral loads, and the provirus distribution was limited to the spinal cord among the intravenously inoculated mice and to the liver among the perorally inoculated mice. Mice infected intraperitoneally also exhibited higher interleukin-2 production than the mice infected intravenously or orally, or than the uninfected control mice, while anti-HTLV-1 antibody titers were comparable between the mice infected intraperitoneally and intravenously.

As commonly altered genomic regions point to candidate genes involved in leukemogenesis, we used microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism profiling data of 391 AML cases to further narrow down genomic regions of interest. Targeted resequencing of 1000 genes located in the critical regions was performed in a representative cohort of 50 AML samples comprising all major cytogenetic subgroups. We identified 120 missense/nonsense mutations as well as 60 insertions/deletions affecting 73 different genes ( approximately 3.6 tumor-specific aberrations/AML). While most of the newly identified alterations were nonrecurrent, we observed an enrichment of mutations affecting genes involved in epigenetic regulation including known candidates like TET2, TET1, DNMT3A, and DNMT1, as well as mutations in the histone methyltransferases NSD1, EZH2, and MLL3. Furthermore, we found mutations in the splicing factor SFPQ and in the nonclassic regulators of mRNA processing CTCF and RAD21.

One such cytokine, IL-21, promotes the growth of myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells while inducing apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, the biologic significance of IL-21 has not been examined in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), a B-cell lymphoma characterized by elevated serum IgM and a lymphoplasmacytic bone marrow infiltrate. We report here on the presence of IL-21 in the bone marrow of patients with WM and have identified activated T cells as the source of this cytokine. We readily detected the IL-21 receptor on malignant WM B cells and show that IL-21 significantly increases both IgM secretion and cellular proliferation of these cells with no effect on viability. IL-21 rapidly induces phosphorylation of STAT3 in WM cells, and treatment of the WM cell line MWCL-1 with a STAT3 inhibitor abolished the IL-21-mediated increases in cellular proliferation and IgM secretion. IL-21 also increased the expression of known STAT3 targets involved in B-cell differentiation, including BLIMP-1, XBP-1, IL-6, and IL-10. Overall, our data indicate that IL-21 in the bone marrow microenvironment significantly affects the biology of WM tumor cells through a STAT3-dependent mechanism.","['Hodge, Lucy S', 'Ziesmer, Steve C', 'Yang, Zhi Zhang', 'Secreto, Frank J', 'Gertz, Morie A', 'Novak, Anne J', 'Ansell, Stephen M']","['Hodge LS', 'Ziesmer SC', 'Yang ZZ', 'Secreto FJ', 'Gertz MA', 'Novak AJ', 'Ansell SM']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120913,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukins)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/01/03 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46212-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-419440 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 1;120(18):3774-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-419440.

We investigated the NQO1 and PON1 polymorphisms for associations with susceptibility to childhood leukemia. METHODS: Samples from 1,027 Brazilian children (519 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL; 107 acute myeloid leukemia, AML; 401 controls) were analyzed. TaqMAN real-time assays were used to determine the NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T), PON1 rs662 (Q192R), and PON1 rs854560 (L55M) frequencies. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of polymorphisms with cases and controls, with age and somatic fusion genes (MLL-r and ETV6-RUNX1) as covariables. RESULTS: Children with at least one NQO1 variant allele were at lower risk for developing infant AML (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10-0.68); no association was detected for ALL. PON1 rs854560 (L55M) was associated with an increased risk of developing childhood leukemia (LM + MM, OR 1.93, 95 % CI 1.32-2.81). The PON1 rs662 R192R genotype had a statistically significant decreased frequency in ALL (OR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.43-0.93). Infant ALL cases were more likely to harbor homozygous PON1 rs854560 alleles than controls (OR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.03-2.89); at least one M allele was associated with an increased risk of ALL in children older than 1 year (OR 1.99, 95 % CI 1.17-3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T), PON1 rs854560 (L55M), and PON1 rs662 (Q192R) polymorphisms modified risk depending on leukemia subtype (decreased in AML, increased and decreased in ALL, respectively), age strata, and variant genotype combinations.","['de Aguiar Goncalves, Bruno Alves', 'Vasconcelos, Gisele M', 'Thuler, Luiz Claudio Santos', 'Andrade, Camilla', 'Faro, Alessandra', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'de Camargo, Beatriz', 'Bernstain, Luna', 'Neves, Cynthia Curvello', 'Agareno, Jozina Maria de Andrade', 'de Carvalho, Lilian Maria Burlacchini', 'Araujo, Flavia Nogueira Serafim', 'de Brito, Nilma Pimentel', 'Magalhaes, Isis Q', 'Cordoba, Jose Carlos', 'Pimenta, Flavia', 'Gadelha, Andreia', 'Cartaxo, Eloisa', 'Basegio, Rosania Maria', 'Mnayarji, Atalla', 'Souza, Marcelo S', 'Arencibia, Alejandro', 'Melaragno, Renato', 'Coser, Virginia Maria', 'Lafayete, Thereza Christina', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['de Aguiar Goncalves BA', 'Vasconcelos GM', 'Thuler LC', 'Andrade C', 'Faro A', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Emerenciano M', 'de Camargo B', 'Bernstain L', 'Neves CC', 'Agareno JM', 'de Carvalho LM', 'Araujo FN', 'de Brito NP', 'Magalhaes IQ', 'Cordoba JC', 'Pimenta F', 'Gadelha A', 'Cartaxo E', 'Basegio RM', 'Mnayarji A', 'Souza MS', 'Arencibia A', 'Melaragno R', 'Coser VM', 'Lafayete TC', 'Koifman S']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rua Andre Cavalcanti 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231050, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.8.1 (Aryldialkylphosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.8.1 (PON1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Alleles', 'Aryldialkylphosphatase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0060-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Nov;23(11):1811-9. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0060-5.

However, the key pro-survival proteins that must be degraded for triggering neuronal death are mostly unknown. Here, we show that Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is degraded by the proteasome during neuronal apoptosis. Using primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons deprived of serum and KCl, we found that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 depended on its prior phosphorylation by GSK3, providing the first insight into post-translational regulation of Mcl-1 in neurons. In a previous study, we have reported that the E3 ubiquitin-ligase Trim17 is both necessary and sufficient for neuronal apoptosis. Here, we identified Trim17 as a novel E3 ubiquitin-ligase for Mcl-1. Indeed, Trim17 co-immunoprecipitated with Mcl-1. Trim17 ubiquitinated Mcl-1 in vitro. Overexpression of Trim17 decreased the protein level of Mcl-1 in a phosphorylation- and proteasome-dependent manner. Finally, knock down of Trim17 expression reduced both ubiquitination and degradation of Mcl-1 in neurons. Moreover, impairment of Mcl-1 phosphorylation, by kinase inhibition or point mutations, not only decreased ubiquitination and degradation of Mcl-1, but also blocked the physical interaction between Trim17 and Mcl-1. As this stabilization of Mcl-1 increased its neuroprotective effect, our data strongly suggest that Trim17-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Mcl-1 is necessary for initiating neuronal death.","['Magiera, M M', 'Mora, S', 'Mojsa, B', 'Robbins, I', 'Lassot, I', 'Desagher, S']","['Magiera MM', 'Mora S', 'Mojsa B', 'Robbins I', 'Lassot I', 'Desagher S']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier UMR 5535 CNRS, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim17 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitination']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/06/25 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2012124 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2012.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Feb;20(2):281-92. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2012.124.

We have tested the hypothesis that inulin-type fructans (ITF), by promoting microbial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), influence cancer cell proliferation outside the gut. METHODS: Mice transplanted with Bcr-Abl-transfected BaF3 cells, received ITF in their drinking water. Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and qPCR. Serum Short-chain fatty acids were quantified by UHPLC-MS. Cell proliferation was evaluated in vivo, by molecular biology and histology, and in vitro. RESULTS: Inulin-type fructans treatment reduces hepatic BaF3 cell infiltration, lessens inflammation and increases portal propionate concentration. In vitro, propionate reduces BaF3 cell growth through a cAMP level-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the activation of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2), a Gi/Gq-protein-coupled receptor also known as GPR43 and that binds propionate, lessens the proliferation of BaF3 and other human cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that the fermentation of nutrients such as ITF into propionate can counteract malignant cell proliferation in the liver tissue. Our results support the interest of FFA2 activation as a new strategy for cancer therapeutics. This study highlights the importance of research focusing on gut microbes-host interactions for managing systemic and severe diseases such as leukaemia.","['Bindels, L B', 'Porporato, P', 'Dewulf, E M', 'Verrax, J', 'Neyrinck, A M', 'Martin, J C', 'Scott, K P', 'Buc Calderon, P', 'Feron, O', 'Muccioli, G G', 'Sonveaux, P', 'Cani, P D', 'Delzenne, N M']","['Bindels LB', 'Porporato P', 'Dewulf EM', 'Verrax J', 'Neyrinck AM', 'Martin JC', 'Scott KP', 'Buc Calderon P', 'Feron O', 'Muccioli GG', 'Sonveaux P', 'Cani PD', 'Delzenne NM']","['Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Volatile)', '0 (Ffar2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fructans)', '0 (Prebiotics)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', 'JHU490RVYR (propionic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diet', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fructans/*administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Intestines/*microbiology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Metagenome/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Prebiotics', 'Propionates/*metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*metabolism']",2012/09/15 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012409 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.409 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Oct 9;107(8):1337-44. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.409.

The cellular and viral mechanisms regulating HIV-1 latency are not completely understood, and a promising technique for probing the regulation of HIV-1 latency is single-cell time-lapse microscopy. Unfortunately, CD4(+) T lymphocytes rapidly migrate on substrates and spontaneously detach, making them exceedingly difficult to track, hampering single-cell level studies. To overcome these problems, we built microdevices with a three-level architecture. The devices contain arrays of finger-like microchannels to ""corral"" T-lymphocyte migration, round wells that are accessible to pipetting, and microwells connecting the microchannels with the round wells. T lymphocytes that are loaded into a well first settle into the microwells and then to microchannels by gravity. Within the microchannels, T lymphocytes are in favorable culture conditions because they are in physical contact with each other, under no mechanical stress, and fed from a large reservoir of fresh medium. Most importantly, T lymphocytes in the microchannels are not exposed to any flow and their random migration is restricted to a nearly one-dimensional region, greatly facilitating long-term tracking of multiple cells in time-lapse microscopy. The devices have up to nine separate round wells, making it possible to test up to nine different cell lines or medium conditions in a single experiment. Activated primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, resting primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells loaded into the devices maintained viability over multiple days. The devices were used to track the fluorescence level of individual primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) for up to 60 hours (h) and to quantify single-cell gene-expression kinetics of four different HIV-1 variants. The kinetics of GFP expression from the lentiviruses in the primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes agree with previous measurements of these lentiviral vectors in the immortalized Jurkat T lymphocyte cell line. The proposed devices offer a simple, robust approach to long-term single-cell studies of environmentally sensitive primary lymphocytes.","['Razooky, Brandon S', 'Gutierrez, Edgar', 'Terry, Valeri H', 'Spina, Celsa A', 'Groisman, Alex', 'Weinberger, Leor S']","['Razooky BS', 'Gutierrez E', 'Terry VH', 'Spina CA', 'Groisman A', 'Weinberger LS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, CA 92023, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)'],IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'HIV-1/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Single-Cell Analysis/instrumentation', 'Time-Lapse Imaging/*instrumentation']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2lc40170c [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2012 Nov 7;12(21):4305-12. doi: 10.1039/c2lc40170c.,PMC3589574,"['GM084332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD006677/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08326/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI090935/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K25 GM083395/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI096113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL078784/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI096113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM083395/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL078784/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008326/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2OD00667/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI090935/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NIHMS416703'],,,,,,,,,,

The illness-death model is a special multistate model with important applications in the biomedical literature. It provides a suitable representation of the individual's history when a unique intermediate event can be experienced before the main event of interest. Nonparametric estimation of transition probabilities in this and other multistate models is usually performed through the Aalen-Johansen estimator under a Markov assumption. The Markov assumption claims that given the present state, the future evolution of the illness is independent of the states previously visited and the transition times among them. However, this assumption fails in some applications, leading to inconsistent estimates. In this paper, we provide a new approach for testing Markovianity in the illness-death model. The new method is based on measuring the future-past association along time. This results in a detailed inspection of the process, which often reveals a non-Markovian behavior with different trends in the association measure. A test of significance for zero future-past association at each time point is introduced, and a significance trace is proposed accordingly. Besides, we propose a global test for Markovianity based on a supremum-type test statistic. The finite sample performance of the test is investigated through simulations. We illustrate the new method through the analysis of two biomedical data analysis.","['Rodriguez-Girondo, Mar', 'de Una-Alvarez, Jacobo']","['Rodriguez-Girondo M', 'de Una-Alvarez J']","['SiDOR Research Group, University of Vigo, Facultade de CC Economicas e Empresariais, Campus Lagoas-Marcosende, 36310 Vigo, Spain. margirondo@uvigo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Biometry/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Computer Simulation', '*Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', '*Markov Chains', 'Models, Biological', '*Monte Carlo Method', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', '*Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.5619 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 Dec 30;31(30):4416-27. doi: 10.1002/sim.5619.

All specimens of stage 3 in bright CD45 expression were positive for CD5 and included CD5(+)CD23(-)CD11c(-), 11.1%, CD5(+)CD23(+)CD11c(-), 85.2%, and CD5(+)CD23(+)CD11c(+), 3.7%. These findings suggest that hematogones with unreported immunophenotypes may exist and the appearance of hematogones in hematologic malignancies may be relatively frequent.","['Kobayashi, Shoichi', 'Kumagai, Risa', 'Omiya, Akiko', 'Tanno, Hideki', 'Ishii, Yoshimi', 'Yamamoto, Wataru', 'Takasaki, Hirotaka', 'Sakai, Rika', 'Numata, Ayumi', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Motomura, Shigeki', 'Maruta, Atsuo']","['Kobayashi S', 'Kumagai R', 'Omiya A', 'Tanno H', 'Ishii Y', 'Yamamoto W', 'Takasaki H', 'Sakai R', 'Numata A', 'Matsumoto K', 'Tanaka M', 'Kanamori H', 'Motomura S', 'Maruta A']","['Division of Clinical Laboratory, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['DN/JST.JSTAGE/rinketsu/53.753 [pii]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2012 Aug;53(8):753-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-five patients achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Fifty-seven patients received consolidation chemotherapy based on the policy of not performing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at the time of first CR. Twenty-seven of the 57 patients relapsed (relapse rate, 47%). The median time from the achievement of the first CR to relapse was 307 days (96 approximately 1,256 days). A white blood cell count of more than 25,400/mul at diagnosis was associated with a higher relapse rate than a white blood cell count of less than or equal to 25,400/mul (75% vs. 43%, P=0.04). Nineteen of the 25 relapsed patients who received re-induction therapy experienced a second CR (second CR rate, 76%). Twenty-six patients (5 with first CR, 12 with second CR, and 9 without remission) received allo-HSCT. The five-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 61% and 45%, respectively.

In this study we report for the first time that ibrutinib is cytotoxic to malignant plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and furthermore that treatment with ibrutinib significantly augments the cytotoxic activity of bortezomib and lenalidomide chemotherapies. We describe that the cytotoxicity of ibrutinib in MM is mediated via an inhibitory effect on the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. Specifically, ibrutinib blocks the phosphorylation of serine-536 of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, preventing its nuclear translocation, resulting in down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, FLIP(L) and survivin and culminating in caspase-mediated apoptosis within the malignant plasma cells. Taken together these data provide a platform for clinical trials of ibrutinib in myeloma and a rationale for its use in combination therapy, particularly with bortezomib.","['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Barrera, Lawrence N', 'Murray, Megan Y', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'Bowles KM', 'Barrera LN', 'Murray MY', 'Zaitseva L', 'MacEwan DJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (LFM A13)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Lenalidomide', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00250-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Jan;25(1):106-12. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.09.008.

Consequently, thyroid function is usually monitored once or twice yearly. Occasionally, the dose of levothyroxine can be changed by pharmacological reactions. We report the case of a 59-year-old woman who was under levothyroxine therapy for hypothyroidism secondary to subtotal thyroidectomy, with clinical and biochemical euthyroidism, who required an increased dose of levothyroxine after starting imatinib therapy. The patient was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia and imatinib therapy was started. Subsequently, we observed clinical and biochemical hypothyroidism, requiring an increase in levothyroxine dose. Some cases of hypothyroidism after initiation of imatinib therapy in patients with levothyroxine replacement therapy have recently been published. Our case provides further evidence of a reaction between the two drugs. Therefore, we discuss the most likely physiopathological mechanisms contributing to imatinib-induced hypothyroidism in patients under levothyroxine replacement therapy.","['de Diego Garcia, Patricia', 'Trincado Aznar, Pablo', 'Playan Uson, Jesus', 'Albero Gamboa, Ramon']","['de Diego Garcia P', 'Trincado Aznar P', 'Playan Uson J', 'Albero Gamboa R']",['Servicio de Endocrinologia y Nutricion.

There is little documentation of ethnic differences in this increased risk, and most of the Asian studies are hospital-based studies with small case numbers. METHODS: Using population-based data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry for the period 1979-2008, we quantified standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) among 52,972 women with initial diagnoses of cervical cancer. RESULTS: Among the 52,972 women, 3061 (5.78%) developed second primary cancers during 433,571 person-years of follow-up. Overall, the SIR for developing a subsequent second cancer was significantly greater than that of the general population (1.36 [95% CI, 1.32-1.41]). There was a greater risk for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, rectum, lung, bone, non-melanoma skin, uterine corpus, vagina/vulva, bladder, kidney, and leukemia. When further examining age at diagnosis of cervical cancer (<50 and >/=50) for these 12 sites, we found that the risk of second cancers (SIR, <50 and >/=50: 3.08 vs. 1.63) was higher not only in younger patients, except for non-melanoma skin cancer and endometrial cancer, but also within the first 5 years after diagnosis of cervical cancer. The median overall survival for women with cervical cancer was 18.58 years. The second cancers had a negative impact on overall survival after adjusting for age (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SIR for second cancers was significantly greater than the general population in cervical cancer patients. A young age at the diagnosis of cervical cancer predicted an increased risk. The second cancers worsened overall survival.","['Chen, Chao-Yu', 'Lai, Chyong-Huey', 'Lee, Kuan-Der', 'Huang, Shih-Hao', 'Dai, Yen-Mei', 'Chen, Min-Chi']","['Chen CY', 'Lai CH', 'Lee KD', 'Huang SH', 'Dai YM', 'Chen MC']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120910,United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0090-8258(12)00737-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 2012 Dec;127(3):625-30. doi: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.09.004.

METHODS: The intracellular domain of Notch was conditionally expressed in hepatoblasts and their progeny (hepatocytes and cholangiocytes) in mice. This was achieved through Cre expression under the control of an albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) enhancer and promoter (AFP-Notch intracellular domain [NICD]). We used comparative functional genomics to integrate transcriptome data from AFP-NICD mice and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples (n = 683). A Notch gene signature was generated using the nearest template prediction method. RESULTS: AFP-NICD mice developed HCC with 100% penetrance when they were 12 months old. Activation of Notch signaling correlated with activation of 3 promoters of insulin-like growth factor 2; these processes appeared to contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Comparative functional genomic analysis identified a signature of Notch activation in 30% of HCC samples from patients. These samples had altered expression in Notch pathway genes and activation of insulin-like growth factor signaling, despite a low frequency of mutations in regions of NOTCH1 associated with cancer. Blocking Notch signaling in liver cancer cells with the Notch activation signature using gamma-secretase inhibitors or by expressing a dominant negative form of mastermind-like 1 reduced their proliferation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Notch signaling is activated in human HCC samples and promotes formation of liver tumors in mice. The Notch signature is a biomarker of response to Notch inhibition in vitro.","['Villanueva, Augusto', 'Alsinet, Clara', 'Yanger, Kilangsungla', 'Hoshida, Yujin', 'Zong, Yiwei', 'Toffanin, Sara', 'Rodriguez-Carunchio, Leonardo', 'Sole, Manel', 'Thung, Swan', 'Stanger, Ben Z', 'Llovet, Josep M']","['Villanueva A', 'Alsinet C', 'Yanger K', 'Hoshida Y', 'Zong Y', 'Toffanin S', 'Rodriguez-Carunchio L', 'Sole M', 'Thung S', 'Stanger BZ', 'Llovet JM']","[""HCC Translational Research Laboratory, Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0016-5085(12)01311-X [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2012.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2012 Dec;143(6):1660-1669.e7. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2012.09.002.

Nevertheless, there has been no report on the association of the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in OVH and OL biopsy tissues prior to PDT with PDT treatment outcomes. METHODS: This study used immunohistochemistry to evaluate whether the expression of Bak, Mcl-1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, p53, p21, or PCNA protein in biopsy specimens of OVH and OL lesions could be used to predict the clinical outcomes of 18 OVH and 40 OL lesions treated with topical ALA-PDT. The marker labeling score (LS) was defined as labeling index (positive cells/total cells) multiplied by staining intensity. The lesions after ALA-PDT treatment were divided into complete response (CR) group and partial or no response (PR/NR) group. RESULTS: The mean Bak LS and the mean Bak/Mcl-1 LS ratio were significantly higher in the CR group than in the PR/NR group.

Through optimization of the CAR construct from first generation to third generation, the properties of these CAR-modified T lymphocytes, including, cytokines release, proliferative capacity, in vivo survival time, have been remarkably improved. These improvements accelerate the clinical applications of the CAR-modified T lymphocytes. Due to CD19, and CD20 specificity, CAR-modified T lymphocytes have been clinically used to treat leukemia. Notably, T lymphocytes genetically engineered by Carl June group with CAR targeting to CD19 have expanded more than 1,000 folds by clearing all CD19 positive leukemia cells, even the normal B cells, which infiltrated in bone marrow, and survived for more than 6 months. This encouraging report demonstrates the overwhelming tumor-lytic ability of the CAR-modified T lymphocytes; it also raises the concern about the chronic toxicity. Here, we emphasize the safety concern when using the CAR-modified T lymphocytes.

Therefore, we investigated the possibility of combining adoptive immunotherapy with CIK cells and human interferon-alpha (hIFN-alpha) in order to potentiate the cytotoxicity of CIK cells against B-ALL. METHODS: Cord blood- derived CIK (CB-CIK) cells were differentiated, stimulated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or hIFN-alpha, and tested for cytotoxic activity. We tested the anti-leukemic and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) effects of CB-CIK cells in a human xenograft NOD/SCID/gammac(-) (NSG) mouse model. RESULTS: Bulk CB-CIK cells showed very moderate cytotoxic activity while the subpopulation of CD56(+) CB-CIK cells showed significant cytotoxic activity against B-ALL cells. hIFN-alpha significantly augmented the cytotoxicity of CD56(+)CB-CIK cells in vitro and induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) phosphorylation. In addition, CD56(+)CB-CIK cells could delay mouse mortality significantly in vivo, and this effect was enhanced significantly by hIFN-alpha (P = 0.022). Furthermore, unlike CB mononuclear cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), CD56(+)CB-CIK cells, alone or stimulated with hIFN-alpha, caused either no GvHD or mild GvHD, respectively, when injected into sublethally irradiated NSG mice. CONCLUSIONS: CD56(+)CB-CIK cells are effective cytotoxic agents against human B-ALL cell lines in vitro and possess anti-leukemic activity that is potentiated by hIFN-alpha in an NSG mouse model in vivo. These pre-clinical data support the testing of this immunotherapeutic approach in the clinic for the treatment of B-ALL.","['Durrieu, Ludovic', 'Gregoire-Gauthier, Joelle', 'Dieng, Mame Massar', 'Fontaine, Francois', 'le Deist, Francoise', 'Haddad, Elie']","['Durrieu L', 'Gregoire-Gauthier J', 'Dieng MM', 'Fontaine F', 'le Deist F', 'Haddad E']","['CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Center of Cancerology Charles-Bruneau, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120914,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2012.714864 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(12)71243-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2012 Nov;14(10):1245-57. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2012.714864.

Although both viruses immortalize T-cells in vitro, they exhibit distinct pathogenic potential in vivo. To search for possible differences in its expression strategy with respect to HTLV-1, we investigated the pattern of HTLV-2 expression in infected cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from infected patients using splice site-specific quantitative RT-PCR. FINDINGS: A novel alternative splice acceptor site for exon 2 was identified; its usage in env transcripts was found to be subtype-specific. Time-course analysis revealed a two-phase expression kinetics in an infected cell line and in PBMCs of two of the three patients examined; this pattern was reminiscent of HTLV-1. In addition, the minus-strand APH2 transcript was mainly detected in the nucleus, a feature that was similar to its HTLV-1 orthologue HBZ. In contrast to HTLV-1, expression of the mRNA encoding the main regulatory proteins Tax and Rex and that of the mRNAs encoding the p28 and truncated Rex inhibitors is skewed towards p28/truncated Rex inhibitors in HTLV-2. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a general converging pattern of expression of HTLV-2 and HTLV-1 and highlight peculiar differences in the expression of regulatory proteins that might influence the pathobiology of these viruses.","['Bender, Cecilia', 'Rende, Francesca', 'Cotena, Alessia', 'Righi, Paola', 'Ronzi, Paola', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Casoli, Claudio', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto']","['Bender C', 'Rende F', 'Cotena A', 'Righi P', 'Ronzi P', 'Cavallari I', 'Casoli C', 'Ciminale V', 'Bertazzoni U']","['Department of Life and Reproduction Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/15 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-74 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-74 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Sep 13;9:74. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-74.,PMC3468393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A biased immunoglobulin gene repertoire is seen as evidence for selection of CLL progenitor cells by antigen. Additional corroborative evidence is provided by the differential prognosis of cases with distinct mutational status of the clonotypic BCRs. However, perhaps the strongest immunogenetic evidence for the importance of interactions with microenvironment in driving CLL development and evolution is the existence of subsets of patients with quasi-identical, stereotyped BCRs, collectively accounting for a remarkable one-third of the entire cohort. These observations have been instrumental in shaping the notion that CLL ontogeny is functionally driven and dynamic, rather than a simple stochastic process.

Although HTLV-1 has a compact RNA genome, it has evolved elaborate mechanisms to maximize its coding potential. The structural proteins Gag, Pro, and Pol are encoded in the unspliced form of viral mRNA, whereas the Env protein is encoded in singly spliced viral mRNA. Regulatory and accessory proteins, such as Tax, Rex, p30II, p12, and p13, are translated only from fully spliced mRNA. For effective viral replication, translation from all forms of HTLV-1 transcripts has to be achieved in concert, although unspliced mRNA are extremely unstable in mammalian cells. It has been well recognized that HTLV-1 Rex enhances the stability of unspliced and singly spliced HTLV-1 mRNA by promoting nuclear export and thereby removing them from the splicing site. Rex specifically binds to the highly structured Rex responsive element (RxRE) located at the 3' end of all HTLV-1 mRNA. Rex then binds to the cellular nuclear exporter, CRM1, via its nuclear export signal domain and the Rex-viral transcript complex is selectively exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for effective translation of the viral proteins. Yet, the mechanisms by which Rex inhibits the cellular splicing machinery and utilizes the cellular pathways beneficial to viral survival in the host cell have not been fully explored. Furthermore, physiological impacts of Rex against homeostasis of the host cell via interactions with numerous cellular proteins have been largely left uninvestigated. In this review, we focus on the biological importance of HTLV-1 Rex in the HTLV-1 life cycle by following the historical path in the literature concerning this viral post-transcriptional regulator from its discovery to this day. In addition, for future studies, we discuss recently discovered aspects of HTLV-1 Rex as a post-transcriptional regulator and its use in host cellular pathways.","['Nakano, Kazumi', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Nakano K', 'Watanabe T']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120906,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2012/09/14 06:00,2012/09/14 06:01,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00330 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Sep 6;3:330. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00330. eCollection 2012.,PMC3434621,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-23', 'CRM1', 'HIV-1 Rev', 'HTLV-1 Rex', 'HTLV-2', 'importinbeta', 'post-translational regulator', 'retroviruses']",,,,,,,

To date, many epidemiological studies have been conducted to investigate the incidence of ATL among general population or HTLV-1 carriers and to identify a variety of laboratory, molecular, and host-specific markers to be possible predictive factors for developing ATL because HTLV-1 infection alone is not sufficient to develop ATL. This literature review focuses on the epidemiology of ATL and the risk factors for the development of ATL from HTLV-1 carriers, while keeping information on the epidemiology of HTLV-1 to a minimum. The main lines of epidemiological evidence are: (1) ATL occurs mostly in adults, at least 20-30 years after the HTLV-1 infection, (2) age at onset differs across geographic areas: the average age in the Central and South America (around 40 years old) is younger than that in Japan (around 60 years old), (3) ATL occurs in those infected in childhood, but seldom occurs in those infected in adulthood, (4) male carriers have about a three- to fivefold higher risk of developing ATL than female, (5) the estimated lifetime risk of developing ATL in HTLV-1 carriers is 6-7% for men and 2-3% for women in Japan, (6) a low anti-Tax reactivity, a high soluble interleukin-2 receptor level, a high anti-HTLV-1 titer, and high levels of circulating abnormal lymphocytes and white blood cell count are accepted risk factors for the development of ATL, and (7) a higher proviral load (more than 4 copies/100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is an independent risk factor for progression of ATL. Nevertheless, the current epidemiological evidence is insufficient to fully understand the oncogenesis of ATL. Further well-designed epidemiological studies are needed.","['Iwanaga, Masako', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari']","['Iwanaga M', 'Watanabe T', 'Yamaguchi K']","['Graduate School of Public Health, Teikyo University Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120910,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2012/09/14 06:00,2012/09/14 06:01,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00322 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Sep 10;3:322. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00322. eCollection 2012.,PMC3437524,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'epidemiology', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type I']",,,,,,,

An interaction involving a region within the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of E2A-PBX1, termed the PCET motif, which has previously been implicated in E-protein silencing, and the KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300, critical for leukemogenesis. However, the structural details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we report the structure of a 1:1 complex between PCET motif peptide and the KIX domain. Residues throughout the helical PCET motif that contact the KIX domain are important for both binding KIX and bone marrow immortalization by E2A-PBX1. These results provide molecular insights into E-protein-driven differentiation of B-cells and the mechanism of E-protein silencing, and reveal the PCET/KIX interaction as a therapeutic target for E2A-PBX1-induced leukemia.","['Denis, Christopher M', 'Chitayat, Seth', 'Plevin, Michael J', 'Wang, Feng', 'Thompson, Patrick', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Spencer, Holly L', 'Ikura, Mitsuhiko', 'LeBrun, David P', 'Smith, Steven P']","['Denis CM', 'Chitayat S', 'Plevin MJ', 'Wang F', 'Thompson P', 'Liu S', 'Spencer HL', 'Ikura M', 'LeBrun DP', 'Smith SP']","[""Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '142661-93-6 (TCF12 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*chemistry/metabolism']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53875-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-411397 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 8;120(19):3968-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-411397.

Therefore, the exploration of a safe and reliable strategy exclusive of chemotherapy is critical in improving the prognosis of elderly patients with haematological malignancies. We evaluated the safety and the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells combined with recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) in the treatment of haematological malignancies in elderly patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 20 elderly patients with haematological malignancies, then augmented by priming with interferon gamma, rhIL-2 and CD3 monoclonal antibody. The autologous CIK cells (2-3 x 10(9)) were transfused back to patients, followed by a subcutaneous injection of IL-2 (1 mU/day) for 10 consecutive days. The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks. The host cellular immune function, tumour-related biological parameters, imaging characteristics, disease condition, quality of life and survival time were assessed. Fourteen patients received 8 cycles of transfusion and 6 received 4 cycles. No adverse effects were observed. The percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+) CD8(+) and CD3(+) CD56(+) cells were significantly increased (p < 0.05), and the levels of serum beta2 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were markedly decreased (p < 0.05) after autologous CIK cell transfusion. Cancer-related symptoms were profoundly alleviated, as demonstrated by the improved quality of life (p < 0.01). Complete remission was observed in 11 patients, persistent partial remission in 7 patients and stable disease in 2 patients. At the end of follow-up, the mean survival time was 20 months.

However, APL is extremely rare in children. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 1-year-old boy presented with a mass on the mentum of the mandible. The marked periosteal reaction was seen on CT and MRI, leading to strong suspicion of a malignant bone-derived tumor such as a sarcoma. Chromosome banding by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed PML-RARalpha, confirming the diagnosis of APL. Treatment with tretinoin was immediately initiated. No signs of recurrence have been noted 1 year after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We report herein a rare case involving an infant with APL who presented with an extramedullary tumor of the mandible, whom we treated with good results.","['Yamashita, Yoshio', 'Isomura, Naoko', 'Hamasaki, Yuhei', 'Goto, Masaaki']","['Yamashita Y', 'Isomura N', 'Hamasaki Y', 'Goto M']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120913,United States,Head Neck,Head & neck,8902541,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Mandibular Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Photomicrography', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2012/09/14 06:00,2014/06/07 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hed.23163 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck. 2013 Oct;35(10):E310-3. doi: 10.1002/hed.23163.

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) treatment is highly effective for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marginal-zone lymphoma. We first report the safety and efficacy of FCR treatment in severe and refractory MC vasculitis associated with lymphoma. METHODS: We report the safety and efficacy of fludarabine (40 mg/m(2) orally on days 2-4), cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2) orally on days 2-4), and rituximab (375 mg/m(2) on day 1), every 4 weeks, for 3 to 6 cycles in 7 consecutive patients with severe and refractory MC. RESULTS: Clinical features of MC included purpura (n = 7), polyneuropathy (n = 6), and kidney (n = 4) and cardiac involvement (n = 2). Previous treatment included rituximab (n = 5), corticosteroids (n = 5), antiviral therapy (n = 5), cyclophosphamide (n = 3), and plasmapheresis (n = 2). All patients achieved clinical response, with 3 patients (42.9%) achieving a complete remission and 4 patients (57.1%) a partial remission. Cryoglobulin decreased from 0.94 to 0.41 gm/liter (P = 0.015). After a followup of 27 months, 2 patients experienced a relapse of MC. Five patients (71.4%) experienced side effects, including cytopenia (n = 5), pneumopathy (n = 2), and serum sickness (n = 1).

The aim of this study was to determine the anti-leukemia effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on a mouse leukemia cell line, WEHI-3. GA, an active compound in Glycyrrhiza glabra, has been proven to induce cytotoxic effects in many cancer cell lines. In the current study, we investigated the effects of GA in mouse leukemia cells in vitro. The results indicated that GA induced morphological changes, G0/G1 phase arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage in WEHI-3 cells as determined by phase contrast microscopy, DAPI-staining, flow cytometry and comet assay. The results from the flow cytometric assay showed that GA increased ROS levels, reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and stimulated caspase-3 activity in WEHI-3 cells. GA regulated the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis-associated protein expression which was determined by western blotting. In addition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses were observed in GA-treated WEHI-3 cells. GA promoted the trafficking of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), cytochrome c and endonuclease G (Endo G) in WEHI-3 cells. Based on this evidence, GA-triggered apoptosis occurs through the death receptor, mitochondria-mediated and ER stress multiple signaling pathways.","['Chueh, Fu-Shin', 'Hsiao, Yung-Ting', 'Chang, Shu-Jen', 'Wu, Ping-Ping', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Lin, Jen-Jyh', 'Chung, Jing-Gung', 'Lai, Tung-Yuan']","['Chueh FS', 'Hsiao YT', 'Chang SJ', 'Wu PP', 'Yang JS', 'Lin JJ', 'Chung JG', 'Lai TY']","['Department of Health and Nutrition Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120912,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '6FO62043WK (Glycyrrhizic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Glycyrrhizic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.2029 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Dec;28(6):2069-76. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2029.

Abnobaviscum F(R) is a European mistletoe extract from the host tree Fraxinus. We investigated the effect of Abnobaviscum F on the growth and survival of different leukemia cell lines. Abnobaviscum F treatment strongly reduced survival and induced apoptosis of K562 (human myeloid leukemia), RPMI-8226 (human plasmacytoma) and L1210 (murine lymphocytic leukemia) cells in culture. Using K562 cells to further investigate the mechanism of action of Abnobaviscum F, we showed that Abnobaviscum F-induced cell death was associated with the activation of caspase-9, JNK-1/2 and p38 MAPK, as well as with the downregulation of Mcl-1, and inhibition of ERK-1/2 and PKB phosphorylation. Moreover, Abnobaviscum F treatment led to both a reduction of cellular glutathione (GSH) and the induction of ER stress (GRP78 and CHOP induction and eIF-2alpha phosphorylation). By contrast, Abnobaviscum F did not impact the expression of the DR4 and DR5 death receptors. The Abnobaviscum F-induced apoptosis of K562 cells was blocked by pretreatment with either GSH, z-VAD-fmk or SP600125. Our results, therefore, show that Abnobaviscum F induces apoptosis of K562 cells through the activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway, the phosphorylation of JNK-1, the reduction of cellular GSH, and the induction of ER stress.","['Park, Yu-Kyoung', 'Do, Young Rok', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl']","['Park YK', 'Do YR', 'Jang BC']","['Department of Medical Genetic Engineering, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120912,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Glutathione/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plasmacytoma/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/biosynthesis', 'Viscum album/*chemistry', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.2026 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Dec;28(6):2227-32. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2026.

By infecting the bone marrow (BM) stroma of the transplantation recipient, CMV can directly interfere with BM repopulation by the transplanted donor-derived hematopoietic cells and thus delay immune reconstitution of the recipient. Cytopathogenic virus spread in tissues can result in CMV disease with multiple organ manifestations of which interstitial pneumonia is the most feared. There exists a 'window of risk' between hematoablative treatment and reconstitution of antiviral immunity after HCT, whereby timely reconstitution of antiviral CD8 T cells is a recognized positive prognostic parameter for the control of reactivated CMV infection and prevention of CMV disease. Supplementation of endogenous reconstitution by adoptive cell transfer of 'ready-to-go' effector and/or memory virus epitope-specific CD8 T cells is a therapeutic option to bridge the 'window of risk.' Preclinical research in murine models of CMV disease has been pivotal by providing 'proof of concept' for a benefit from CD8 T-cell therapy of HCT-associated CMV disease (reviewed in Holtappels et al. Med Microbiol Immunol 197:125-134, 2008). Here, we give an update of our previous review with focus on parameters that determine the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of CMV infection by antiviral CD8 T cells in the murine model.","['Ebert, Stefan', 'Podlech, Jurgen', 'Gillert-Marien, Dorothea', 'Gergely, Kerstin M', 'Buttner, Julia K', 'Fink, Annette', 'Freitag, Kirsten', 'Thomas, Doris', 'Reddehase, Matthias J', 'Holtappels, Rafaela']","['Ebert S', 'Podlech J', 'Gillert-Marien D', 'Gergely KM', 'Buttner JK', 'Fink A', 'Freitag K', 'Thomas D', 'Reddehase MJ', 'Holtappels R']","['Institute for Virology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, Hochhaus am Augustusplatz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120913,Germany,Med Microbiol Immunol,Medical microbiology and immunology,0314524,,IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Mice', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/03/02 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00430-012-0258-x [doi]'],ppublish,Med Microbiol Immunol. 2012 Nov;201(4):527-39. doi: 10.1007/s00430-012-0258-x.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a lymphoid malignancy similar to small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in its leukaemic phase.Indolent lymphoid malignancies including CLL are characterised by slow growth, a high initial response rate and a relapsing and progressive disease course. Advanced-stage indolent B cell lymphoid malignancies are often incurable. If symptoms or progressive disease occur, chemotherapy plus rituximab is indicated. No chemotherapy regimen has been shown to improve overall survival compared to a different regimen.Bendamustine is efficacious in the treatment of patients with indolent B cell lymphoid malignancies. A number of randomised controlled trials have examined the effect of bendamustine compared to other chemotherapy regimens in these patients. Improved disease control with no survival benefit is shown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of bendamustine therapy for patients with indolent B cell lymphoid malignancies including CLL. SEARCH METHODS: We electronically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2012), EMBASE (1974 to November 2011), LILACS (1982 to May 2012), databases of ongoing trials (accessed 30 April 2012) and relevant conference proceedings. We searched references of identified trials and contacted the first author of each included trial. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials that compared a bendamustine-containing regimen to other chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted data from included trials. We estimated and pooled hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials randomising 1343 adult patients in the systematic review. Allocation and blinding were unclear in three trials and adequate in two. Incomplete outcome data and selective reporting were adequate in all trials. Trials varied in the type of lymphoid malignancy, bendamustine regimen and the comparator regimen. In the three trials that included patients with follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and other indolent lymphomas the comparator treatment was cyclophosphamide, a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone, and fludarabine. Two trials included only patients with CLL and compared bendamustine to chlorambucil, and to fludarabine. We did not conduct a meta-analysis due to the clinical heterogeneity among trials. Bendamustine had no statistically significant effect on the overall survival of patients with indolent B cell lymphoid malignancies in any of the included trials (trials of moderate quality). Progression-free survival was statistically significantly improved with bendamustine treatment compared to other chemotherapy in three of the four trials that reported on it. One trial demonstrated a non statistically significant improvement of PFS. The risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar when bendamustine was compared to CHOP and fludarabine, and higher when compared to chlorambucil. Compared to chlorambucil quality of life was unaffected by bendamustine treatment (one trial, no meta-analysis). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: As none of the currently available chemotherapeutic protocols for induction therapy in indolent B cell lymphoid malignancies confer a survival benefit and due to the improved progression-free survival in each of the included trials, and a similar rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, bendamustine may be considered for the treatment of patients with indolent B cell lymphoid malignancies. However, the unclear effect on survival and the higher rate of adverse events compared to chlorambucil in patients with CLL/SLL does not support the use of bendamustine for these patients.The effect of bendamustine combined with rituximab should be evaluated in randomised clinical trials with more homogenous populations and outcomes for specific subgroups of patients by type of lymphoma should be reported. Any future trial should evaluate the effect of bendamustine on quality of life.","['Vidal, Liat', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Gurion, Ronit', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Dreyling, Martin', 'Shpilberg, Ofer']","['Vidal L', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Gurion R', 'Raanani P', 'Dreyling M', 'Shpilberg O']","['Department of Medicine E, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel. vidallit@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20120912,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/mortality', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy/mortality']",2012/09/14 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009045.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Sep 12;(9):CD009045. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009045.pub2.,PMC7387870,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the histone methyltransferase MMSET (WHSC1/NSD2), due to t(4;14) chromosomal translocation, promotes the proliferation of MM cells along with global changes in chromatin; nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which MMSET stimulates neoplasia remain incompletely understood. We found that MMSET enhances the proliferation of MM cells by stimulating the expression of c-MYC at the post-transcriptional level. A microRNA (miRNA) profiling experiment in t(4;14) MM cells identified miR-126* as an MMSET-regulated miRNA predicted to target c-MYC mRNA. We show that miR-126* specifically targets the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of c-MYC, inhibiting its translation and leading to decreased c-MYC protein levels. Moreover, the expression of this miRNA was sufficient to decrease the proliferation rate of t(4;14) MM cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that MMSET binds to the miR-126* promoter along with the KAP1 corepressor and histone deacetylases, and is associated with heterochromatic modifications, characterized by increased trimethylation of H3K9 and decreased H3 acetylation, leading to miR-126* repression. Collectively, this study shows a novel mechanism that leads to increased c-MYC levels and enhanced proliferation of t(4;14) MM, and potentially other cancers with high MMSET expression.","['Min, D-J', 'Ezponda, T', 'Kim, M K', 'Will, C M', 'Martinez-Garcia, E', 'Popovic, R', 'Basrur, V', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, K S', 'Licht, J D']","['Min DJ', 'Ezponda T', 'Kim MK', 'Will CM', 'Martinez-Garcia E', 'Popovic R', 'Basrur V', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS', 'Licht JD']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012269 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.269 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):686-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.269.

However, disparities in hematologic malignancies have been relatively unexplored on population-based levels. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and acute leukemia mortality. METHODS: All patients with acute leukemia [acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)] were identified in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database, 1999-2008. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to reflect survival probabilities by race/ethnicity. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard of mortality by race with adjustment for individual (age, gender, year of diagnosis) and select genetic factors. RESULTS: A total of 39,002 patients with acute leukemia were included in the study. Overall, there was a mortality disparity in acute leukemia for blacks (HR 1.17, p < 0.0001) and Hispanics (HR 1.13, p < 0.0001) compared with non-Hispanic whites. In stratified analysis, disparities in ALL were greater than AML; blacks (HR[ALL]1.45, p < 0.0001; HR[AML]1.12, p < 0.0011); Hispanics (HR[ALL]1.46, p < 0.0001; HR[AML]1.06, p < 0.0001). Adjustment for individual patient and select genetic factors did not explain disparities. CONCLUSIONS: Blacks and Hispanics suffer decreased survival in acute leukemia as compared to others. Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of poor cancer outcomes in these populations.","['Patel, M I', 'Ma, Y', 'Mitchell, B S', 'Rhoads, K F']","['Patel MI', 'Ma Y', 'Mitchell BS', 'Rhoads KF']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 875 Blake Wilbur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. tarheelmanali@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120913,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Healthcare Disparities/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*ethnology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*ethnology/*mortality/pathology', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0062-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Nov;23(11):1831-7. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0062-3.

The miR-29 family consists of four members with shared regulatory capacity, namely miR-29a, miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2 and miR-29c. Being expressed in both T and B cells, as well as the main accessory cell types of thymic epithelium and dendritic cells, the miR-29 family has been identified as a putative regulator of immunity due to the predicted suppression of key immunological pathways. The generation of a series of in vivo molecular tools targeting the miR-29 family has identified the critical role of these miR in setting the molecular threshold for three central events in adaptive immunity: (1) control over thymic production of T cells by modulating the threshold for infection-associated thymic involution, (2) creating a neutral threshold for T cell polarization following activation, and (3) setting the threshold for B cell oncogenic transformation.

All current therapy regimens used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia include prophylaxis of the central nervous system. Initially it was thought that the best way of central nervous system prophylaxis is radiotherapy. But despite its effectiveness this method, may cause late sequelae and complications. In the programme currently used in Poland to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prophylactic radiotherapy has been reduced by 50% (12 Gy) and is used only in patients stratified into the high risk group and in patients diagnosed as T-cell ALL (T-ALL). Complementary to radiotherapy, intrathecal methotrexate is given alone or in combination with cytarabine and hydrocortisone is given, as well as systemic chemotherapy with intravenous methotrexate is administered in high or medium doses (depending on risk groups and leukemia immunophenotype). Recent studies have shown that high dose irradiation of the central nervous system impairs cognitive development causing memory loss, visuomotor coordination impairment, attention disorders and reduction in the intelligence quotient. It has been proved that the degree of cognitive impairment depends on the radiation dose directed to the medial temporal lobe structures, particularly in the hippocampus and the surrounding cortex. Also, methotrexate used intravenously in high doses, interferes with the metabolism of folic acid which is necessary for normal development and the optimal functioning of neurons in the central nervous system. It has been proved that patients who have been treated with high doses of methotrexate are characterized by reduced memory skills and a lower intelligence quotient. The literature data concerning long term neuroanatomical abnormalities and neuropsychological deficits are ambiguous, and there is still no data concerning current methods of central nervous system prophylaxis with low doses of irradiation in combination with high doses of intravenous methotrexate.","['Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Wachowiak, Jacek']","['Zajac-Spychala O', 'Wachowiak J']","['Klinika Onkologii, Hematologii i Transplantologii Pediatrycznej UM w Poznaniu, ul.

Given these data, we sought to study the role of p73 methylation in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In this study, the methylation status of the p73 gene promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) samples from 135 adult patients with de novo MDS. The results of MS-PCR were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. We found that p73 methylation was present in 37% (n = 50) of these cases and methylaiton was correlated significantly with World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes. Patients with advanced stages of WHO subtypes (30 vs. 59%, P = 0.002) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p73 methylation. Moreover, a decrease in transcription of p73 was accompanied by methylation (P = 0.032) and the decitabine treatment restored the expression of p73. The median survival of patients with p73 methylation was shorter than that for patients without p73 methylation (15 vs. >33 months, P = 0.002). A multivariate analysis also indicated that the p73 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS). However, we failed to find any significant association between p73 methylation and clinical responses to decitabine, a hypomethylating agent that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with MDS. In conclusion, p73 methylation is common in patients with MDS and indicate poor prognosis. p73 may be a therapeutic target in MDS.","['Zhao, Youshan', 'Gu, Shucheng', 'Guo, Juan', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Li, Xiao', 'Chang, Chunkang']","['Zhao Y', 'Gu S', 'Guo J', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang X', 'Li X', 'Chang C']","['Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000018 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Sep;17(5):275-82. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZAP-70 is expressed in normal T-cells and NK-cells. Increased expression of ZAP-70 has been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL patients with increased ZAP-70 expression have significantly worse prognosis in terms of both progression-free survival and overall survival. There are several methods to quantify ZAP-70: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Use of flow cytometry for ZAP-70 detection seems to be advantageous as this technique enables us to assess the presence of ZAP-70 separately on CLL clone, T-cells, and NK-cells. On the other hand, detection of ZAP-70 by flow cytometry is substantially influenced by many variables. The principal drawback of flow cytometry is the absence of consensus regarding selection of optimal anti-ZAP-70 antibody, fluorochrome conjugate, the most reliable staining technique, and optimal positivity threshold. This article summarizes pitfalls of flow cytometric analysis of ZAP-70 in CLL.","['Vroblova, V', 'Smolej, L', 'Krejsek, J']","['Vroblova V', 'Smolej L', 'Krejsek J']","['Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Charles University, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. vroblvla@fnhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis/immunology']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000015 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Sep;17(5):268-74. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survival benefit demonstrated in clinical trials does not simply translate to a decrease in mortality. To evaluate the impact of imatinib on the public health, we estimated the age-standardized mortality rate of CML patients in Japan and the U.S. using vital statistics data for Japan and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute for the U.S. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The period covered in this analysis is 1993-2008, during which 64,203 patients in Japan and 26,888 patients in nine registries in the U.S. died as a result of CML. We used joinpoint regression analysis to evaluate the significance of trends in mortality. RESULTS: Estimated age-standardized mortality rates decreased significantly in both countries after the availability of imatinib. The annual percent changes (95% confidence interval) in the U.S. were -12.3% (-14.8% to -9.7%) for men and -11.6% (-13.1% to -10.1%) for women. In Japan, these were -20.8% (-36.2% to -1.6%) for men and -15.6% (-18.8% to -12.2%) for women. The period of change in the mortality trend seems to correlate with the period in which imatinib appeared in the two countries. The CML mortality rate in 2008 was nearly 30% that of the 1993 level. CONCLUSION: This is one example of the advent of a single new drug changing the picture of a single disease, CML. These results may encourage further development of drugs based on the concept of molecular targeting.","['Chihara, Dai', 'Ito, Hidemi', 'Matsuda, Tomohiro', 'Katanoda, Kota', 'Shibata, Akiko', 'Saika, Kumiko', 'Sobue, Tomotaka', 'Matsuo, Keitaro']","['Chihara D', 'Ito H', 'Matsuda T', 'Katanoda K', 'Shibata A', 'Saika K', 'Sobue T', 'Matsuo K']","['Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8681, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20120912,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Regression Analysis', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2012-0197 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0197 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2012;17(12):1547-50. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0197.

ABT-737 disturbed the binding of B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 homologous antagonist killer and Bcl-extra large; ATO downregulated myeloid cell leukaemia (Mcl)-1 protein and upregulated Mcl-1short, the short splicing variant. ABT-737 and ATO significantly suppressed SGC-7901 xenograft growth, synergistically inhibited tumour growth and induced apoptosis in vivo.

In addition, analytical separation and identification of proteins from complex mixtures can provide insight into targeted drug therapy and prediction of response to different therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: In the present review the authors summarize the readily available quantitative proteomics tools for the analytical separation and identification of target proteins in myeloid leukemia, AML in particular, and its future perspectives in its diagnostics and therapeutics. Within, the authors highlight some of the proteomics approaches such as gel-based quantitation strategies (2D, 2D-DIGE); MS-based quantitative proteomics tools (metabolic labeling (SILAC), chemical labeling (ITRAQ, ICAT)); MS techniques (MALDI-MS/MS). In addition, some of the target proteins identified using proteomics approaches in myeloid leukemia are also discussed that may encourage cancer biology investigators to undertake proteomics as a vital tool in their study. EXPERT OPINION: With suitable, selective application of diverse set of quantitative proteomics strategies integrated with bioinformatics software and precise statistical analysis in myeloid leukemia holds tremendous promise in deciphering cancer proteome, understanding tumor pathophysiology and development of personalized molecular medicine and therapy.","['Kapoor, Isha', 'Pal, Pooja', 'Lochab, Savita', 'Kanaujiya, Jitendra Kumar', 'Trivedi, Arun Kumar']","['Kapoor I', 'Pal P', 'Lochab S', 'Kanaujiya JK', 'Trivedi AK']","['CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, DTDD Division, Chattar Manzil, PB: 173, Lucknow, UP 226001, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120913,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical/*methods', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17460441.2012.724055 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2012 Dec;7(12):1165-75. doi: 10.1517/17460441.2012.724055.

Although molecularly targeted small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMI) are effective against many types of cancer, point mutations in the kinase domain impart drug resistance, a major challenge in the clinic. A classic example is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) caused by BCR-ABL fusion protein, wherein a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib (IM), was highly successful in the early chronic phase of the disease, but failed in the advanced stages due to amplification of oncogene or point mutations in the drug-binding site of kinase domain. Here, by identifying critical molecular pathways responsible for the drug-resistance in refractory CML patient samples and a model cell line, we have rationally designed an endogenous protein nanomedicine targeted to both cell surface receptors and aberrantly activated secondary kinase in the oncogenic network. Molecular diagnosis revealed that, in addition to point mutations and amplification of oncogenic BCR-ABL kinase, relapsed/refractory patients exhibited significant activation of STAT5 signaling with correlative overexpression of transferrin receptors (TfR) on the cell membrane. Accordingly, we have developed a human serum albumin (HSA) based nanomedicine, loaded with STAT5 inhibitor (sorafenib), and surface conjugated the same with holo-transferrin (Tf) ligands for TfR specific delivery. This dual-targeted ""transferrin conjugated albumin bound sorafenib"" nanomedicine (Tf-nAlb-Soraf), prepared using aqueous nanoprecipitation method, displayed uniform spherical morphology with average size of approximately 150 nm and drug encapsulation efficiency of approximately 74%. TfR specific uptake and enhanced antileukemic activity of the nanomedicine was found maximum in the most drug resistant patient sample having the highest level of STAT5 and TfR expression, thereby confirming the accuracy of our rational design and potential of dual-targeting approach. The nanomedicine induced downregulation of key survival pathways such as pSTAT5 and antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 was demonstrated using immunoblotting. This study reveals that, by implementing molecular diagnosis, personalized nanomedicines can be rationally designed and nanoengineered by imparting therapeutic functionality to endogenous proteins to overcome clinically important challenges like molecular drug resistance.","['Retnakumari, Archana P', 'Hanumanthu, Prasanna Lakshmi', 'Malarvizhi, Giridharan L', 'Prabhu, Raghuveer', 'Sidharthan, Neeraj', 'Thampi, Madhavan V', 'Menon, Deepthy', 'Mony, Ullas', 'Menon, Krishnakumar', 'Keechilat, Pavithran', 'Nair, Shantikumar', 'Koyakutty, Manzoor']","['Retnakumari AP', 'Hanumanthu PL', 'Malarvizhi GL', 'Prabhu R', 'Sidharthan N', 'Thampi MV', 'Menon D', 'Mony U', 'Menon K', 'Keechilat P', 'Nair S', 'Koyakutty M']","['Amrita Center for Nanosciences and Molecular Medicine, Amrita Vishwavidyapeetham University, Cochin, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121005,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Nanomedicine', '*Nanoparticles', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp300172e [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2012 Nov 5;9(11):3062-78. doi: 10.1021/mp300172e.

However, low or fragmented DNA yields from buccal cells collected using FTA cards often requires additional whole genome amplification to produce sufficient DNA for genotyping. In our case-control study of childhood leukaemia, discordance was found between genotypes derived from blood and whole genome amplified FTA buccal DNA samples. We aimed to develop a user-friendly method to correct for this genotype misclassification, as existing methods were not suitable for use in our study. METHODS: Discordance between the results of blood and buccal-derived DNA was assessed in childhood leukaemia cases who had both blood and FTA buccal samples. A method based on applying misclassification probabilities to measured data and combining results using multiple imputations, was devised to correct for error in the genotypes of control subjects, for whom only buccal samples were available, to minimize bias in the odds ratios in the case-control analysis. RESULTS: Application of the correction method to synthetic datasets showed it was effective in producing correct odds ratios from data with known misclassification. Moreover, when applied to each of six bi-allelic loci, correction altered the odds ratios in the logically anticipated manner given the degree and direction of the misclassification revealed by the investigations in cases. The precision of the effect estimates decreased with decreasing size of the misclassification data set. CONCLUSIONS: Bias arising from differential genotype misclassification can be reduced by correcting results using this method whenever data on concordance of genotyping results with those from a different and probably better DNA source are available.","['Cooper, Matthew N', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Greenop, Kathryn R', 'Jamieson, Sarra E', 'Anderson, Denise', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank M', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Cooper MN', 'de Klerk NH', 'Greenop KR', 'Jamieson SE', 'Anderson D', 'van Bockxmeer FM', 'Armstrong BK', 'Milne E']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, West Perth, 6872, WA, Australia. mcooper@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,"['0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA/analysis/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic']",2012/09/14 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/09/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-12-141 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-12-141 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2012 Sep 13;12:141. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-12-141.,PMC3514307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This group was compared with 25 healthy individuals (control group) similar to the ADRIA group with respect to age and body surface area (BSA). All individuals underwent treadmill exercise testing according to Bruce protocol. Echocardiograms were performed before and immediately after exercise. RESULTS: The groups were similar regarding cardiac structure and left ventricular (LV) systolic function at rest at T1 and T2. The growth of LV posterior wall thickness related to BSA was lower in the ADRIA group at T2. Post exercise, smaller LV ejection indexes and attenuated changes in the afterload in ADRIA group were observed at T1 and T2. CONCLUSION: The decreased systolic reserve induced by a low dose of anthracycline in asymptomatic children and adolescents remains unaffected over a 5-year period, suggesting that positive outcomes in chronic cardiotoxicity would be expected in patients with mild impairment after anthracycline treatment.","['Guimaraes-Filho, Fabio V', 'Tan, Doralice M', 'Braga, Joao C F', 'Rodrigues, Alexandre', 'Waib, Paulo H', 'Matsubara, Beatriz B']","['Guimaraes-Filho FV', 'Tan DM', 'Braga JC', 'Rodrigues A', 'Waib PH', 'Matsubara BB']","['Marilia Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil. fabio.icm@icm.com.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rest', 'Systole', 'Ventricular Function, Left/*drug effects']",2012/09/13 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24000 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Sep;59(3):548-52. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internal tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane region of FLT3 (FLT3/ITD) constitutively activate survival and proliferation pathways, and are associated with a poor prognosis in AML. We suspected that alteration of small non-coding microRNA (miRNA) expression in these leukemia cells is involved in the transformation process and used miRNA microarrays to determine the miRNA signature from total RNA harvested from FLT3/ITD expressing FDC-P1 cells (FD-FLT3/ITD). This revealed that a limited set of miRNAs appeared to be affected by expression of FLT3/ITD compared to the control group consisting of FDC-P1 parental cells transfected with an empty vector (FD-EV). Among differentially expressed miRNAs, we selected miR-16, miR-21 and miR-223 to validate the microarray data by quantitative real-time RT-PCR showing a high degree of correlation. We further analyzed miR-16 expression with FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3/ITD expressing cells. MiR-16 was found to be one of most significantly down-regulated miRNAs in FLT3/ITD expressing cells and was up-regulated upon FLT3 inhibition. The data suggests that miR-16 is acting as a tumour suppressor gene in FLT3/ITD-mediated leukemic transformation. Whilst miR-16 has been reported to target multiple mRNAs, computer models from public bioinformatic resources predicted a potential regulatory mechanism between miR-16 and Pim-1 mRNA. In support of this interaction, miR-16 was shown to suppress Pim-1 reporter gene expression. Further, our data demonstrated that over-expression of miR-16 mimics suppressed Pim-1 expression in FD-FLT3/ITD cells suggesting that increased miR-16 expression contributes to depletion of Pim-1 after FLT3 inhibition and that miR-16 repression may be associated with up-regulated Pim-1 in FLT3/ITD expressing cells.","['Kim, Kyu-Tae', 'Carroll, Adam P', 'Mashkani, Baratali', 'Cairns, Murray J', 'Small, Donald', 'Scott, Rodney J']","['Kim KT', 'Carroll AP', 'Mashkani B', 'Cairns MJ', 'Small D', 'Scott RJ']","['School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia. kyutae.kim@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120906,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn16 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044546 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-06742 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44546. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044546.

However, the mechanism of its action against leukemia remains unclear. In this study, the therapeutic potential of alpha-tomatine against leukemic cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability experiments showed that alpha-tomatine had significant cytotoxic effects on the human leukemia cancer cell lines HL60 and K562, and the cells were found to be in the Annexin V-positive/propidium iodide-negative phase of cell death. In addition, alpha-tomatine induced both HL60 and K562 cell apoptosis in a cell cycle- and caspase-independent manner. alpha-Tomatine exposure led to a loss of the mitochrondrial membrane potential, and this finding was consistent with that observed on activation of the Bak and Mcl-1 short form (Mcl-1s) proteins. Exposure to alpha-tomatine also triggered the release of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria into the nucleus and down-regulated survivin expression. Furthermore, alpha-tomatine significantly inhibited HL60 xenograft tumor growth without causing loss of body weight in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Immunohistochemical test showed that the reduced tumor growth in the alpha-tomatine-treated mice was a result of increased apoptosis, which was associated with increased translocation of AIF in the nucleus and decreased survivin expression ex vivo. These results suggest that alpha-tomatine may be a candidate for leukemia treatment.","['Chao, Min-Wu', 'Chen, Chun-Han', 'Chang, Ya-Ling', 'Teng, Che-Ming', 'Pan, Shiow-Lin']","['Chao MW', 'Chen CH', 'Chang YL', 'Teng CM', 'Pan SL']","['Phamacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120906,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (alpha-tomatine)', '31U6547O08 (Tomatine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Survivin', 'Tomatine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044093 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-04346 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44093. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044093.

The original process was inefficient; maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) and iPS cell cultures required an expensive reagent-leukemia induced factor (LIF). Our goal is to find a pure compound that not only maintains ES and iPS cell pluripotency, but also increases iPS cell generation efficiency. From 15 candidate compounds we determined that 10 microg/ml n-Butylidenephthalide (BP), an Angelica sinensis extract, triggers the up-regulation of Oct4 and Sox2 gene expression levels in MEF cells. We used ES and iPS cells treated with different concentrations of BP to test its usefulness for maintaining stem cell pluripotency. Results indicate higher expression levels of several stem cell markers in BP-treated ES and iPS cells compared to controls that did not contain LIF, including alkaline phosphatase, SSEA1, and Nanog. Embryoid body formation and differentiation results confirm that BP containing medium culture was capable of maintaining ES cell pluripotency after six time passage. Microarray analysis data identified PPAR, ECM, and Jak-Stat signaling as the top three deregulated pathways. We subsequently determined that phosphorylated Jak2 and phosphorylated Stat3 protein levels increased following BP treatment and suppressed with the Jak2 inhibitor, AG490. The gene expression levels of cytokines associated with the Jak2-Stat3 pathway were also up-regulated. Last, we used pou5f1-GFP MEF cells to test iPS generation efficiency following BP treatment. Our data demonstrate the ability of BP to maintain stem cell pluripotency via the Jak2-Stat3 pathway by inducing cytokine expression levels, at the same time improving iPS generation efficiency.","['Liu, Shih-Ping', 'Harn, Horng-Jyh', 'Chien, Ying-Jiun', 'Chang, Cheng-Hsuan', 'Hsu, Chien-Yu', 'Fu, Ru-Huei', 'Huang, Yu-Chuen', 'Chen, Shih-Yin', 'Shyu, Woei-Cherng', 'Lin, Shinn-Zong']","['Liu SP', 'Harn HJ', 'Chien YJ', 'Chang CH', 'Hsu CY', 'Fu RH', 'Huang YC', 'Chen SY', 'Shyu WC', 'Lin SZ']","['Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. spliu@mail.cmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Phthalic Anhydrides)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'S9178G4B3F (butylidenephthalide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phthalic Anhydrides/*pharmacology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Staining and Labeling']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044024 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-09564 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44024. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044024.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of action of one of the recently identified analogues, 4a (2-benzyl-6-(4'-fluorophenyl)-5-thiocyanato-imidazo[2,1-b][1], [3], [4]thiadiazole). MATERIALS AND METHODS: ROS production and expression of various apoptotic proteins were measured following 4a treatment in leukemia cell lines. Tumor animal models were used to evaluate the effect of 4a in comparison with Levamisole on progression of breast adenocarcinoma and survival. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting studies were performed to understand the mechanism of 4a action both ex vivo and in vivo. RESULTS: We have determined the IC(50) value of 4a in many leukemic and breast cancer cell lines and found CEM cells most sensitive (IC(50) 5 microM). Results showed that 4a treatment leads to the accumulation of ROS. Western blot analysis showed upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins t-BID and BAX, upon treatment with 4a. Besides, dose-dependent activation of p53 along with FAS, FAS-L, and cleavage of CASPASE-8 suggest that it induces death receptor mediated apoptotic pathway in CEM cells. More importantly, we observed a reduction in tumor growth and significant increase in survival upon oral administration of 4a (20 mg/kg, six doses) in mice. In comparison, 4a was found to be more potent than its parental analogue Levamisole based on both ex vivo and in vivo studies. Further, immunohistochemistry and western blotting studies indicate that 4a treatment led to abrogation of tumor cell proliferation and activation of apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway even in animal models. CONCLUSION: Thus, our results suggest that 4a could be used as a potent chemotherapeutic agent.","['Hegde, Mahesh', 'Karki, Subhas S', 'Thomas, Elizabeth', 'Kumar, Sujeet', 'Panjamurthy, Kuppusamy', 'Ranganatha, Somasagara R', 'Rangappa, Kanchugarakoppal S', 'Choudhary, Bibha', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Hegde M', 'Karki SS', 'Thomas E', 'Kumar S', 'Panjamurthy K', 'Ranganatha SR', 'Rangappa KS', 'Choudhary B', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120910,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', '*Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Levamisole/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043632 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-04857 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e43632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043632.

We used the cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)-resistant erythroleukaemia cell line K562 and the Ara-C-sensitive myeloid leukaemia cell line HL60 to examine the differential expression of molecular markers. We found increased expression levels of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) and decreased levels of multidrug resistance protein 5 (ABCC5) and ribonucleoside reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) expression in Ara-C-sensitive HL60 cells. We previously established the pemetrexed (MTA)-resistant small cell lung cancer cell lines PC6/MTA-0.4 and PC6/MTA-1.6 and found that MTA-resistant cells are more sensitive to gemcitabine (GEM) and Ara-C compared with parental PC-6 cells. We examined the molecular markers for GEM and Ara-C sensitivity in MTA-resistant cells and found increased gene expression of dCK and hENT1.

We investigated whether casein inhibited the in vitro proliferation and induced the apoptosis of the mouse myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line WEHI-3. By contrast, under identical conditions, casein markedly promotes the proliferation of mouse normal mononuclear bone marrow cells. Since the selective elimination of leukaemia cells is an ideal therapeutic strategy, we also evaluated the antileukaemic potential of casein in vivo. The results showed that casein increases the survival of mice bearing WEHI-3-induced tumours, suggesting that this molecule is also capable of inhibiting the proliferation of these cells in vivo.

The cell proliferation was then tested by MTT assay, and the cell differentiation was tested through light microscopy, by NBT test and flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein was observed by indirect immune fluorescent test. Results showed that ATRA inhibited the growth of NB4 cells, however, it could not inhibit the growth of NB4-R1 cells. IFN-gamma inhibited the growth of both NB4 and NB4-R1 cells. Meanwhile, the growth inhibition effect of IFN-gamma in combination with ATRA on both NB4 and NB4-R1 cells was significantly stronger than that of any single drug treatment. The results of the NBT reduction test and CD11b antigen detection by FCM indicated that IFN-gamma induces the differentiation of NB4 and NB4-R1 cells to some extent. Moreover, the maturation degree of both NB4 and NB4-R1 cells induced by IFN-gamma in combination with ATRA was more significant than that of IFN-gamma or ATRA alone. After treatment with IFN-gamma, the number of fluorescent particles in NB4 and NB4-R1 cell nuclei was higher than those in the control group, which indicated that IFN-gamma may induce the expression of PML protein. Together, IFN-gamma augments the proliferation inhibition effect of ATRA on NB4 and NB4-R1 cells through enhancing the expression of PML protein. IFN-gamma in combination with ATRA not only strengthens the induction differentiation effect of ATRA on NB4 cells, but also can partially induce the maturation of NB4-R1 cells with ATRA resistance.","['He, Pengcheng', 'Liu, Yanfeng', 'Zhang, Mei', 'Wang, Xiaoning', 'Xi, Jieying', 'Wu, DI', 'Li, Jing', 'Cao, Yunxin']","['He P', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang M', 'Wang X', 'Xi J', 'Wu D', 'Li J', 'Cao Y']","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061;""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120216,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,2012/09/13 06:00,2012/09/13 06:01,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2012.488 [doi]', 'etm-03-05-0776 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2012 May;3(5):776-780. doi: 10.3892/etm.2012.488.

The Wilm's tumour gene (WT1) has been suggested as a possible molecular marker of MRD in AML. The expression of WT1 in peripheral blood (PB) was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in peripheral leukocytes from 151 patients with AML at diagnosis. WT1 expression was significantly elevated, i.e. up to 3 orders of magnitude in the majority (80%) of AML patients at diagnosis compared to the PB of healthy donors. Sequence samples of the long-term followed-up AML patients treated with chemotherapy and/or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were analysed for WT1 expression. The results revealed that the hematological relapses were preceded (median, 1.8 months) by an increase in WT1 gene expression. For the practical utility of this gene as a molecular marker of relapse, it was necessary to determine an upper remission limit, crossing which would signal hematological relapse. The upper remission limit was determined in our set of patients to be 0.02 WT1/ABL. The AML patients who consequently relapsed crossed this upper remission limit; however, those in permanent remission did not. Therefore, this upper remission limit could be taken as the border of molecular relapse of AML patients. Moreover, insufficient decline of WT1 expression under the upper remission limit following induction and/or consolidation therapy was associated with markedly high risk of relapse. The results show that our upper remission limit can be taken as the border of molecular relapse of AML patients and WT1 levels following initial therapy as a beneficial prognostic marker.","['Polak, Jaroslav', 'Hajkova, Hana', 'Maalaufova-Soukupova, Jacqueline', 'Markova, Jana', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Schwarz, Jiri', 'Haskovec, Cedrik']","['Polak J', 'Hajkova H', 'Maalaufova-Soukupova J', 'Markova J', 'Salek C', 'Schwarz J', 'Haskovec C']",['Department of Molecular Genetics;'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111011,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,2012/09/13 06:00,2012/09/13 06:01,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2011.363 [doi]', 'etm-03-01-0129 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2012 Jan;3(1):129-133. doi: 10.3892/etm.2011.363.

Cells treated with KEO or linalool for 48 h showed significantly suppressed cell proliferation, with induced apoptosis. Moreover, KEO and linalool promoted cell differentiation. Treatment with KEO cells at the same dose as linalool showed an almost identical effect on HL-60 cells. These results suggest that KEO and linalool have efficacy as anticancer therapeutic products.","['Maeda, Hayato', 'Yamazaki, Mao', 'Katagata, Yohtaro']","['Maeda H', 'Yamazaki M', 'Katagata Y']","['Faculty of Agriculture and Life Science, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8561, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110927,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,2012/09/13 06:00,2012/09/13 06:01,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2011.357 [doi]', 'etm-03-01-0049 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2012 Jan;3(1):49-52. doi: 10.3892/etm.2011.357.

A variety of animal models have contributed to the fundamental knowledge of HTLV-1 transmission, pathogenesis, and to the design of novel therapies to treat HTLV-1-associated diseases. Small animal models (rabbits, rats, and mice) as well as large animal models (monkeys) have been utilized to significantly advance characterization of the viral proteins and of virus-infected cells in the early steps of infection, as well as in the development of leukemogenic and immunopathogenic processes. Over the past two decades, the creation of new immunocompromised mouse strains that are robustly reconstituted with a functional human immune system (HIS) after being transplanted with human tissues or progenitor cells has revolutionized the in vivo investigation of viral infection and pathogenesis. Recent observations obtained in HTLV-1-infected humanized HIS mice that develop lymphomas provide the opportunity to study the evolution of the proviral clonality in human T cells present in different lymphoid organs.

Critical white blood cell (WBC) counts are conventionally defined as higher than 100 x 10(9)/l in acute myeloid leukemia and > 300 x 10(9)/l in acute lymphatic leukemia and other leukemic disorders (e. g. chronic myeloid leukemia). Leukocytapheresis is a therapeutic tool to reduce leukocyte counts in patients with symptomatic or threatening leukostasis until induction chemotherapy works. In patients with temporary contraindications against cytotoxic drugs, e.g. during pregnancy, leukocytapheresis can be used as a bridging therapy until conventional chemotherapy can be started. Therapeutic leukocytapheresis should be performed in specialized centers by experienced, well-trained staff. Thorough monitoring of the patients is extremely relevant. During a single procedure, WBC count can be reduced by 10-70%. Treatment should be repeated daily and can be discontinued when the symptoms of leukostasis have been resolved and/or leukocyte counts have fallen below the critical thresholds. There are no prospective studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of therapeutic leukocytapheresis in patients with hyperleukocytosis. It can be concluded from retrospective studies that leukocytapheresis might have some beneficial effect in early morbidity and mortality of patients with newly diagnosed AML but has no influence on overall long-term survival.

One of the most enriched DNA elements in promoters and enhancers of genes specifically active in ESCs is the CCAAT box, which is recognized by NF-Y, a trimer with histone-like subunits--NF-YB/NF--YC--and the sequence-specific NF-YA. We show that the levels of the short NF-YA isoform--NF-YAs--is high in mouse ESCs (mESCs) and drops after differentiation; a dominant negative mutant affects expression of important stem cells genes, directly and indirectly. Protein transfections of TAT-NF-YAs stimulate growth and compensate for withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in cell cultures. Bioinformatic analysis identifies NF-Y sites as highly enriched in genomic loci of stem TFs in ESCs. Specifically, 30%-50% of NANOG peaks have NF-Y sites and indeed NF-Y-binding is required for NANOG association to DNA. These data indicate that NF-Y belongs to the restricted circle of TFs that govern mESCs, and, specifically, that NF-YAs is the active isoform in these cells.","['Dolfini, Diletta', 'Minuzzo, Mario', 'Pavesi, Giulio', 'Mantovani, Roberto']","['Dolfini D', 'Minuzzo M', 'Pavesi G', 'Mantovani R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomolecolari e Biotecnologie, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Klf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Nfya protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1232 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Nov;30(11):2450-9. doi: 10.1002/stem.1232.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,

Stat3 has only been shown to promote complete reprogramming of epiblast and neural stem cells and partially reprogrammed cells (pre-iPSCs). We investigated if and how Jak/Stat3 activation promotes reprogramming of terminally differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We demonstrated that activated Stat3 not only promotes but also is essential for the pluripotency establishment of MEFs during reprogramming. We further demonstrated that during this process, inhibiting Jak/Stat3 activity blocks demethylation of Oct4 and Nanog regulatory elements in induced cells, which are marked by suppressed endogenous pluripotent gene expression. These are correlated with the significant upregulation of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) expression as well as the increased expression of lysine-specific histone demethylase 2 and methyl CpG binding protein 2. Inhibiting Jak/Stat3 also blocks the expression of Dnmt3L, which is correlated with the failure of retroviral transgene silencing. Furthermore, Dnmt or HDAC inhibitor but not overexpression of Nanog significantly rescues the reprogramming arrested by Jak/Stat3 inhibition or LIF deprivation. Finally, we demonstrated that LIF/Stat3 signal also represents the prerequisite for complete reprogramming of pre-iPSCs. We conclude that Jak/Stat3 activity plays a fundamental role to promote pluripotency establishment at the epigenetic level, by facilitating DNA demethylation/de novo methylation, and open-chromatin formation during late-stage reprogramming.","['Tang, Yong', 'Luo, Yan', 'Jiang, Zongliang', 'Ma, Yinghong', 'Lin, Chih-Jen', 'Kim, Chul', 'Carter, Mark G', 'Amano, Tomokazu', 'Park, Joonghong', 'Kish, Sharon', 'Tian, Xiuchun Cindy']","['Tang Y', 'Luo Y', 'Jiang Z', 'Ma Y', 'Lin CJ', 'Kim C', 'Carter MG', 'Amano T', 'Park J', 'Kish S', 'Tian XC']","['Center for Regenerative Biology, Department of Animal Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Epigenomics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Janus Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1225 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Dec;30(12):2645-56. doi: 10.1002/stem.1225.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,

Histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACis) are promising novel tools for cancer therapy, whose anti-tumor effects and the underlying mechanisms on B-ALL remain to be elucidated. Recently, Notch1 signaling activation has been reported to be involved in the anti-tumor effects of HDACis. This study was conducted to determine: the influence of two HDACis, valproic acid (VPA) and suberic bishydroxamic acid (SBHA), on Notch1 signaling as well as the role of Notch1 signaling in the anti-tumor effects of HDACis in B-ALL cells. To address this issue, we treated Nalm-6 B-ALL cell line with VPA and SBHA (HDACis), then, cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and expression of Notch1 related genes were analyzed. We found that VPA and SBHA dramatically inhibited cell growth, induced a G1/S cell cycle block in accompany with an elevated level of P21(WAF1) protein in Nalm-6 cells. The levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP were elevated, indicating the activation of apoptosis. However, no change in the expression of Notch1 and its downstream genes were found by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Our result suggested that Notch1 signaling is irresponsible for the anti-leukemic effect of HDACis in B-ALL cells.

METHODS: The National Registry of Childhood Tumours provided all cases of childhood leukaemia born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 2006. Controls were matched on sex, period of birth and birth registration subdistrict. Fathers' occupations were assigned to 1 or more of 33 exposure groups. Social class was derived from father's occupation at the time of the child's birth. RESULTS: A total of 16 764 cases of childhood leukaemia were ascertained. One exposure group, paternal social contact, was associated with total childhood leukaemia (odds ratio 1.14, 1.05-1.23); this association remained significant when adjusted for social class. The subtypes lymphoid leukaemia (LL) and acute myeloid leukaemia showed increased risk with paternal exposure to social contact before adjustment for social class. Risk of other leukaemias was significantly increased by exposure to electromagnetic fields, persisting after adjustment for social class. For total leukaemia, the risks for exposure to lead and exhaust fumes were significantly <1. Occupationally derived social class was associated with risk of LL, with the risk being increased in the higher social classes. CONCLUSION: Our results showed some support for a positive association between childhood leukaemia risk and paternal occupation involving social contact. Additionally, LL risk increased with higher paternal occupational social class.","['Keegan, T J', 'Bunch, K J', 'Vincent, T J', 'King, J C', ""O'Neill, K A"", 'Kendall, G M', 'MacCarthy, A', 'Fear, N T', 'Murphy, M F G']","['Keegan TJ', 'Bunch KJ', 'Vincent TJ', 'King JC', ""O'Neill KA"", 'Kendall GM', 'MacCarthy A', 'Fear NT', 'Murphy MF']","['Faculty of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University, Faraday Building, Lancaster, LA1 4YD, UK. t.keegan@lancs.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Occupations/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/03/22 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012359 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.359 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Oct 23;107(9):1652-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.359.

We investigated the roles of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (ERCC5rs76871136, ERCC5rs77569659, ERCC5rs873601, XPCrs2228000, XPCrs2228001, and XPCrs1870134) in the nucleotide excision repair pathway in influencing the outcome of patients with AML treated with cytosine arabinoside-based chemotherapy. One hundred fifty-one patients with AML in a Chinese population were enrolled in this study. Genotypes were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found that the distribution of three genotypes of XPCrs1870134 significantly differed in the cytogenetic risk groups (P = 0.04). A statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms of XPCrs2228001 and gender was found among the gender groups (P = 0.03). Moreover, patients carrying at least one variant allele (XPCrs2228001AA+CC) were more likely to respond better than those who did not carry a variant. However, no significant association was detected between polymorphisms in ERCC5 and treatment response. These findings suggest that XPC polymorphisms are important markers for the outcome of patients with AML in the Chinese population.","['Xu, Peipei', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Feng, Jifeng', 'Cheng, Lu', 'Xia, Guohua', 'Li, Yufeng', 'Qian, Jun', 'Ding, Jiahua', 'Lu, Zuhong']","['Xu P', 'Chen B', 'Feng J', 'Cheng L', 'Xia G', 'Li Y', 'Qian J', 'Ding J', 'Lu Z']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Dingjiaqiao 87, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120912,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA excision repair protein ERCC-5)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '156533-34-5 (XPC protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Asians/genetics', 'China', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endonucleases/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1145-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Oct;96(4):450-60. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1145-3.

Here, we have performed a high-resolution analysis of KIR expression on CD8 T cells. The results show that most CD8 T cells possess a restricted KIR expression pattern, often dominated by a single activating or inhibitory KIR. Furthermore, the expression of KIR, and its modulation of CD8 T-cell function, was independent of expression of self-HLA class I ligands. Finally, despite similarities in the stochastic regulation of KIRs by the bidirectional proximal promoter, the specificity of inhibitory KIRs on CD8 T cells was often distinct from that of natural killer cells in the same individual.

To date, there has been no integrated analysis based on grade, phenotype, and genotype from large numbers of FL cases in a representative Chinese population. In this study, we graded 98 FL cases; fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to determine the BCL2 and BCL6 translocation statuses, and these were compared with morphologic and immunohistochemical parameters. The expressions of the 4 antigens were B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)-2(88.8%), BCL-6(80.6%), CD10(62.2%), and Ki67(50.0%), respectively. The frequencies of BCL2 and BCL6 translocations were 58.5% and 16.3%. In conclusion, the incidence of IgH/BCL2-positive FL in Chinese patients is relatively lower compared with that in western countries. BCL2 translocation strongly correlated with CD10 and Ki67 expression. Our data confirm the presence of a relationship between the translocation status and the FL histologic grade. All BCL6 translocations occurred in high-grade FL, and this suggests that FL carrying BCL6 translocation probably constitute a special biological subtype.","['Pan, Yi', 'Meng, Bin', 'Sun, Baocun', 'Guan, Bingxin', 'Liang, Yan', 'Wang, Huaqing', 'Hao, Xishan', 'Fu, Kai']","['Pan Y', 'Meng B', 'Sun B', 'Guan B', 'Liang Y', 'Wang H', 'Hao X', 'Fu K']","['Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Oncogene Fusion/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Tissue Array Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PDM.0b013e3182585c3c [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2012 Dec;21(4):234-40. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e3182585c3c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 45 patients with refractory/recurrent AML were enrolled from September 2006 to April 2010. The median blasts in bone marrow (BM) were 36% (20% to 92%) before conditioning. The donors were identical siblings (6) or unrelated ones (9) or haploidentical family members (30). Conditioning regiments were individualized according to patients' status, the regimen with high-dose cytarabine plus BuCy/CY was mostly used (20). The patients with impaired organ function received above regimen except using fludarabine instead of cyclophosphamide (16). FLAG followed by reduced-intensified BuCy was employed for the recipients with more than 40% blasts in BM (6) to reduce leukemia burden. TBI/CY or TBI/Fludarabine was used for the recipients with extramedullary infiltration of leukemia or multidrug resistant leukemia.

Both the resistant and the parental cell lines were similar with regard to morphology and immunophenotype. The karyotypes of the former was more complicated with differences located in chromosome 20, X, 4, 5, 9 and 11.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the determinants of insulin resistance (IR) observed in this population, according to the treatment received. METHODS: Ninety one patients (45 men, mean age: 24 +/- 5 years; mean follow-up: 15 +/- 5 years) previously treated for a childhood ALL (n = 76) or NHL (n = 15) were grouped according to their previous treatment: chemotherapy only (Group I; n = 43), chemotherapy + cranial irradiation (CI) (Group II; n = 32) and chemotherapy + bone marrow transplant (BMT)/total body irradiation (TBI) (Group III, n = 16). RESULTS: A high prevalence of IR (HOMA-S < 60%) was observed in the BMT/TBI group (88%) compared to groups I (9%) and II (16%). The IR patients from groups [I+II] (12% of these groups) showed higher BMI, fat mass (FM) and visceral fat when compared with the non-IR patients. In contrast, the IR patients from group III had mean BMI and total FM similar to those of non-IR patients but showed a reduction of lean body mass and an increase in the relative proportion of trunk FM similar to the IR patients from groups [I + II]. This was associated with an altered lipid profile, high TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, and reduced adiponectin levels compared to IR patients from group [I + II] and non-IR patients. CONCLUSION: Childhood ALL/NHL survivors treated by BMT/TBI frequently develop severe insulin resistance associated with peripheral-to-central fat redistribution, rather than increased total FM, and low adiponectin levels which may contribute to their increased CV risk.","['Beauloye, Veronique', 'Steffens, Melanie', 'Zech, Francis', 'Vermylen, Christiane', 'Maiter, Dominique']","['Beauloye V', 'Steffens M', 'Zech F', 'Vermylen C', 'Maiter D']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Cliniques St-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium. veronique.beauloye@uclouvain.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cen.12047 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2013 May;78(5):790-8. doi: 10.1111/cen.12047.,,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,

The oncoprotein B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 protein (Bmi-1) has been linked to the development and progression of glioma; however, the biological role of Bmi-1 in the invasion of glioma remains unclear. METHODS: A172 and LN229 glioma cells were engineered to overexpress Bmi-1 via stable transfection or to be silenced for Bmi-1 expression using RNA interfering method. Migration and invasiveness of the engineered cells were assessed using wound healing assay, Transwell migration assay, Transwell matrix penetration assay and 3-D spheroid invasion assay. MMP-9 expression and activity were measured using real-time PCR, ELISA and the gelatin zymography methods. Expression of NF-kappaB target genes was quantified using real-time PCR. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was assessed using an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter system. Expression of Bmi-1 and MMP-9 in clinical specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemical assay. RESULTS: Ectopic overexpression of Bmi-1 dramatically increased, whereas knockdown of endogenous Bmi-1 reduced, the invasiveness and migration of glioma cells. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and MMP-9 expression and activity were significantly increased in Bmi-1-overexpressing but reduced in Bmi-1-silenced cells. The reporter luciferase activity driven by MMP-9 promoter in Bmi-1-overexpressing cells was dependent on the presence of a functional NF-kappaB binding site, and blockade of NF-kappaB signaling inhibited the upregulation of MMP-9 in Bmi-1 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, expression of Bmi-1 correlated with NF-kappaB nuclear translocation as well as MMP-9 expression in clinical glioma samples. CONCLUSIONS: Bmi-1 may play an important role in the development of aggressive phenotype of glioma via activating the NF-kappaB/MMP-9 pathway and therefore might represent a novel therapeutic target for glioma.","['Jiang, Lili', 'Wu, Jueheng', 'Yang, Yi', 'Liu, Liping', 'Song, Libing', 'Li, Jun', 'Li, Mengfeng']","['Jiang L', 'Wu J', 'Yang Y', 'Liu L', 'Song L', 'Li J', 'Li M']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510182, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (MMP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glioma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phenotype', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-406 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-406 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Sep 11;12:406. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-406.,PMC3502583,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary intake of folate, vitamins B6 and B12 in the last 6 mo of pregnancy from 333 cases and 695 frequency-matched controls were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Data were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for study matching variables, total energy, and potentially confounding variables. Higher levels of dietary folate and B12 appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of ALL. Higher levels of vitamin B6 were associated with an increased risk. The strongest associations of ALL with these variables were seen when mothers consumed alcohol in pregnancy. Our findings are consistent with a modest protective effect of higher dietary intake of folate and vitamin B12 against ALL in the offspring, more particularly among women who drank alcohol during pregnancy. These findings are consistent with previous reports of the protective effects of a maternal diet high in fruit, vegetables, and nondairy protein sources. The vitamin B6 findings are not consistent with evidence that it is a protective factor against other cancers, and may be a chance finding.","['Bailey, Helen D', 'Miller, Margaret', 'Langridge, Amanda', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank M', 'Attia, John', 'Scott, Rodney J', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Bailey HD', 'Miller M', 'Langridge A', 'de Klerk NH', 'van Bockxmeer FM', 'Attia J', 'Scott RJ', 'Armstrong BK', 'Milne E']","['The University of Western Australia, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, Perth, Australia. helenb@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['8059-24-3 (Vitamin B 6)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Logistic Models', '*Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vitamin B 12/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vitamin B 6/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/03/28 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2012.707278 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2012;64(7):1122-30. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2012.707278.

In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a large number of clinical studies have established the 375 mg/m(2) dose of rituximab as standard. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), response rates to single-agent rituximab at the NHL dose were low, but the use of higher doses or more frequent dosing have led to improved response rates, suggesting that a higher dose may be required. This led to the empiric decision to adopt rituximab at 500 mg/m(2) in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) in phase II and III trials in CLL. The final result was the approval of rituximab at 500 mg/m(2) for treatment of CLL, in combination with FC. There is, however, preclinical evidence that full saturation of CD20 molecules may not be required to achieve chemosensitization in cancer cells, and it remains possible that the approved dose of 500 mg/m(2) is higher than what is required to achieve maximal in vivo synergy. Nevertheless, all of the randomized evidence for superiority of rituximab plus chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone comes from studies using the 500 mg/m(2) dose.","['Tam, Constantine S', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tam CS', 'Keating MJ']","[""Haematology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St Andrew's Place, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. constantine.tam@petermac.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120928,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/13 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2012/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.728595 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 May;54(5):934-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.728595.

The broad range of abnormalities across different AML subtypes suggests that improvements in clinical outcome will require the development of targeted therapies for each subtype of disease and the design of novel clinical trials to test these strategies.

In the comparative study, the P53 mutation was detected more frequently when using cDNA sequencing than DNA sequencing in all of the cancer types. Furthermore, several samples presented missense P53 mutations, with visible wild-type nucleotide on the DNA sequence.

Pterodon pubescens is a native Brazilian plant popularly known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects.

This study investigated the in vitro anti-leukemic properties of EEPp using the resistant human leukemia cell line K562. The EEPp anti-proliferative effect was demonstrated by the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell growth, and the induction of cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase. Furthermore, cyclin E2 mRNA levels were down-regulated, while those of cyclin D1 were up-regulated. An EEPp anti-leukemic effect may have also triggered apoptosis, as it increased the number of shrunken cells and phosphatidylserine cell membrane exposure. These observations suggest that EEPp deregulates cyclin D1 and E2 expression, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of leukemic cells.","['Pereira, Monica Farah', 'DE Almeida Simao, Tatiana', 'Dalmau, Sergio Ranto', 'Albano, Rodolpho Mattos', 'Coelho, Marsen Garcia Pinto', 'DE Carvalho Sabino, Katia Costa']","['Pereira MF', 'DE Almeida Simao T', 'Dalmau SR', 'Albano RM', 'Coelho MG', 'DE Carvalho Sabino KC']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, CEP-20550-170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100501,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,2010/05/01 00:00,2010/05/01 00:01,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol_00000094 [doi]', 'ol-01-03-0533 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2010 May;1(3):533-536. doi: 10.3892/ol_00000094.

The mechanisms by which glucocorticoids are active in CLL are not well elucidated. We aimed to ascertain the activity of dexamethasone in CLL cells according to prognosis and to identify the molecular mechanisms that are influencing the response to this drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sensitivity to dexamethasone was analyzed ex vivo in 50 CLL and compared according to IGHV mutational status and/or ZAP-70 expression. The response was further compared by gene expression profiling (GEP) of selected cases. Expression of genes of interest was validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. RESULTS: Response to dexamethasone was higher in cases with unmutated IGHV/high ZAP-70 expression, and the levels of induction of the pro-apoptotic Bim protein correlated with the degree of cell death. GEP analysis showed few genes differentially expressed after dexamethasone treatment between mutated and unmutated cases. However, functional annotation analysis showed that unmutated cases had significant enrichment in terms related to apoptosis. Specific analysis of genes of interest conducted in a large series disclosed that in unmutated IGHV cells, FKBP5 expression was higher at baseline and after dexamethasone exposure and that GILZ was more induced by dexamethasone treatment in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Unmutated IGHV/high ZAP-70 CLL cells exhibit better response to dexamethasone treatment, which is accompanied by a differential expression of genes involved in the glucocorticoid receptor pathway and by an increased induction of genes related to apoptosis.","['Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Muntanola, Ana', 'Calpe, Eva', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Salamero, Olga', 'Fernandez, Eva', 'Codony, Carles', 'Gine, Eva', 'Kalko, Susana G', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Baptista MJ', 'Muntanola A', 'Calpe E', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Salamero O', 'Fernandez E', 'Codony C', 'Gine E', 'Kalko SG', 'Crespo M', 'Bosch F']","[""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120910,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TSC22D3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (tacrolimus binding protein 5)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcriptome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2771 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2771 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Nov 1;18(21):5924-33. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2771.

RESULTS: Of 2,995 evaluable patients aged 16 to 60 years, 290 patients were randomly assigned to the common standard arm. Seventy percent of the 290 achieved complete remissions (62% with complete recovery, 8% with incomplete recovery; 95% CI, 65% to 76%). Five-year survival probabilities were 44.3% (95% CI, 37.7% to 50.7%) for overall survival, 44.8% (95% CI, 37.0% to 52.2%) for relapse-free survival, and 31.5% (95% CI, 25.7% to 37.4%) for event-free survival. Neither the unadjusted survival probabilities of the Kaplan-Meier method nor their adjustment for prognostic variables in multiple Cox regression models led to statistically significant different results in the three survival end points when the outcomes of each study were compared with the standard arm. CONCLUSION: A strictly prospective comparison of different treatment strategies in patients with AML did not show clinically relevant outcome differences when compared through a common standard treatment arm. The results provide a representative basis for further therapeutic approaches.","['Buchner, Thomas', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Krahl, Rainer', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Krug, Utz', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Scholl, Sebastian', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Hoffmann, Verena S', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Niederwieser, Dietger W', 'Pfirrmann, Markus']","['Buchner T', 'Schlenk RF', 'Schaich M', 'Dohner K', 'Krahl R', 'Krauter J', 'Heil G', 'Krug U', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A', 'Spath D', 'Kramer M', 'Scholl S', 'Berdel WE', 'Hiddemann W', 'Hoelzer D', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hasford J', 'Hoffmann VS', 'Dohner H', 'Ehninger G', 'Ganser A', 'Niederwieser DW', 'Pfirrmann M']","['Department of Internal Medicine A-Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of Munster, Albert-Schweitzer Campus 1, Geb.

Response can now be assessed by minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring with flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We determined the relation among the results of these approaches and their prognostic value. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the multicenter AML02 study, follow-up bone marrow samples from 203 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed AML were examined by flow cytometry (n = 1,514), morphology (n = 1,382), and PCR amplification of fusion transcripts (n = 508). Results were correlated with treatment outcome. RESULTS: Among 1,215 samples with less than 5% leukemic myeloblasts by morphology, 100 (8.2%) were MRD positive (>/= 0.1%) by flow cytometry, whereas 96 (57.5%) of the 167 samples with >/= 5% blasts were MRD negative. Virtually all (308 of 311; 99.0%) MRD-negative samples by PCR were also MRD negative by flow cytometry. However, only 19 (9.6%) of the 197 PCR-positive samples were flow cytometry positive, with analyses of AML1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 accounting for most discrepancies, whereas eight of 13 MLL-positive samples had detectable MRD by flow cytometry. MRD by flow cytometry after induction 1 or 2 predicted lower event-free survival and higher relapse rate (P < .001) and was an independent prognostic factor in a multivariable analysis; prediction was not improved by morphologic information or molecular findings. CONCLUSION: In childhood AML, morphologic assessment of treatment response has limited value if MRD is measured by flow cytometry. MLL fusion transcripts can provide prognostic information in some patients, whereas monitoring of AML1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 transcripts is largely uninformative.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Wang, Kathleen Y', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Jacobsen, Jeffrey', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Degar, Barbara', 'Leung, Wing', 'Downing, James R', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Campana, Dario']","['Inaba H', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Cao X', 'Pounds SB', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Wang KY', 'Raimondi SC', 'Onciu M', 'Jacobsen J', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Dahl GV', 'Bowman WP', 'Taub JW', 'Degar B', 'Leung W', 'Downing JR', 'Pui CH', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Oncology, MS 260, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120910,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2012/09/12 06:00,2012/12/20 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.41.5323 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.41.5323 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Oct 10;30(29):3625-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.41.5323.

The main aims of this first-in-human trial were to determine maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of APR-246. PATIENTS AND METHODS: APR-246 was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion once per day for 4 consecutive days in 22 patients with hematologic malignancies and prostate cancer. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 7) and prostate cancer (n = 7) were the most frequent diagnoses. Starting dose was 2 mg/kg with dose escalations up to 90 mg/kg. RESULTS: MTD was defined as 60 mg/kg. The drug was well tolerated, and the most common adverse effects were fatigue, dizziness, headache, and confusion. DLTs were increased ALT/AST (n = 1), dizziness, confusion, and sensory disturbances (n = 2). PK showed little interindividual variation and were neither dose nor time dependent; terminal half-life was 4 to 5 hours. Tumor cells showed cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and upregulation of p53 target genes in several patients. Global gene expression analysis revealed changes in genes regulating proliferation and cell death. One patient with AML who had a p53 core domain mutation showed a reduction of blast percentage from 46% to 26% in the bone marrow, and one patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with a p53 splice site mutation showed a minor response. CONCLUSION: We conclude that APR-246 is safe at predicted therapeutic plasma levels, shows a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and can induce p53-dependent biologic effects in tumor cells in vivo.","['Lehmann, Soren', 'Bykov, Vladimir J N', 'Ali, Dina', 'Andren, Ove', 'Cherif, Honar', 'Tidefelt, Ulf', 'Uggla, Bertil', 'Yachnin, Jeffrey', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Moshfegh, Ali', 'Paul, Christer', 'Wiman, Klas G', 'Andersson, Per-Ola']","['Lehmann S', 'Bykov VJ', 'Ali D', 'Andren O', 'Cherif H', 'Tidefelt U', 'Uggla B', 'Yachnin J', 'Juliusson G', 'Moshfegh A', 'Paul C', 'Wiman KG', 'Andersson PO']","['Department of Hematology, M54, Karolinska University Hospital, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

The objective of this study was to determine whether molecular monitoring using PB was comparable to using BM for CML. A comparative study was performed that analyzed the Q-PCR results of 712 simultaneous PB and BM samples from 330 patients before and during imatinib therapy. For the 78 paired pretreatment samples, the level of BCR-ABL mRNA in PB was lower than that in BM (P = 0.007). Although the overall amounts of BCR-ABL mRNA in the PB and BM were comparable (P= 0.072) and there was a strong correlation (r = 0.839, P < 0.001) with the 634 paired on-treatment samples, the depth of the molecular response in PB was lower than that in BM (P < 0.001). The level of BCR-ABL mRNA in PB was lower than that in BM where the BM BCR-ABL mRNA < 1 log reduction (P < 0.001) or >/= 1-< 2 log-reductions (P = 0.008) from the baseline, and higher than that where the BM BCR-ABL mRNA >/= 2 log-reductions (P < 0.001). A strong correlation (r = 0.811, P < 0.001) was only found where the BM BCR-ABL mRNA < 1 log reduction. We conclude that the differences and correlations of BCR-ABL mRNA between PB and BM assays depend on the depth of the molecular response in BM for CML during imatinib therapy.","['Jiang, Qian', 'Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Jiang Q', 'Zhao XY', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu YR', 'Lai YY', 'Jiang B', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/blood/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23321 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Dec;87(12):1065-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23321.

Management of head and neck cancer in the setting of FA is complicated by pancytopenia, poor tolerance of chemotherapy, and potentially increased radiosensitivity. There are limited reports on tolerance of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with FA. METHODS: We report a case of a patient with FA who presented with a small oral tongue cancer that was excised. He rapidly developed extensive locoregional recurrence and underwent surgical resection followed by postoperative RT with concurrent cetuximab. RESULTS: Both RT and cetuximab were well tolerated with manageable toxicities. Unfortunately, the patient died of early locoregional disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: RT with concurrent cetuximab was well tolerated and may be an appropriate option in patients with FA.

MCL is highly refractory to most chemotherapy including newer antibody-based therapeutic approaches, and high-grade MCL has one of the worst survival rates among NHLs. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance of MCL is important. In this article, we tested the effects of arsenic trioxide (As(2) O(3) , ATO) in bortezomib-resistant MCL. ATO is reported to induce complete remission in the patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. Their effects in MCL, however, have not been explored. In this report, we show that ATO effectively inhibited the growth of MCL cells in vitro. ATO treatment also reduced cyclin D1 expression which is a genetic hallmark of MCL and NF-kB expression which was reported to have a prosurvival role in some MCL cells. The induction of apoptosis in MCL was partially due to reduced levels of cyclin D1 and increased levels of apoptosis-related molecules. The antiproliferative effects of bortezomib on MCL greatly increased when the cells were also treated with ATO, indicating ATO can sensitize MCL to bortezomib. Similar results were noted in bortezomib-resistant cell lines. In conclusion, ATO may be an alternative drug for use in combined adjuvant therapies for MCL, and further clinical testing should be performed.","['Jung, Hyun Joo', 'Chen, Zheng', 'McCarty, Nami']","['Jung HJ', 'Chen Z', 'McCarty N']","['Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases (IMM) University of Texas-Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23317 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Dec;87(12):1057-64. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23317.

We explored the differences by scrutinizing a case of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Assessment reports of GO were retrieved form the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Japanese regulatory agency, and we also reviewed published clinical trials. While GO was approved by the US FDA under the accelerated approval program in 2000, it was withdrawn from the market in 2010, based on the required post-marketing commitment failure. The EMA refused granting marketing authorization for GO in 2008 on the grounds that there were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs). GO was approved as an orphan drug in Japan in 2005, and the Japanese regulatory authority decided to continue with the approval in 2010 on the condition that post-marketing surveillance is strengthened. Under these situations, promising new results of RCTs appeared in 2011, and the role of GO in AML treatment was refocused worldwide. The stringent regulation may not be suitable in case of an orphan drug of targeted therapy, and more room should be kept to facilitate effective developments of new anti-neoplastic agents.","['Tanimoto, Tetsuya', 'Tsubokura, Masaharu', 'Mori, Jinichi', 'Pietrek, Monika', 'Ono, Shunsuke', 'Kami, Masahiro']","['Tanimoto T', 'Tsubokura M', 'Mori J', 'Pietrek M', 'Ono S', 'Kami M']","['Division of Social Communication System for Advanced Clinical Research, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 108-8639, Shirokanedai 4-6-1, Tokyo, Japan. tetanimot@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120911,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Approval', 'Europe', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Government Agencies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-012-9877-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2013 Apr;31(2):473-8. doi: 10.1007/s10637-012-9877-8.

Therefore the effect of corchorusin-D (COR-D), a compound isolated from Corchorus acutangulus, was studied in the chronic myelogenous leukemic cell line K562, using MTT assay, phase contrast and confocal microscopy, annexin V binding, cell cycle analysis and western blotting. COR-D inhibited cell growth in K562 cells and showed increased number of Annexin V FITC binding cells. Characteristic apoptotic changes, seen under phase contrast and confocal microscopes with accumulation of cells in the sub-G0 phase. The apoptosis involved drop in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c in cytosol followed by activation of caspases 9 and 3, and cleavage of PARP. Down-regulation of pro-caspase 10 was observed along with formation of death-inducing signaling complex between TNF-R1 and TRADD. COR-D suppressed PDK1 and AKT with activation of MAP kinase family members ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38. Thus it induced apoptosis by activating mitochondrial and death receptor pathways and suppressing AKT/PKB rather than MAP kinase pathway. Significant enhancement of apoptosis, noted using specific inhibitors of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1/2, suggests that COR-D can enhance apoptosis in K562 cells in combination with MAP kinase inhibitors.","['Mallick, Sumana', 'Pal, Bikas C', 'Vedasiromoni, Joseph R', 'Kumar, Deepak', 'Saha, Krishna D']","['Mallick S', 'Pal BC', 'Vedasiromoni JR', 'Kumar D', 'Saha KD']","['Cancer and Cell Biology Division, CSIR Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja, S.C.Mullick Road, Jadavpur, Kolkata-700032, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120912,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '108886-04-0 (corchorusin D)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Corchorus/chemistry', 'Glycosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['000341469 [pii]', '10.1159/000341469 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2012;30(4):915-26. doi: 10.1159/000341469.

We decided to evaluate the roles of EKLF and Fli1 in the pathogenesis of this syndrome and of another ribosomopathy, Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Fli1 and EKLF mRNA levels were examined in mononuclear blood and bone marrow cells from patients with 5q- syndrome, low-risk MDS patients with normal chromosome 5, DBA patients, and healthy controls. In 5q- syndrome, high Fli1 mRNA levels in the blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were found. In DBA, Fli1 expression did not differ from the controls. EKLF mRNA level was significantly decreased in the blood and bone marrow of 5q- syndrome and in all DBA patients. We propose that the elevated Fli1 in 5q- syndrome protects megakaryocytic cells from ribosomal stress contrary to erythroid cells and contributes to effective though dysplastic megakaryopoiesis.","['Neuwirtova, Radana', 'Fuchs, Ota', 'Holicka, Monika', 'Vostry, Martin', 'Kostecka, Arnost', 'Hajkova, Hana', 'Jonasova, Anna', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Cmejla, Radek', 'Pospisilova, Dagmar', 'Belickova, Monika', 'Siskova, Magda', 'Hochova, Ivana', 'Vondrakova, Jana', 'Sponerova, Dana', 'Kadlckova, Eva', 'Novakova, Ludmila', 'Brezinova, Jana', 'Michalova, Kyra']","['Neuwirtova R', 'Fuchs O', 'Holicka M', 'Vostry M', 'Kostecka A', 'Hajkova H', 'Jonasova A', 'Cermak J', 'Cmejla R', 'Pospisilova D', 'Belickova M', 'Siskova M', 'Hochova I', 'Vondrakova J', 'Sponerova D', 'Kadlckova E', 'Novakova L', 'Brezinova J', 'Michalova K']","['1st Department of Medicine, Department of Hematology, General University Hospital, U Nemocnice 2, Prague 2, 128 00, Czech Republic. neuwirtova.radana@vfn.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', 'Chromosome 5q Deletion Syndrome']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/*genetics/metabolism', 'Anemia, Macrocytic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/blood', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomal Proteins/physiology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1568-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Jan;92(1):11-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1568-1.

Both the ease of oral administration over intramuscular injections and more potent anti-inflammatory effects in vitro made auranofin seem like an excellent substitute for the traditional injectable gold compounds. Despite efficacy in the treatment of both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, currently, auranofin is seldom used as a treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis as more novel anti-rheumatic medications have become available. Despite the decline in its clinical applications, research on auranofin has continued as it shows promise in the treatment of several different diseases. In recent years, advances in technology have allowed researchers to use molecular techniques to identify novel mechanisms of action of auranofin. Additionally, researchers are discovering potential new applications of auranofin. Dual inhibition of inflammatory pathways and thiol redox enzymes by auranofin makes it a new candidate for cancer therapy and treating microbial infections. This review will summarize recently obtained data on the mechanisms of action of auranofin, and potential new applications of auranofin in the treatment of various diseases, including several types of leukaemia, carcinomas, and parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections.","['Madeira, J M', 'Gibson, D L', 'Kean, W F', 'Klegeris, A']","['Madeira JM', 'Gibson DL', 'Kean WF', 'Klegeris A']","['Department of Biology, Irving K.

RECENT FINDINGS: The identification of factors influencing the onset of infections in high-risk patients is becoming one of the most important strategies to identify those patients who would really benefit from prophylactic and timely treatment. During the past few years several studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of risk factors that may influence both the onset and the outcome of infections. The role of some of them is well defined (i.e. neutropenia, central venous catheters), whereas other factors are now emerging as new possible causative factors (i.e. iron overload, hospitalization). SUMMARY: Many factors have to be considered when evaluating the infectious risk in hematological patients. In current clinical practice the good knowledge of these factors may favor a better management of infectious risk, with a reduction of mortality rate.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Caira, Morena']","['Pagano L', 'Caira M']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QCO.0b013e328358b000 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2012 Dec;25(6):612-8. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328358b000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aided by the discovery of effective inhibitors such as Y27632, their roles in cancer have been extensively explored with particular attention focused on motility, invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have revealed a surprisingly diverse range of functions of ROCK. These insights could change the way ROCK inhibitors might be used in cancer therapy to include the targeting of stromal rather than tumour cells, the concomitant blocking of ROCK and proteasome activity in K-Ras-driven lung cancers and the combination of ROCK with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for treating haematological malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukaemia. Despite initial optimism for therapeutic efficacy of ROCK inhibition for cancer treatment, no compounds have progressed into standard therapy so far. However, by carefully defining the key cancer types and expanding the appreciation of ROCK's role in cancer beyond being a cell-autonomous promoter of tumour cell invasion and metastasis, the early promise of ROCK inhibitors for cancer therapy might still be realized.","['Rath, Nicola', 'Olson, Michael F']","['Rath N', 'Olson MF']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120911,England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/01/31 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['embor2012127 [pii]', '10.1038/embor.2012.127 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2012 Oct;13(10):900-8. doi: 10.1038/embor.2012.127.

Several miRNAs are differentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues and play important roles in normal differentiation, but, when aberrantly regulated, contribute to the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cells. Recently, we reported that a small subset of miRNAs is differentially expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) blasts and is modulated by treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). In particular, PML/RARalpha-positive blasts from APL patients display lower levels of miRNA let-7c, a member of the let-7 family, than normal promyelocytes and its expression increases after ATRA treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of let-7c in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We found that ectopic expression of let-7c promotes granulocytic differentiation of AML cell lines and primary blasts. Moreover, we identified PBX2, a well-known homeodomain protein whose aberrant expression enhances HoxA9-dependent leukemogenesis, as a novel let-7c target that may contribute to the AML phenotype. Together, these studies raise the possibility that perturbation of the let-7c-PBX2 pathway may have a therapeutic value in AML.","['Pelosi, A', 'Careccia, S', 'Lulli, V', 'Romania, P', 'Marziali, G', 'Testa, U', 'Lavorgna, S', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Petti, M C', 'Calabretta, B', 'Levrero, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Rizzo, M G']","['Pelosi A', 'Careccia S', 'Lulli V', 'Romania P', 'Marziali G', 'Testa U', 'Lavorgna S', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Petti MC', 'Calabretta B', 'Levrero M', 'Piaggio G', 'Rizzo MG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Laboratory of Molecular Oncogenesis, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120910,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PBX2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012398 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.398 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Aug 1;32(31):3648-54. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.398.

In the present study, we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) protein was tumor-selectively expressed in human colorectal malignancies and knockdown of MCT2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence without additional cellular stress in colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, blocked MCT2 knockdown-induced growth arrest and cellular senescence, indicating a pivotal role of ROS in this pathway. Dramatic induction of mitochondrial superoxide generation and decrease in ATP production was observed, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is the major mechanism underlying MCT2 knockdown-induced ROS generation. Senescence-associated DNA damage was also evident from the increase in promyelocytic leukemia bodies, gammaH2AX foci, and SAHF. Conversely, overexpression of MCT2 prevented doxorubicin-induced ROS accumulation (P = 0.0002) and cell growth inhibition (P = 0.001). MCT2 knockdown suppressed KRAS mutant colorectal tumor growth in vivo. In addition, MCT2 knockdown and cytostatic drug combination further enhanced the antitumor effect.

However, the exact molecular mechanism of inter-subunit interactions required for correct expression and function of the FcvarepsilonRI complex remains to be identified. A recent study suggested that polar aspartate at position 194 within the transmembrane domain of the alpha subunit could interact by hydrogen bonding with polar threonine at position 22 in the transmembrane domains of the gamma subunits. To verify this, we used previously isolated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 variant cells deficient in the expression of the FcvarepsilonRI-gamma subunit (FcR-gamma), and transfected them with DNA vectors coding for FcR-gamma of the wild-type or mutants in which T22 was substituted for nonpolar alanine (T22A mutant) or polar serine (T22S mutant). Analysis of the transfectants showed that both T22A and T22S mutants were capable to restore surface expression of the FcvarepsilonRI similar to wild-type FcR-gamma. Furthermore, cells transfected with wild-type, T22A or T22S FcR-gamma showed comparably enhanced FcvarepsilonRI-mediated degranulation.

Evidence from 2013 cases and 2903 controls.,14-21,10.1016/j.gene.2012.08.042 [doi] S0378-1119(12)01043-8 [pii],"Previous studies indicated that cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) MspI polymorphism might be a possible risk factor for several malignancies. Increasing investigations have been conducted on the association of CYP1A1 MspI polymorphisms with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the results were controversial. The goal of the present study was to address this controversy by pooling and analyzing the published data. Therefore, quantitative meta-analyses evaluating the association of CYP1A1 MspI variation with ALL were performed and subgroup analyses on ethnicity, age groups and source of controls were further carried out. After a rigorous search in the Medline, EMBASE, OVID, ScienceDirect, and CNKI databases, all eligible studies for the period up to May 2012 were identified and screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consequently, a total of fourteen case-control studies including 2013 cases and 2903 controls were selected for analysis. The overall data indicated a significant association of CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism with ALL risk (CC+TC vs TT: OR=1.33; 95%CI=1.05-1.69). In a subgroup analysis according to ethnicity, no associations were shown among Asians, Caucasians and Mixed ethnicity subgroups. In the subgroup analysis regarding age groups, increased risk was observed in the childhood ALL subgroup (C vs T: OR=1.23; 95%CI=1.04-1.45; CC+TC vs TT: OR=1.31; 95%CI=1.08-1.59). In the subgroup analysis stratified by source of controls, significant associations were observed in the population-based subgroup (CC+TC vs TT: OR=1.33; 95%CI=1.03-1.71). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism might be a risk factor for ALL, particularly childhood ALL. Future well-designed high quality investigations with large sample sizes are required to elucidate the gene polymorphism-ALL relationship and gene-environment interactions.","['Zhuo, Wenlei', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Qiu, Zhiqun', 'Zhu, Bo', 'Chen, Zhengtang']","['Zhuo W', 'Zhang L', 'Qiu Z', 'Zhu B', 'Chen Z']","['Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. zhuowenlei@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20120903,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HpaII)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Asians/genetics', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease HpaII/metabolism', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ethnology/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Whites/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/12 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(12)01043-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2012.08.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2012 Nov 15;510(1):14-21. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2012.08.042.

CIL-102 attenuated K562 cell invasion with decreased MMP-2/MMP-9 protein expression and mRNA levels. Moreover, CIL-102 reduced luciferase activity of MMP-2/MMP-9 promoter constructs and MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA stability. CIL-102 treatment induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation but reduced the phospho-ERK level. Transfection of constitutively active MEK1 restored MMP-2 and MMP-9 promoter activity in CIL-102-treated cells, while suppression of p38 MAPK/JNK activation abolished CIL-102-induced MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA decay. CIL-102-induced p38 MAPK/JNK activation led to protein phosphatase 2A-mediated tristetraprolin (TTP) down-regulation. The reduction in TTP-KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) complexes formation promoted KSRP-mediated MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA decay in CIL-102-treated K562 cells. Moreover, CIL-102 reduced invasion and MMP-2/MMP-9 expression in breast and liver cancer cells.

RESULT(S): Endometrial tissues could be grown on amniotic membrane matrix for 3 days with morphometric parameters similar to those in the in vivo pseudopregnant control. The cultured tissues responded to the surrounding steroid environment. Morphometric assessment indicated that medium containing 63.5 nmol/L P and 0.9 nmol/L E(2) provided the best support. The condition allowed attachment of approximately 60% of the cocultured blastocysts. A small percentage of the attached blastocyst started to penetrate the luminal epithelium within 28 hours. The attachment rate was significantly reduced with prior treatment of the cultured endometrium with anti-leukemia inhibitory factor antibody.

Additionally, an interview regarding management practices with cooperating herd managers identified farm-level variables thought to be associated with prevalence of BLV. Twenty-three risk factors (P </= 0.1) were identified on one-way ANOVA or simple linear regression. Multivariate analysis identified several management practices whose predictive value for increased prevalence of BLV may relate to transmission among herd mates, e.g. reuse of hypodermic needles, lack of fly control, gouge dehorning and increased use of injections in dry cows. Additionally, exclusive breeding of heifers with artificial insemination was associated with decreased BLV prevalence, as compared with at least some use of natural service by a bull. Although intervention studies are needed before causal relationships can be concluded, and unaccounted variables related to transmission exist among dairy herds, these findings suggest management practices that may help dairy producers reduce the transmission of BLV within their herds.","['Erskine, Ronald J', 'Bartlett, Paul C', 'Byrem, Todd M', 'Render, Chelsea L', 'Febvay, Catherine', 'Houseman, Jessica T']","['Erskine RJ', 'Bartlett PC', 'Byrem TM', 'Render CL', 'Febvay C', 'Houseman JT']","['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,England,J Dairy Res,The Journal of dairy research,2985125R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Breeding', 'Cattle', 'Dairying/methods', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*transmission/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Insemination, Artificial/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022029912000520 [pii]', '10.1017/S0022029912000520 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Res. 2012 Nov;79(4):445-50. doi: 10.1017/S0022029912000520.

The finding of leukemia stem cells and subsequently breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) further supports the concept. The importance of these findings lends itself to the selfrenewal properties of stem cells in addition to the survival characteristics of stem cells, mechanisms that will have to be overcome when creating treatment modalities. In particular, research has shown that stem cells and a specific type of stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), have special drug effluxing properties and some interactions with particular cells of the immune system that may serve major roles in immunosuppresion and overall tumor cell survival. Furthermore, the recent discovery of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has laid out a possible mechanism for tumor cells to lose particular phenotypic epithelial cell markers and gain phenotypic mesenchymal cell markers. This process is implicated in metastasis in addition to overall tumor survival and evasion of the immune system. This review examines the current understanding of how tumor cells evade the immune system, but will first explore stem cells, cancer stem cells, normal immune interaction with tumor cells, and EMT.","['Nahas, George R', 'Patel, Shyam A', 'Bliss, Sarah A', 'Rameshwar, Pranela']","['Nahas GR', 'Patel SA', 'Bliss SA', 'Rameshwar P']","['UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine, Camden, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",2012/09/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-20120903-41 [pii]', '10.2174/092986712804485863 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2012;19(35):6036-49. doi: 10.2174/092986712804485863.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic responses are known to vary between patients with chemosensitive CLL and may relate to differences in p53-pathway activity. We hypothesized that the magnitude or type of p53-pathway protein expression is heterogeneous in patients with chemosensitive disease and could associate with white cell responses. In this pilot study, changes in p53 and its transcriptional targets, p21/waf1 and MDM2 were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry in CLL cells from 10 patients immediately prior to the start of chemotherapy, and after culture for 24 hours (h) with fludarabine (n=7) or chlorambucil (n=3). The in vitro response was also compared to that in vivo in circulating cells pre-treatment, and at 24h and 96h of chemotherapy. Disease responses were evident in all patients after the first treatment-cycle. Significant p53 induction was observed in CLL cells treated in vitro and in vivo. Greater heterogeneity in the expression-intensity was observed in vivo (sigma2=45.15) than in vitro (sigma2=1.33) and the results failed to correlate (r(2)=0.18, p=0.22). p21/waf1 and MDM2 expression-profiles were also dissimilar in vitro and in vivo. Higher in vivo (but not in vitro) responses associated with changes in white cell count (p=0.026). Thus, heterogeneity of p53-pathway activity exists in chemosensitive CLL; in unselected patients, in vivo changes do not correlate with those in vitro, but may associate with post-treatment white cell responses.","['Groves, Michael J', 'Maccallum, Stephanie F', 'Boylan, Michael T', 'Haydock, Sally', 'Cunningham, Joan', 'Gelly, Keith', 'Gowans, Duncan', 'Kerr, Ron', 'Coates, Philip J', 'Tauro, Sudhir']","['Groves MJ', 'Maccallum SF', 'Boylan MT', 'Haydock S', 'Cunningham J', 'Gelly K', 'Gowans D', 'Kerr R', 'Coates PJ', 'Tauro S']","['1.

However, there has been less work for prospective cohort studies, involving the survival time. Recently, Gui et al. (2011) proposed a novel method, called Surv-MDR, for detecting gene-gene interactions associated with survival time. Surv-MDR is an extension of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method to the survival phenotype by using the log-rank test for defining a binary attribute. However, the Surv-MDR method has some drawbacks in the sense that it needs more intensive computations and does not allow for a covariate adjustment. In this article, we propose a new approach, called Cox-MDR, which is an extension of the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) to the survival phenotype by using a martingale residual as a score to classify multi-level genotypes as high- and low-risk groups. The advantages of Cox-MDR over Surv-MDR are to allow for the effects of discrete and quantitative covariates in the frame of Cox regression model and to require less computation than Surv-MDR. RESULTS: Through simulation studies, we compared the power of Cox-MDR with those of Surv-MDR and Cox regression model for various heritability and minor allele frequency combinations without and with adjusting for covariate. We found that Cox-MDR and Cox regression model perform better than Surv-MDR for low minor allele frequency of 0.2, but Surv-MDR has high power for minor allele frequency of 0.4. However, when the effect of covariate is adjusted for, Cox-MDR and Cox regression model perform much better than Surv-MDR. We also compared the performance of Cox-MDR and Surv-MDR for a real data of leukemia patients to detect the gene-gene interactions with the survival time.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib was administered orally every 12 hours for consecutive 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetics (day 1 and steady-state) and pharmacodynamics were conducted during cycle 1. RESULTS: Of 65 patients enrolled, 60 were eligible. In the solid tumor cohort (n = 49), 4 of 6 patients experienced a DLT [hypertension, pain, rash/urticaria, thrombocytopenia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] at the starting dose (150 mg/m(2)/dose) which resulted in de-escalation to 105 mg/m(2)/dose. After eligibility criteria modification and dose re-escalation, the MTD was 200 mg/m(2)/dose for solid tumors and 150 mg/m(2)/dose for leukemias. Sorafenib exposure was highly variable between patients but was within the ranges reported in adults. The apparent sorafenib clearance increased with patient age. Diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and increased ALT/AST were the most common sorafenib-related toxicities. Stable disease for 4 or more cycles was observed in 14 solid tumor patients, and 2 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) experienced a decrease in bone marrow blasts to less than 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose of sorafenib administered every 12 hours continuously for children with solid tumors is 200 mg/m(2)/dose and 150 mg/m(2)/dose for children with leukemias. Sorafenib toxicities and distribution in children are similar to adults. The activity of sorafenib in children with AML and FLT3ITD is currently being evaluated, and a phase II study for select solid tumors is ongoing.","['Widemann, Brigitte C', 'Kim, Aerang', 'Fox, Elizabeth', 'Baruchel, Sylvain', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Ingle, Ashish M', 'Glade Bender, Julia', 'Burke, Michael', 'Weigel, Brenda', 'Stempak, Diana', 'Balis, Frank M', 'Blaney, Susan M']","['Widemann BC', 'Kim A', 'Fox E', 'Baruchel S', 'Adamson PC', 'Ingle AM', 'Glade Bender J', 'Burke M', 'Weigel B', 'Stempak D', 'Balis FM', 'Blaney SM']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. widemanb@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120907,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-3284 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3284 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Nov 1;18(21):6011-22. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3284.

Currently available Notch inhibitors block gamma-secretase, which is necessary for Notch processing. However, Notch is first cleaved by alpha-secretase outside the plasma membrane, via a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-10 and -17. In this work, we used a potent alpha-secretase inhibitor (ASI) to test inhibition of glioblastoma growth and inhibition of Notch and of both novel and known Notch targets. Featured in this study are luciferase reporter assays and immunoblot, microarray analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative real-time PCR, cell number assay, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, plasmid rescue, orthotopic xenograft model, and local delivery of treatment with convection-enhanced delivery using nanoparticles, as well as survival, MRI, and ex vivo luciferase assay. A CBF1-luciferase reporter assay as well as an immunoblot of endogenous Notch revealed Notch inhibition by the ASI. Microarray analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, and ChIP of ASI and gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment of GBM cells identified known Notch pathway targets, as well as novel Notch targets, including YKL-40 and leukemia inhibitory factor. Finally, we found that local nanoparticle delivery of ASIs but not GSIs increased survival time significantly in a GBM stem cell xenograft treatment model, and ASI treatment resulted in decreased tumor size and Notch activity. This work indicates alpha-secretase as an alternative to gamma-secretase for inhibition of Notch in GBM and possibly other cancers as well, and it identifies novel Notch targets with biologic relevance and potential as biomarkers.","['Floyd, Desiree H', 'Kefas, Benjamin', 'Seleverstov, Oleksandr', 'Mykhaylyk, Olga', 'Dominguez, Charli', 'Comeau, Laurey', 'Plank, Christian', 'Purow, Benjamin']","['Floyd DH', 'Kefas B', 'Seleverstov O', 'Mykhaylyk O', 'Dominguez C', 'Comeau L', 'Plank C', 'Purow B']","['Division of Neuro-Oncology, Neurology Department, University of Virginia Health System, Old Medical School-Room 4814, 21 Hospital Drive, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120907,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (INCB3619)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Magnetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nanoparticles', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spiro Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['nos157 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/nos157 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2012 Oct;14(10):1215-26. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nos157.

Notably, we found that NIS enhanced cell migration and invasion without ion transport being involved. These functions were mediated by NIS binding to leukemia-associated RhoA guanine exchange factor, a Rho guanine exchange factor that activates the small GTPase RhoA. Sequestering NIS in intracellular organelles or impairing its targeting to the cell surface (as observed in many cancers) led to a further increase in cell motility and invasiveness.

METHODS: We used a new flow cytometric immunobead assay for BCR-ABL fusion protein detection in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples from 38 adult pB-ALL patients and the results were compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of BCR-ABL transcript. RESULTS: The fusion protein was detected in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from seven of the 38 (18%) patients, and results for both the p190 and p210 were confirmed by PCR. One case, which was positive by cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), was negative by PCR but positive by flow cytometry.

Cytogenetic and FISH analysis.,79-87,10.1002/hon.2025 [doi],"In this study, we described cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis performed in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients with structural alterations. Results were correlated with clinical characteristics. A total of 38 CLL patients: 16 cases with complex and 22 with simple karyotypes were studied. For comparison of clinical parameters, a control group of 78 CLL patients with normal karyotype and without FISH genomic alterations were also evaluated. We found 38 structural abnormalities not previously described in the literature, 28 (74%) of them were translocations. In cases with complex karyotypes, chromosomes 6, 8 and 13 were the most frequently involved in new alterations (nine each), followed by chromosomes 12, 14 and 15 (six each). Chromosome 8p was particularly involved in losses, being 8p21-pter the commonest region of overlap. Cases with simple karyotypes, showed del(6q) as the most frequent alteration (39%). Del(9)(q11) was recurrent in our series. Analysis of clinical parameters showed significant differences in white blood count (p = 0.005) and platelet count (p = 0.015) between patients with structural alterations and the control group. In addition, patients with structural alterations had a significantly shorter time to first treatment (TFT) (29 months) than the control group (69 months) (p = 0.037). Cases with complex karyotypes had a lower proportion of patients in Rai 0 clinical stage (15.4% vs 75%) (p = 0.005) and higher beta2 microglobulin levels (3.3 vs 2.5 microg/mL) (p = 0.037) than those with simple karyotypes. Furthermore, a shorter TFT (13 months) and overall survival (56 months) in the complex karyotypes group compared with controls (69 and 144 months, respectively) (p = 0.015 and p = 0.005, respectively) were also found. Our results support the importance of cytogenetic analysis for clinical outcome in CLL and suggest that the diversity of genomic alterations is much greater than previously appreciated.","['Travella, Ana', 'Ripolles, Lorena', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Rodriguez, Andrea', 'Bezares, Raimundo F', 'Caballin, Maria R', 'Slavutsky, Irma']","['Travella A', 'Ripolles L', 'Aventin A', 'Rodriguez A', 'Bezares RF', 'Caballin MR', 'Slavutsky I']","['Laboratorio de Genetica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX) CONICET- Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2025 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jun;31(2):79-87. doi: 10.1002/hon.2025.

In vitro, this led to high levels of asparagine and conferred asparaginase resistance to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MSCs or other cells in BM indeed produce such significant amounts of asparagine in vivo as to result in clinical asparaginase resistance. PROCEDURE: Twenty-six patients with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled. All children received induction chemotherapy according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL-10 protocol. Asparaginase was administered from days 12-33. Asparaginase, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine, and glutamic acid levels were measured in BM and blood at diagnosis, days 15, 33, and 79. RESULTS: Median asparaginase trough levels were not significantly different at days 15 and 33. Only at diagnosis, asparagine level was significantly higher in BM than in blood (P = 0.001). Asparagine levels were all below the lower limit of quantification in BM and blood at days 15 and 33. However, aspartic acid level in BM was significantly higher than in blood (P < 0.001) at diagnosis, and also at days 15, 33, and 79. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate higher aspartic acid levels in BM compared to blood; however, no increased asparagine levels were seen during induction therapy containing asparaginase in BM when compared to blood. Therefore, increased asparagine synthesis by MSCs is of relevance for resistance to asparaginase of leukemic cells in vitro, but it is questionable whether this leads to asparaginase resistance in childhood ALL patients.","['Tong, Wing H', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Hop, Wim C J', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky, Claudia', 'Boos, Joachim', 'van der Sluis, Inge M']","['Tong WH', 'Pieters R', 'Hop WC', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky C', 'Boos J', 'van der Sluis IM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24292 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Feb;60(2):258-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24292.

However, involvement of the Hh-signaling system in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment during the development of myeloid neoplasms is unknown. In this study, we assessed the expression of Hh-related genes in primary human CD34(+) cells, CD34(+) blastic cells and BM stromal cells. Both Indian Hh (Ihh) and its signal transducer, smoothened (SMO), were expressed in CD34(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-derived cells. However, Ihh expression was relatively low in BM stromal cells. Remarkably, expression of the intrinsic Hh-signaling inhibitor, human Hh-interacting protein (HHIP) in AML/MDS-derived stromal cells was markedly lower than in healthy donor-derived stromal cells. Moreover, HHIP expression levels in BM stromal cells highly correlated with their supporting activity for SMO(+) leukemic cells. Knockdown of HHIP gene in stromal cells increased their supporting activity although control cells marginally supported SMO(+) leukemic cell proliferation. The demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine rescued HHIP expression via demethylation of HHIP gene and reduced the leukemic cell-supporting activity of AML/MDS-derived stromal cells. This indicates that suppression of stromal HHIP could be associated with the proliferation of AML/MDS cells.","['Kobune, M', 'Iyama, S', 'Kikuchi, S', 'Horiguchi, H', 'Sato, T', 'Murase, K', 'Kawano, Y', 'Takada, K', 'Ono, K', 'Kamihara, Y', 'Hayashi, T', 'Miyanishi, K', 'Sato, Y', 'Takimoto, R', 'Kato, J']","['Kobune M', 'Iyama S', 'Kikuchi S', 'Horiguchi H', 'Sato T', 'Murase K', 'Kawano Y', 'Takada K', 'Ono K', 'Kamihara Y', 'Hayashi T', 'Miyanishi K', 'Sato Y', 'Takimoto R', 'Kato J']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120907,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,2012/09/11 06:00,2012/09/11 06:01,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201236 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2012.36 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2012 Sep 7;2:e87. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2012.36.,PMC3461706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this, we carried out a cell viability assay by MTT, an apoptosis/necrosis assay through the annexin/propidium iodide label, cell cycle by flow cytometry, assessed changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential using DiOC6(3), cytoplasmic calcium analysis by Fluo-3-AM, and a caspase-9 and caspase-12 activity assay.

The compound induced an increase in cytoplasmic calcium on both cell lines. However, the compound could only induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization on K562 cells. Our data show that LQB 118 may have potential therapeutic value for leukemia, being able to overcome multiple resistance mechanisms.","['de Sa Bacelar, Thiago', 'da Silva, Alcides J', 'Costa, Paulo R R', 'Rumjanek, Vivian M']","['de Sa Bacelar T', 'da Silva AJ', 'Costa PR', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Medical Biochemistry Institute, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (LQB 118)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Pterocarpans)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 12)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 12/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Pterocarpans/*pharmacology']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283592da8 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2013 Jan;24(1):73-83. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283592da8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ocular side effects are commonly reported with the use of imatinib mesylate, such as periorbital edema and epiphora. More serious ocular side effects, such as optic disc edema, are rarely reported. CASE REPORT: This case is of a patient who presented with monocular painless loss of vision in the left eye from a previously documented 20/20 to 20/70 shortly after starting treatment with imatinib mesylate. RESULTS: Every aspect of the ocular presentation and clinical history were addressed to unveil the cause of the disc edema. After ruling out all other causes, the patient was later diagnosed with unilateral optic disc edema as a related side effect of the toxicity from imatinib mesylate. CONCLUSIONS: The properties of imatinib mesylate and the possible etiology of secondary optic disc edema are discussed.

Therefore, alternative approaches are needed. Signals from the microenvironment are increasingly recognized as drivers of disease progression in hematologic and solid cancers. Consequently, there is growing interest in targeting the tumor-microenvironment cross-talk. This review highlights recent therapeutic advances in targeting the microenvironment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). RECENT FINDINGS: CLL is the poster child for microenvironment-dependent malignancies, because the clonal CLL B cells are highly dependent on external signals for maintenance and expansion. These pathways recapitulate those responsible for normal B-cell expansion in germinal centers. The most prominent, conserved mechanism is B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which promotes CLL cell survival and expansion in lymphatic tissue areas designated proliferation centers. BCR signaling now can be targeted by new targeted kinase inhibitors. SUMMARY: Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL therapy. This development exemplifies that the microenvironment has become a lively successful area of translational research.","['Burger, Jan A']",['Burger JA'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77230-1402, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283589950 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2012 Nov;24(6):643-9. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283589950.,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), contribute to skeletal remodeling and repair. They also support haematopoiesis constructing important elements of haematopoietic niche. In the present study, the effects of a range of benzene concentrations along with those of its reactive metabolites, p-benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (HQ) on the viability of MSCs, apoptosis induction and caspase3/7 activity in these cells were analyzed. Our findings revealed that low concentrations of these chemicals (10muM of benzene, 5muM of either of BQ or HQ) significantly increase the number of chemically treated cells. Moreover, applied BQ/HQ concentrations were shown to be able to considerably inhibit caspase3/7 activity. While in benzene exposure experiments, the lowest concentration triggered the greatest increase in caspase3/7 activity during the initial hours of exposure. On the other hand, MSCs exposure to higher concentrations of benzene (100muM) and its metabolites, BQ/HQ (10muM and 50muM), can induce cell death after 24h of exposure mainly through apoptotic pathways. In addition, changes in the expression of six mRNAs due to being subjected to 10muM of BQ or HQ and 50muM of benzene were assessed. The genes under investigation were RUNX2, WNT5A, DKK1, JAG1, KITLG and CXCL12 which are expressed by MSCs playing roles in adipo-osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and the regulation of haematopoiesis. The analysis exhibited a great augmentation in RUNX2 expression associated with DKK1 and KITLG up-regulation. The results also indicated that treatment of cells with all three chemicals gives rise to down-regulation of JAG1 and treatment with both HQ and BQ triggers WNT5A over-expression. With regard to CXCL12, treatment with BQ caused slight up-regulation and treatment with HQ led to down-regulation. The alterations observed in the expression profile of genes could affect/modify the process of differentiation of MSCs into osteoblast. Other expected outcomes involve augmented canonical Wnt signaling activity in exposed cells with RUNX2 overexpression as the indicator which is probably forced to decrease to the normal level via DKK1 and WNT5A up-regulation. RUNX2 overexpression in MSCs can also be indicative of the RUNX2 up-regulation in myeloid progenitors thereby its involvement in AML development due to benzene exposure. Observed changes in the expression of WNT5A, DKK1, KITLG, CXCL12 and JAG1 can lead to the disturbance of HSC niche resulting in haematopoietic failure and leukemia development. It is obvious that increased viability together with caspase3/7 inhibition could aggravate the adverse effects of exposure to these chemicals.","['Zolghadr, Fatemeh', 'Sadeghizadeh, Majid', 'Amirizadeh, Naser', 'Hosseinkhani, Saman', 'Nazem, Shima']","['Zolghadr F', 'Sadeghizadeh M', 'Amirizadeh N', 'Hosseinkhani S', 'Nazem S']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, P.O.

Recently, age >/= 13 years at diagnosis has been identified as a very high-risk feature for chemotherapy treated pediatric patients with B-ALL. Whether age at time of transplantation is associated with poor outcomes in adolescents and young adults (AYA) is unknown. We hypothesized that AYA receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) would have greater relapse and inferior survival compared with children age <13 years. We reviewed the outcomes in 136 consecutive patients (age 0-30 years) with B-ALL who underwent myeloablative allo-HCT at our institution, including 79 children age <13 years (58%) and 57 AYA age 13-30 years (42%). Overall survival at 5 years was significantly lower in the AYA group (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.95; P = .03). In addition, the AYA patients had a greater risk of transplantation-related mortality at 1 year (hazard ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.01-4.90; P = .05), but no difference in relapse (relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.41-1.76; P = .66). Based on this analysis, AYA patients undergoing allo-HCT for B-ALL have significantly inferior survival and greater transplantation-related mortality compared with children age <13 years, but no difference in relapse, suggesting that allo-HCT may overcome relapse in AYA. Further improvements in peritransplantation care are needed to limit complications in AYA patients.","['Burke, Michael J', 'Gossai, Nathan', 'Wagner, John E', 'Smith, Angela R', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Cao, Qing', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Stefanski, Heather S', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Verneris, Michael R']","['Burke MJ', 'Gossai N', 'Wagner JE', 'Smith AR', 'Bachanova V', 'Cao Q', 'MacMillan ML', 'Stefanski HS', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Verneris MR']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Minnesota, Amplatz Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. burke283@umn.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120906,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00354-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jan;19(1):138-42. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.08.020.

However, the efficacy of these regimens before this procedure has not been investigated in a randomised trial. In this prospective, open-label randomised phase 3 trial we compared a reduced-intensity fludarabine-based conditioning regimen with a standard regimen in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission. METHODS: Patients were aged 18-60 years and had intermediate-risk or high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia (defined by cytogenetics) in first complete remission; an available HLA-matched sibling donor or an unrelated donor with at least nine of ten HLA alleles; and adequate renal, cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological function. Between Nov 15, 2004, and Dec 31, 2009, patients were randomly assigned (1:1, by a computer-based minimisation procedure that balanced patients for age, cytogenetic risk, induction therapy, and donor type) to receive either reduced-intensity conditioning of four doses of 2 Gy of total-body irradiation and 150 mg/m(2) fludarabine or standard conditioning of six doses of 2 Gy of total-body irradiation and 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. All patients were given ciclosporin and methotrexate as prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. Neither investigators nor patients were blinded to study treatment. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of non-relapse mortality, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00150878. FINDINGS: The trial was stopped early on Dec 31, 2009, because of slow accrual of patients. 99 patients were randomly assigned to receive reduced-intensity conditioning and 96 to receive standard conditioning. The incidence of non-relapse mortality did not differ between the reduced-intensity and standard conditioning groups (cumulative incidence at 3 years 13% [95% CI 6-21] vs 18% [10-26]; HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.30-1.31]). Relapse incidence (cumulative incidence 3 years 28% [95% CI 19-38] vs 26% [17-36]; HR 1.10 [95% CI 0.63-1.90]), disease-free survival (3 year disease-free survival 58% [95% CI 49-70] vs 56% [46-67]; HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.55-1.32]), and overall survival (3 year overall survival 61% [95% CI 50-74] vs 58% [47-70]; HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.48-1.25]) did not differ significantly between groups. Grade 3-4 of oral mucositis was less common in the reduced-intensity group than in the standard conditioning group (50 patients in the reduced-intensity conditioning group vs 73 patients in the standard conditioning group); the frequency of other side-effects such as graft-versus-host disease and increased concentrations of bilirubin and creatinine did not differ significantly between groups. INTERPRETATION: Reduced-intensity conditioning results in a similar incidence of non-relapse mortality and reduced toxic effects compared with standard conditioning without affecting survival outcomes, and thus could be preferentially used in patients younger than 60 years with acute myeloid leukaemia transplanted in first complete remission.","['Bornhauser, Martin', 'Kienast, Joachim', 'Trenschel, Rudolf', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Baurmann, Herrad', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Einsele, Herrmann', 'Kiehl, Michael G', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Buchholz, Stefanie', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Stelljes, Matthias']","['Bornhauser M', 'Kienast J', 'Trenschel R', 'Burchert A', 'Hegenbart U', 'Stadler M', 'Baurmann H', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Holler E', 'Kroger N', 'Schmid C', 'Einsele H', 'Kiehl MG', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Buchholz S', 'Dreger P', 'Neubauer A', 'Berdel WE', 'Ehninger G', 'Beelen DW', 'Schetelig J', 'Stelljes M']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Dresden, Germany. martin.bornhaeuser@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of MCPyV to B-CLL and to investigate the occurrence of MCPyV infection in relationship to the natural history of B-CLL. STUDY DESIGN: Samples of primary B-CLL peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from two distinct University Hospitals of Italy from January 2010. For one B-CLL patient, it was possible to retrospectively examine the blood sample at diagnosis of B-CLL (March 2004) and several pathological tissues of cutaneous tumors occurring during the course of the disease. RESULTS: Only one out of 50 B-CLL blood samples examined was positive for MCPyV DNA. Retrospective analysis revealed that MCPyV DNA was absent in peripheral blood sample at diagnosis, becoming present only in advanced disease stages also in tonsil tissue as well as in a biopsy of differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The association with MCPyV seems to represent a rare and late event during the natural history of B-CLL.","['Comar, Manola', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Maestri, Iva', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Soffritti, Olga', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Comar M', 'Cuneo A', 'Maestri I', 'Melloni E', 'Pozzato G', 'Soffritti O', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Merkel cell polyomavirus/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Palatine Tonsil/virology', 'Polyomavirus Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Skin/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/*epidemiology']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1386-6532(12)00315-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2012.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2012 Dec;55(4):367-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2012.08.011.

The Notch proteins are single-pass receptors that are activated upon interaction with the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. Association of ligand-receptor leads to proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-corepressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of a transcriptional complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes. The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell fate decision, tissue patterning, morphogenesis, and is hence regarded as a developmental pathway. However, if this pathway goes awry, it contributes to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. There is mounting evidence that this pathway is dysregulated in a variety of malignancies, and can behave as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending upon cell context. This chapter highlights the current evidence for aberration of the Notch signaling pathway in a wide range of tumors from hematological cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, through to lung, skin, breast, pancreas, colon, prostate, ovarian, brain, and liver tumors. It proposes that the Notch signaling pathway may represent novel target for cancer therapeutic intervention.","['Shao, Hongwei', 'Huang, Qinghua', 'Liu, Zhao-Jun']","['Shao H', 'Huang Q', 'Liu ZJ']","['Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Pharmacol,"Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",9015397,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-397927-8.00007-5 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-397927-8.00007-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Pharmacol. 2012;65:191-234. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-397927-8.00007-5.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The automated digital algorithm was built by a series of programmatic queries applied to an institutional electronic medical record database. The automated digital algorithm was derived from secondary analysis of an observational cohort study of 1447 patients admitted to the intensive care unit from January 1 through December 31, 2006, and validated in an independent cohort of 240 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the automated digital algorithm and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were compared with comprehensive medical record review (reference standard) for the Charlson comorbidities. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, the automated digital algorithm achieved a median sensitivity of 100% (range, 99%-100%) and a median specificity of 99.7% (range, 99%-100%). In the validation cohort, the sensitivity of the automated digital algorithm ranged from 91% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The sensitivity of the ICD-9 codes ranged from 8% for dementia to 100% for leukemia, whereas specificity ranged from 86% for congestive heart failure to 100% for leukemia, dementia, and AIDS. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that search strategies that use automated electronic search strategies to extract Charlson comorbidities from the clinical notes contained within the electronic medical record are feasible and reliable. Automated digital algorithm outperformed ICD-9 codes in all the Charlson variables except leukemia, with greater sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.","['Singh, Balwinder', 'Singh, Amandeep', 'Ahmed, Adil', 'Wilson, Gregory A', 'Pickering, Brian W', 'Herasevich, Vitaly', 'Gajic, Ognjen', 'Li, Guangxi']","['Singh B', 'Singh A', 'Ahmed A', 'Wilson GA', 'Pickering BW', 'Herasevich V', 'Gajic O', 'Li G']","['Multidisciplinary Epidemiology and Translational Research in Intensive Care, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Comorbidity', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods', 'International Classification of Diseases']",2012/09/11 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(12)00679-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2012 Sep;87(9):817-24. doi: 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.015.,PMC3538495,"['RC1 LM010468/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 LM10468Z-01/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Mayo Clin Proc. 2012 Sep;87(9):811-3.

Pten is also mutated in human leukemias, but rarely in early childhood leukemias. We hypothesized that this reflects developmental changes in PI3-kinase pathway regulation. Here we show that Rictor deletion prevents leukemogenesis and HSC depletion after Pten deletion in adult mice, implicating mTORC2 activation in these processes. However, Rictor deletion had little effect on the function of normal HSCs. Moreover, Pten deletion from neonatal HSCs did not activate the PI3-kinase pathway or promote HSC proliferation, HSC depletion, or leukemogenesis. Pten is therefore required in adult, but not neonatal, HSCs to negatively regulate mTORC2 signaling. This demonstrates that some critical tumor suppressor mechanisms in adult cells are not required by neonatal cells. Developmental changes in key signaling pathways therefore confer temporal changes upon stem cell self-renewal and tumor suppressor mechanisms.","['Magee, Jeffrey A', 'Ikenoue, Tsuneo', 'Nakada, Daisuke', 'Lee, Jae Y', 'Guan, Kun-Liang', 'Morrison, Sean J']","['Magee JA', 'Ikenoue T', 'Nakada D', 'Lee JY', 'Guan KL', 'Morrison SJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (rictor protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aging/pathology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/05/31 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(12)00366-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Sep 7;11(3):415-28. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.026.,PMC3447536,"['HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA108941/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AG024945/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Sep 7;11(3):281-2.

In this study, we will analyze the gene expression profile of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia with real-time PCR arrays. METHODS: Real-time PCR array was designed and tested firstly. Then gene expression profile of 11 pediatric AML and 10 normal controls was analyzed with real-time PCR arrays. We analyzed the expression data with MEV (Multi Experiment View) cluster software. Datasets representing genes with altered expression profile derived from cluster analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool. RESULTS: We designed and tested 88 real-time PCR primer pairs for a quantitative gene expression analysis of key genes involved in pediatric AML. The gene expression profile of pediatric AML is significantly different from normal control; there are 19 genes up-regulated and 25 genes down-regulated in pediatric AML. To investigate possible biological interactions of differently regulated genes, datasets representing genes with altered expression profile were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool. The results revealed 12 significant networks. Of these networks, Cellular Development, Cellular Growth and Proliferation, Tumor Morphology was the highest rated network with 36 focus molecules and the significance score of 41. The IPA analysis also groups the differentially expressed genes into biological mechanisms that are related to hematological disease, cell death, cell growth and hematological system development. In the top canonical pathways, p53 and Huntington's disease signaling came out to be the top two most significant pathways with a p value of 1.5E-8 and2.95E-7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the gene expression profile of pediatric AML is significantly different from normal control; there are 19 genes up-regulated and 25 genes down-regulated in pediatric AML. We found some genes dyes-regulated in pediatric AML for the first time as FASLG, HDAC4, HDAC7 and some HOX family genes. IPA analysis showed the top important pathways for pediatric AML are p53 and Huntington's disease signaling.

This study was performed to investigate the effect of a novel synthetic (+/-) trans-dihydronarciclasine (code name; HYU-01) in AML. The HYU-01 inhibited the proliferation of various AML cell lines including HL-60 as well as primary leukemic blasts in a dose-dependent manner. To investigate the mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of HYU-01, cell-cycle analysis was attempted in HL-60 cells, resulting in G1 arrest. The expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E, and cyclin A were decreased in a time-dependent manner. In addition, HYU-01 up-regulated the expression of the p27, and markedly enhanced the binding of p27 with CDK2, 4, and 6, ultimately resulting in the decrease of their kinase activities. Furthermore, HYU-01 induced the apoptosis through the induction of proapoptotic molecules and reduction of antiapoptotic molecules in association with the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9.

This has raised the question as to whether enzymes that regulate the structure and function of chromatin might represent novel therapeutic targets. The histone demethylase LSD1 is one such candidate and novel, potent inhibitors are under development. AREAS COVERED: The literature on LSD1 (also known as KDM1A, AOF2, BHC110 or KIAA0601) was identified in Pubmed and is herein discussed. Areas covered include the structure and enzymatic activity of LSD1, its role in chromatin regulatory complexes, its functional roles in normal and malignant tissue, pharmacological inhibitors of its activity and their putative therapeutic roles. EXPERT OPINION: Pre-clinical data supporting a therapeutic role for LSD1 inhibitors are most encouraging in acute myeloid leukaemia, although optimal dosing strategies and beneficial combinations with other agents remain unclear. Studies making use of potent, selective LSD1 inhibitors active in the nanomolar range are required to establish therapeutic indications in other subtypes of haematological malignancy, and in solid tumours.","['Lynch, James T', 'Harris, William J', 'Somervaille, Tim C P']","['Lynch JT', 'Harris WJ', 'Somervaille TC']","['The University of Manchester, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Research UK Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120908,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Demethylases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2012.722206 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2012 Dec;16(12):1239-49. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2012.722206.

Therefore, we designed a protein construct to act as a mitochondrial chaperone to move Bcr-Abl to the mitochondria. The chaperone (i.e., the 43.6 kDa intracellular cryptic escort (iCE)) contains an EGFP tag and two previously characterized motifs: (1) an optimized Bcr-Abl binding motif that interacts with the coiled-coil domain of Bcr (ccmut3; 72 residues), and (2) a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal (cMTS; 51 residues) that selectively targets the mitochondria in oxidatively stressed cells (i.e., Bcr-Abl positive leukemic cells) via phosphorylation at a key residue (T193) by protein kinase C. While the iCE colocalized with Bcr-Abl, it did not relocalize to the mitochondria. However, the iCE was selectively toxic to Bcr-Abl positive K562 cells as compared to Bcr-Abl negative Cos-7 fibroblasts and 1471.1 murine breast cancer cells. The toxicity of the iCE to leukemic cells was equivalent to 10 muM imatinib at 48 h and the iCE combined with imatinib potentiated cell death beyond imatinib or the iCE alone. Substitution of either the ccmut3 or the cMTS with another Bcr-Abl binding domain (derived from Ras/Rab interaction protein 1 (RIN1; 295 residues)) or MTS (i.e., the canonical IMS derived from Smac/Diablo; 49 residues) did not match the cytotoxicity of the iCE. Additionally, a phosphorylation null mutant of the iCE also abolished the killing effect. The mitochondrial toxicity of Bcr-Abl and the iCE in Bcr-Abl positive K562 leukemia cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of 7-AAD, TUNEL, and annexin-V staining. DNA segmentation and cell viability were assessed by microscopy. Subcellular localization of constructs was determined using confocal microscopy (including statistical colocalization analysis). Overall, the iCE was highly active against K562 leukemia cells and the killing effect was dependent upon both the ccmut3 and functional cMTS domains.","['Constance, Jonathan E', 'Woessner, David W', 'Matissek, Karina J', 'Mossalam, Mohanad', 'Lim, Carol S']","['Constance JE', 'Woessner DW', 'Matissek KJ', 'Mossalam M', 'Lim CS']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121012,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp3003539 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2012 Nov 5;9(11):3318-29. doi: 10.1021/mp3003539.

Clofarabine acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA replication. Compared to its precursors, clofarabine has an increased resistance to deamination and phosphorolysis, and hence better stability as well as higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd), the rate-limiting step in nucleoside phosphorylation. Since the initiation of the first phase I study of clofarabine in 1993 in patients with hematologic and solid malignancies, clofarabine has demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in adult acute leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Due to its unique properties of biochemical modulation when used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, mainly cytarabine, combination regimens containing clofarabine have been evaluated. A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database and from abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials. This review describes the development, pharmacology and clinical activity of clofarabine, as well as its emerging role in the treatment of adult patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Ghanem, Hady', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Ghanem H', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ohanian M', 'Jabbour E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Recent studies have shown microRNA-21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in several types of cancer and contributes to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. In our previous studies, we found triptolide (TPL) could enhance adriamycin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in K562/A02 cells. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of TPL on the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to adriamycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Expression of mature miR-21 was determined by SYBER green PCR. The miR-21 mimics and inhibitors were chemically synthesized and transfected into K562 cells or K562/A02 cells. PTEN protein levels was determined by western blots. PTEN promoter activity was measured by luciferase assays. RESULTS: TPL (5 nmol/L) increased the sensitivity of K562/A02 to adriamycin. When adriamycin was combined with 5 nmol/L TPL, the mean apoptotic population of K562/A02 cells was increased from 4.3 to 18.5%, respectively. K562/A02 cells showed a significant reduction in miR-21 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) expressions after TPL treatment. K562/A02 cells that were transfected with the miR-21 inhibitor had a significantly higher PTEN protein level than the control. K562 cells that were pre-treated with PTEN siRNA had increased survival rate compared to the control group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that triptolide modulates the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to adriamycin by regulating miR-21 expression. Triptolide inhibited miR-21 expression and enhanced PTEN levels in K562/A02 cells.","['Li, Hao', 'Hui, Lulu', 'Xu, Wenlin', 'Shen, Huiling', 'Chen, Qiaoyun', 'Long, Lulu', 'Zhu, Xiaolan']","['Li H', 'Hui L', 'Xu W', 'Shen H', 'Chen Q', 'Long L', 'Zhu X']","[""Department of Central Laboratory,The Affiliated People's Hospital, Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2012/09/11 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2012.665931 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2012 Oct;50(10):1233-40. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2012.665931.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 30% of cases of AML have an unfavorable karyotype, and if treated with conventional chemotherapy, a complete response rate of about 50% and a 5-year overall survival of 10% to 20% are expected. Of those in the unfavorable group, almost half will have a complex karyotype, which is associated with a poorer outcome, and 40% of those will have a monosomal karyotype, which carries an even worse prognosis. The best chance for cure for patients with an unfavorable karyotype is seen in those who achieve a complete response and proceed to allogeneic transplant.

Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is up-regulated in several cancers and has been associated to poor prognosis. This prompted us to investigate the involvement of LMW-PTP in MDR. In this study, we investigated the role of LMW-PTP in a chemoresistant CML cell line, Lucena-1. Our results showed that LMW-PTP is highly expressed and 7-fold more active in Lucena-1 cells compared to K562 cells, the non-resistant cell line. Knocking down LMW-PTP in Lucena-1 cells reverted chemoresistance to vincristine and imatinib mesylate, followed by a decrease of Src and Bcr-Abl phosphorylation at the activating sites, inactivating both kinases. On the other hand, overexpression of LMW-PTP in K562 cells led to chemoresistance to vincristine. Our findings describe, for the first time, that LMW-PTP cooperates with MDR phenotype, at least in part, through maintaining Src and Bcr-Abl kinases in more active statuses. These findings suggest that inhibition of LMW-PTP may be a useful strategy for the development of therapies for multidrug resistant CML.","['Ferreira, Paula A', 'Ruela-de-Sousa, Roberta R', 'Queiroz, Karla C S', 'Souza, Ana Carolina S', 'Milani, Renato', 'Pilli, Ronaldo Aloise', 'Peppelenbosch, Maikel P', 'den Hertog, Jeroen', 'Ferreira, Carmen V']","['Ferreira PA', 'Ruela-de-Sousa RR', 'Queiroz KC', 'Souza AC', 'Milani R', 'Pilli RA', 'Peppelenbosch MP', 'den Hertog J', 'Ferreira CV']","['Laboratory of Bioassays and Signal Transduction, Biochemistry Department, Biology Institute, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120905,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044312 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-12844 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44312. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044312.

Extra-medullary involvement by AML can present in a variety of clinical manifestations, most notably in the form of myeloid sarcoma, leukemia cutis, and central nervous system involvement. Each presents a unique clinical scenario in terms of symptoms and management. Extramedullary disease in any form presenting without evidence of bone marrow disease is still considered evidence of systemic disease and is usually treated as such. Most commonly, extramedullary disease presents concurrently with bone marrow disease, and although it may require additional local therapy in the form of intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation, the principles of systemic treatment remain unchanged. The prognostic impact of extramedullary disease is unclear. Specifically, whether hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered in first remission irrespective of other prognostic factors has not been established. Patients who undergo transplantation have similar outcomes as patients without extramedullary disease, although they do have a higher rate of extramedullary relapse.

Although EZH2 is overexpressed in many solid cancers, the role of EZH2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains largely unexplored. In a microarray experiment, we found that EZH2 was significantly upregulated in Nalm-6 cells and this was associated with the silencing of tumor suppressor genes p21, p53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The abnormal expression of these genes was further confirmed by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis on Nalm-6 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that EZH2 and H3K27me3 were both enriched in the promoter region of PTEN and p21 in Nalm-6 cells but not in normal B cells. Functional analysis showed that siRNA-mediated EZH2 knockdown led to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells, accompanied by the reactivation of PTEN and p21 expression. Furthermore, we found that EZH2 inhibitor deazaneplanocin A promoted vincristine sulfate-induced apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that EZH2 is overexpressed in B-ALL and promotes the progression of B-ALL by directly mediating the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes p21 and PTEN, and could serve as a potential epigenetic target for B-ALL therapy.","['Chen, Jianhe', 'Li, Jing', 'Han, Qin', 'Sun, Zhao', 'Wang, Jing', 'Wang, Shihua', 'Zhao, Robert C H']","['Chen J', 'Li J', 'Han Q', 'Sun Z', 'Wang J', 'Wang S', 'Zhao RC']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences & School of Basic Medicine, Center of Excellence in Tissue Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120906,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2012/09/08 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ebm.2012.012075 [pii]', '10.1258/ebm.2012.012075 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2012 Sep;237(9):1110-6. doi: 10.1258/ebm.2012.012075.

This T cell effector function has been shown to be defective in various murine tumor models and in human cancer. However, factors and their mechanisms that cause inhibition of CD8(+) T cell lytic function in tumor-bearing hosts remain to be fully defined. We postulate that gangliosides, highly expressed on tumor cell membranes, actively shed into the tumor microenvironment, and having well-established immunosuppressive properties, may be such a factor. We exposed primary mouse CD8(+) CTL to gangliosides derived from three sources (tumors and normal brain). This significantly inhibited cytotoxicity-mediated by granule exocytosis, that is, cytotoxicity of alloantigen-specific and polyclonal CD8(+) CTL in vitro. These molecules did not interfere with the interaction of CD8(+) T cells with their cognate targets. Rather, they inhibited lytic granule release in response both to TCR engagement and to stimuli that induce granule release in a nonpolarized manner. At the subcellular level, confocal microscopic imaging identified inhibition of polarization of lytic granules to the immunological synapse upon target cell recognition. Thus, tumor-shed gangliosides suppress lytic activity of CD8(+) T cells by a novel mechanism, that is, inhibition of trafficking of lytic granules in response to TCR engagement, as well as by interfering with the process of granule exocytosis in CD8(+) T cells.","['Lee, Hee Chul', 'Wondimu, Assefa', 'Liu, Yihui', 'Ma, Jennifer S Y', 'Radoja, Sasa', 'Ladisch, Stephan']","['Lee HC', 'Wondimu A', 'Liu Y', 'Ma JS', 'Radoja S', 'Ladisch S']","[""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120905,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '12707-58-3 (ganglioside, GD1a)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Exocytosis/*immunology', 'Gangliosides/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Immunological Synapses/chemistry/immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2012/09/08 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1201256 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1201256 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Oct 1;189(7):3521-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1201256.

We investigated the induction of peripheral neuropathy after LP-BM5 infection in B6 mice. Infected B6 mice, like HIV-infected humans, exhibited behavioral (increased sensitivity to mechanical and heat stimuli) and pathological (transient loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers) signs of peripheral neuropathy. The levels of viral gag RNA were significantly increased in all tissues tested, including spleen, paw skin, lumbar dorsal root ganglia, and lumbar spinal cord, postinfection (p.i.). Correlated with the development of peripheral neuropathy, the tissue levels of several cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12, were significantly elevated p.i. These increases had cytokine-specific and tissue-specific profiles and kinetics. Further, treatment with the antiretroviral agent zidovudine either significantly reduced or completely reversed the aforementioned behavioral, pathologic, and cytokine changes p.i.

Conditional deletion of genes encoding the E26-transformation-specific transcription factors, PU.1 and Spi-B, in B cells (DeltaPB mice) leads to B-ALL in mice at 100% incidence rate and with a median survival of 21 wk. We hypothesized that PU.1 and Spi-B may redundantly activate transcription of genes encoding tumor suppressors in the B cell lineage. Characterization of aging DeltaPB mice showed that leukemia cells expressing IL-7R were found in enlarged thymuses. IL-7R-expressing B-ALL cells grew in culture in response to IL-7 and could be maintained as cell lines. Cultured DeltaPB cells expressed reduced levels of B cell linker protein (BLNK), a known tumor suppressor gene, compared with controls.

In the past, therapies for these diseases were limited and patients who elected to receive treatment were subject to highly toxic, inpatient chemotherapeutics, which were often ineffective. In the era of hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), a patient with high grade MDS or AML with multilineage dysplasia can be offered the alternative of outpatient, relatively low-toxicity therapy. Despite the fact that CR (CR) rates to such agents remain relatively low at 15-20%, a much larger percentage of patients will have clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin, platelet, and neutrophil counts while maintaining good outpatient quality of life. As our clinical experience with azanucleotides expands, questions regarding patient selection, optimal dosing strategy, latency to best response and optimal duration of therapy following disease progression remain, but there is no question that for some patients these agents offer, for a time, an almost miraculous clinical benefit. Ongoing clinical trials in combination and in sequence with conventional therapeutics, with other epigenetically active agents, or in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation continue to provide promise for optimization of these agents for patients with myeloid disease. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the proven efficacy of these agents remain a matter of some controversy, activity is thought to stem from induction of DNA hypomethylation, direct DNA damage, or possibly even immune modulation; there is no question that they have become a permanent part of the armamentarium against myeloid neoplasms.","['Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Griffiths EA', 'Gore SD']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. elizabeth.griffiths@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2012/09/08 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4419-9967-2_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;754:253-83. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4419-9967-2_13.,PMC4086806,['K24 CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['NIHMS490249'],,,,,,,,,,

Patients received a standard dose of enocitabine (200 mg/m(2) x 8 days) and daunorubicin (30 mg/m(2) x days 1-3) plus an escalating dose of GO (1.5-5 mg/m(2) on day 4). The dose escalation of GO was done according to a standard 3 + 3 design following a modified Fibonacci sequence. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in three patients (median age, 71) at level 1 (1.5 mg/m(2)) or in three patients (median age, 73) at level 2 (3 mg/m(2)). Neither veno-occlusive diseases nor sinusoidal obstructive syndromes were noted at either level. However, as GO was withdrawn from the US market in June 2010, based on a randomized study in newly diagnosed AML, we decided not to proceed to the level 3 (5 mg/m(2)) in order to avoid possibly more severe adverse effects, and also because all six patients experienced grade 4 myelosuppression, with complete remission in three. This study showed that 3 mg/m(2) of GO in combination with enocitabine and daunorubicin may be a recommendable dose for a phase 2 study in Japanese elderly patients with CD33-positive AML.

METHODS: Adult participants who were 10+ years from their childhood ALL diagnosis and members of the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study were recruited between December 2007 and March 2011. During their risk-based medical evaluations, they underwent quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to evaluate BMD. Incidental renal stones were identified by radiologists' review of axial QCT source images. Demographic and dietary information were abstracted from health surveys and the Block Food Frequency questionnaire, respectively. The multivariable logistic regression model was used for analysis. RESULTS: At a median of 26.1 years from diagnosis, BMD Z scores were </=-2 in 34 of 662 (5.2 %) and renal stones detected in 73 of 662 (11 %) participants. Adjusted for age, renal radiation, dietary vitamin D, gender, and body mass index, when compared to those with BMD Z scores >/=0, the risk of renal stones was increased among those with BMD Z scores </=-2 (odds ratio [OR], 2.92; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.14-7.48). Risk of renal stones significantly increased for older age (45-54 vs.18-24 years; OR, 3.70; 95 % CI 1.11-12.35) whereas the risk was higher but nonsignificant for >141.5 IU (sample median) daily intake of vitamin D (OR, 1.64; 95 % CI 0.98-2.75). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Older ALL survivors with BMD Z scores </=-2 are at risk for renal stones and should be counseled so that appropriate follow-up care can be provided for those among whom renal stones are detected.","['Gawade, Prasad L', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Sharma, Shelly', 'Li, Zhenghong', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Spunt, Sheri L', 'Nottage, Kerri', 'Krasin, Matthew J', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Gawade PL', 'Ness KK', 'Sharma S', 'Li Z', 'Srivastava DK', 'Spunt SL', 'Nottage K', 'Krasin MJ', 'Hudson MM', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control MSN 735, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. prasad.gawade@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120906,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Bone Density/*physiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Calculi/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/mortality/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-012-0241-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2012 Dec;6(4):388-97. doi: 10.1007/s11764-012-0241-y.

Aberrant expression of miRNAs appears to be a common characteristic of hematological malignancies including leukemias. AIM: Here we review the available data supporting a role of aberrant expression of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of leukemias including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CONCLUSIONS: The expression signatures of miRNAs provide exciting opportunities in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of leukemia. Since miRNAs can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in leukemogenesis, the potential of using these small RNAs as therapeutic targets opens up new opportunities for leukemia therapy by either inhibiting or augmenting their activity.","['Babashah, Sadegh', 'Sadeghizadeh, Majid', 'Tavirani, Mostafa Rezaei', 'Farivar, Shirin', 'Soleimani, Masoud']","['Babashah S', 'Sadeghizadeh M', 'Tavirani MR', 'Farivar S', 'Soleimani M']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, 1411713116, Tehran, Iran. sadegh.babashah@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120907,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-012-0095-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2012 Oct;35(5):317-34. doi: 10.1007/s13402-012-0095-3.

As exemplified by Imatinib (Gleevec), a specific inhibitor of the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia-associated BCR/ABL kinase, these agents promise impressive activity in clinical trials, with low levels of clinical toxicity. However, such therapy is susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance mainly due to amino acid substitutions in the target protein. Defining the spectrum of such mutations is important for patient monitoring and the design of next-generation inhibitors. Using Imatinib and BCR/ABL as a paradigm for a drug-target pair, we reported a retroviral vector-based screening strategy to identify the spectrum of resistance-conferring mutations, which has helped in designing the next-generation BCR/ABL inhibitors such as Nilotinib, Dasatinib, and Ponatinib.

The Mr 37/67 kD laminin receptor (LAMR) has been suggested to be the receptor for Sindbis virus. However, JB cells, which are infected by Sindbis at low efficiency, express high levels of LAMR, revealing that additional factors are involved in Sindbis tropism. To test the infectivity and therapeutic efficacy of Sindbis vectors against malignant hematopoietic cells in vivo, we injected BW5147 cells intraperitoneally into (C3HXAKR) F1 hybrid mice. We found that Sindbis vectors targeted the tumors and significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. We also tested the Sindbis vectors in a transgenic CD4-Rgr model, which spontaneously develop thymic lymphomas. However, infectivity in this model was less efficient. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sindbis vectors have the potential to target and kill hematopoietic malignancies in mice, but further research is needed to evaluate the mechanism underlining the susceptibility of human lymphoid malignancies to Sindbis therapy.","['Suzme, R', 'Tseng, J-C', 'Levin, B', 'Ibrahim, S', 'Meruelo, D', 'Pellicer, A']","['Suzme R', 'Tseng JC', 'Levin B', 'Ibrahim S', 'Meruelo D', 'Pellicer A']","['Department of Pathology and NYU Cancer Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.

Enhancing efferocytosis has been proposed as strategy to treat diseases involving inflammation. Here we present the strategy to increase 'eat me' signals on the surface of apoptotic cells by targeting cell surface-expressed phosphatidylserine (PS) with a variant of annexin A5 (Arg-Gly-Asp-annexin A5, RGD-anxA5) that has gained the function to interact with alpha(v)beta(3) receptors of the phagocyte. We describe design and characterization of RGD-anxA5 and show that introduction of RGD transforms anxA5 from an inhibitor into a stimulator of efferocytosis. RGD-anxA5 enhances engulfment of apoptotic cells by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cells in vitro and resident peritoneal mouse macrophages in vivo. In addition, RGD-anxA5 augments secretion of interleukin-10 during efferocytosis in vivo, thereby possibly adding to an anti-inflammatory environment. We conclude that targeting cell surface-expressed PS is an attractive strategy for treatment of inflammatory diseases and that the rationally designed RGD-anxA5 is a promising therapeutic agent.","['Schutters, K', 'Kusters, D H M', 'Chatrou, M L L', 'Montero-Melendez, T', 'Donners, M', 'Deckers, N M', 'Krysko, D V', 'Vandenabeele, P', 'Perretti, M', 'Schurgers, L J', 'Reutelingsperger, C P M']","['Schutters K', 'Kusters DH', 'Chatrou ML', 'Montero-Melendez T', 'Donners M', 'Deckers NM', 'Krysko DV', 'Vandenabeele P', 'Perretti M', 'Schurgers LJ', 'Reutelingsperger CP']","['Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, University of Maastricht, Maastricht 6200 MD, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphatidylserines/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/08/16 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2012107 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2012.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Jan;20(1):49-56. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2012.107.

We now describe a new, evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response characterised by a striking, but reversible, reorganisation of ER membranes that occurs independently of the UPR, resulting in impaired ER transport and function. This reorganisation is characterised by a dramatic redistribution and clustering of ER membrane proteins. ER membrane aggregation is regulated, in part, by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, particularly MCL-1. Using connectivity mapping, we report the widespread occurrence of this stress response by identifying several structurally diverse chemicals from different pharmacological classes, including antihistamines, antimalarials and antipsychotics, which induce ER membrane reorganisation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of ER membrane aggregation to result in pathological consequences, such as the long-QT syndrome, a cardiac arrhythmic abnormality, arising because of a novel trafficking defect of the human ether-a-go-go-related channel protein from the ER to the plasma membrane. Thus, ER membrane reorganisation is a feature of a new cellular stress pathway, clearly distinct from the UPR, with important consequences affecting the normal functioning of the ER.","['Varadarajan, S', 'Bampton, E T W', 'Smalley, J L', 'Tanaka, K', 'Caves, R E', 'Butterworth, M', 'Wei, J', 'Pellecchia, M', 'Mitcheson, J', 'Gant, T W', 'Dinsdale, D', 'Cohen, G M']","['Varadarajan S', 'Bampton ET', 'Smalley JL', 'Tanaka K', 'Caves RE', 'Butterworth M', 'Wei J', 'Pellecchia M', 'Mitcheson J', 'Gant TW', 'Dinsdale D', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120907,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (apogossypol)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/metabolism', 'Gossypol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/04/18 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2012108 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2012.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2012 Dec;19(12):1896-907. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2012.108.

Three isoforms of Pim kinases have been identified and are known to phosphorylate numerous substrates, with regulatory functions in transcription, translation, cell cycle, and survival pathways. These kinases are involved in production, proliferation, and survival of normal B cells and are overexpressed in B-cell malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). SGI-1776 is a small molecule and Pim kinase inhibitor with selectivity for Pim-1. We hypothesize that Pim kinase function can be inhibited by SGI-1776 in MCL and that inhibition of phosphorylation of downstream substrates will disrupt transcriptional, translational, and cell cycle processes and promote cell death. SGI-1776 treatment in 4 MCL cell lines resulted in apoptosis induction. Phosphorylation of transcription (c-Myc) and translation targets (4E-BP1), tested in Jeko-1 and Mino, was declined. Consistent with these data, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 protein levels were decreased. Importantly, similar to cell line data, MCL primary cells but not normal cells showed similar inhibition of substrate phosphorylation and cytotoxicity from SGI-1776 treatment. Genetic knockdown of Pim-1/Pim-2 affected similar proteins in MCL cell lines.

Hyperactive JAK/STAT and PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is common in this high-risk subset. We, therefore, investigated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in xenograft models of 8 pediatric B-ALL cases with and without CRLF2 and JAK genomic lesions.

Enhanced responses to ruxolitinib were observed in samples harboring JAK-activating lesions and higher levels of STAT5 phosphorylation. Rapamycin controlled leukemia burden in all 8 B-ALL samples. Survival analysis of 2 representative B-ALL xenografts demonstrated prolonged survival with rapamycin treatment compared with vehicle (P < .01).

This event is also sustained by detrimental stromal changes, such as BM fibrosis and osteosclerosis, whose occurrence is harbinger of a dismal prognosis. We show that the matricellular protein SPARC contributes to the BM stromal response to myeloproliferation. The degree of SPARC expression in BM stromal elements, including CD146(+) mesenchymal stromal cells, correlates with the degree of stromal changes, and the severity of BM failure characterizing the prototypical myeloproliferative neoplasm primary myelofibrosis. Using Sparc(-/-) mice and BM chimeras, we demonstrate that SPARC contributes to the development of significant stromal fibrosis in a model of thrombopoietin-induced myelofibrosis. We found that SPARC deficiency in the radioresistant BM stroma compartment impairs myelofibrosis but, at the same time, associates with an enhanced reactive myeloproliferative response to thrombopoietin. The link betwen SPARC stromal deficiency and enhanced myeloid cell expansion under a myeloproliferative spur is also supported by the myeloproliferative phenotype resulting from the transplantation of defective Apc(min) mutant hematopoietic cells into Sparc(-/-) but not WT recipient BM stroma.

We previously developed BH3 profiling, a functional assay that assesses mitochondrial depolarization in response to BH3-only peptides, to measure ""apoptotic priming,"" the proximity of a cell to the apoptotic threshold. In the present study, we use BH3 profiling to show that CLL cells from the PB are highly primed. Increased priming is associated with improved clinical response and, unexpectedly, with unmutated IGHV status. Coculturing CLL cells in vitro with stroma decreases priming. Using matched PB, BM, and lymph node compartment samples, we found in vivo that BM-derived CLL cells are the least primed. CLL cells cocultured with stroma were treated with the PI3K delta-isoform inhibitor CAL-101 (GS1101). CAL-101 caused CLL cell de-adhesion, leading to increased CLL cell priming. Stimulation of CLL cells with anti-IgM or CXCL12 caused decreased priming that could be reversed by CAL-101. Our results show that inhibition of stromal interactions leading to displacement of CLL cells into the blood by CAL-101 in vivo may increase CLL cell priming, suggesting a mechanism by which agents inducing lymphocyte redistribution might facilitate improved clinical response when used in combination with other therapies.","['Davids, Matthew S', 'Deng, Jing', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Lannutti, Brian J', 'Wang, Lili', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Davids MS', 'Deng J', 'Wiestner A', 'Lannutti BJ', 'Wang L', 'Wu CJ', 'Wilson WH', 'Brown JR', 'Letai A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120905,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/*immunology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/immunology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46242-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-414060 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 25;120(17):3501-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-414060.

For such situations of rural PM would promote contacts between infected and susceptible individuals, the latter tending to have a higher than average prevalence in rural or isolated areas. Confusion has arisen from some workers applying the term PM to non-rural situations lacking known recent change. METHODS: Available PM studies using the original definition of influxes were examined, a meta-analysis carried out of studies of CL in relation to exposure to high levels of rural PM, and also a detailed analysis by age group. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of 17 studies shows a significant CL excess in association with rural PM: overall relative risk (RR) at ages 0-14: 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.44-1.72; at 0-4 years 1.72 (1.54-1.91). This contrasts with the absence of an excess of CL in similarly exposed urban areas (RR 1.00; 0.93-1.07), pointing to a high level of immunity there. The mixed results of studies using other definitions of PM were summarised. The excess associated with rural PM below age 2 years (RR 1.51; 1.17, 1.92) was not appreciably different from that at later childhood ages. CONCLUSION: Much of the inconsistency among studies ostensibly about CL and PM reflects the use of definitions other than that originally proposed. The broad similarity of the CL excess below age 2 with that at older childhood ages is inconsistent with the Greaves' delayed infection hypothesis, since any infection underlying the former is difficult to consider as delayed.","['Kinlen, L J']",['Kinlen LJ'],"['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK. leo.kinlen@gtc.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20120906,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012402 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.402 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Sep 25;107(7):1163-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.402.

METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2011, all patients with newly diagnosed AML were consecutively registered and prospectively monitored at 30 Italian hematological centers. Our analysis focused on adult patients who received intensive chemotherapy and a mold-active AFP for at least 5 days. To determine the efficacy of prophylaxis, invasive fungal disease (IFD) incidence, IFD-attributable mortality, and overall survival were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 515 patients were included in the present analysis. Posaconazole was the most frequently prescribed drug (260 patients [50%]) followed by fluconazole (148 [29%]) and itraconazole (93 [18%]). When comparing the groups taking posaconazole and itraconazole, there were no significant differences in the baseline clinical characteristics, whereas there were significant differences in the percentage of breakthrough IFDs (18.9% with posaconazole and 38.7% with itraconazole, P< .001). The same trend was observed when only proven/probable mold infections were considered (posaconazole, 2.7% vs itraconazole, 10.7%, P= .02). There were no significant differences in the IFD-associated mortality rate, while posaconazole prophylaxis had a significant impact on overall survival at day 90 (P= .002). CONCLUSIONS: During the last years, the use of posaconazole prophylaxis in high-risk patients has significantly increased. Although our study was not randomized, it demonstrates in a real-life setting that posaconazole prophylaxis confers an advantage in terms of both breakthrough IFDs and overall survival compared to itraconazole prophylaxis.

Objectives were to identify factors associated with infection, sepsis, and infectious deaths in children with newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included children </= 18 years of age with de novo, non-M3 AML diagnosed between January 1995 and December 2004, treated at 15 Canadian centers. Patients were monitored for infection from initiation of AML treatment until recovery from the last cycle of chemotherapy, conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, relapse, persistent disease, or death (whichever occurred first). Consistent trained research associates abstracted all information from each site. RESULTS: 341 patients were included. Median age was 7.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0-13.5) and 29 (8.5%) had Down syndrome. In sum, 26 (7.6%) experienced death as a first event. There were 1277 courses of chemotherapy administered in which sterile site microbiologically documented infection occurred in 313 courses (24.5%). Sepsis and infectious death occurred in 97 (7.6%) and 16 (1.3%) courses, respectively. The median days of corticosteroid administration was 2 per course (IQR, 0-6). In multiple regression analysis, duration of corticosteroid exposure was significantly associated with more microbiologically documented sterile site infection, bacteremia, fungal infection, and sepsis. The only factor significantly associated with infectious death was days of corticosteroid exposure (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric AML, infection, sepsis, and infectious death were associated with duration of corticosteroid exposure. Corticosteroids should be avoided when possible for this population.","['Dix, David', 'Cellot, Sonia', 'Price, Victoria', 'Gillmeister, Biljana', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Johnston, Donna L', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Mitchell, David', 'Stobart, Kent', 'Yanofsky, Rochelle', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Silva, Mariana', 'Bowes, Lynette', 'Zelcer, Shayna', 'Brossard, Josee', 'Traubici, Jeffrey', 'Allen, Upton', 'Beyene, Joseph', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Dix D', 'Cellot S', 'Price V', 'Gillmeister B', 'Ethier MC', 'Johnston DL', 'Lewis V', 'Michon B', 'Mitchell D', 'Stobart K', 'Yanofsky R', 'Portwine C', 'Silva M', 'Bowes L', 'Zelcer S', 'Brossard J', 'Traubici J', 'Allen U', 'Beyene J', 'Sung L']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120905,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/epidemiology', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*microbiology/surgery/therapy', 'Male', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/07/11 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cis774 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/cis774 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Dec;55(12):1608-14. doi: 10.1093/cid/cis774.

We assessed the outcomes of 108 CLL patients undergoing first allogeneic HSCTs, 76 with reduced-intensity (RIC) and 32 with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) between 1998 and 2009 at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. With median follow-up of 5.9 years in surviving patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort is 63% for RIC regimens and 49% for MAC regimens (P=0.18). The risk of death declined significantly starting in 2004, and we found that 5-year OS for HSCT between 2004 and 2009 was 83% for RIC regimens compared with 47% for MAC regimens (P=0.003). For RIC transplantation, we developed a prognostic model based on predictors of progression-free survival (PFS), specifically remission status, lactate dehydrogenase, comorbidity score and lymphocyte count, and found 5-year PFS to be 83% for Score 0, 63% for Score 1, 24% for Score 2 and 6% for Score >/=3 (P<0.0001).

When both HLC and FLC testing were applied for response assessment, clonal excess was noted in 14/31 patients with complete response (CR). HLC ratio indicated presence of disease in 8/31 patients who achieved CR and, in sequential studies indicated evolving relapse in three patients before IFE became positive.

METHODS: CD33+/CD34- cells from patients with AML-M2 were taken as targeted cells, CD33+/ CD34- cells from normal people were taken as anti-selecting cells, and aptamers in the single strand deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) library were then selected repeatedly by cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (C-SELEX) technology, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate sub-ssDNA library. During the experiment, PCR amplification with fluorescently labeled primer and flow cytometry were performed to analyze the aptamers'enrichment of sub-library, and the final round product of the sub-ssDNA library was cloned. After the sequencing, the primary and secondary structures of the aptamers were analyzed. RESULTS: Electrophoresis indicated that the product of PCR amplification for each round subssDNA library was able to see a clear DNA band in the agarose gel. After 13 rounds of screening, the fluorescence intensity of the sub-ssDNA library binding the cells ranged from 2.14% to 51.12%, reaching a steady state at the 13th round. A total of 30 clones were selected and sequenced, 22 of which contained 1 of the 4 conserved sequences of AAGTA, TATCT, AGATG and AAATT in their primary structure, but the remained eight aptamers contained none of the conserved sequence. Secondary structure analysis indicated that four stem-loops and loop simulation convex structures existed in the aptamers. CONCLUSION: C-SELEX technology can be used to screen the aptamers binding primary cells from patients with leukemia. The aptamers selected from the CD33+/CD34- cells from the patients of AML-M2 subtype might be used for the diagnosis and treatment for leukemia.","['Zhu, Ping', 'Wang, Guangping', 'Zhang, Shuqin', 'Xu, Yajing', 'Peng, Minyuan', 'Yin, Hui', 'Chen, Yan', 'Tan, Sanqin', 'Chen, Fangping']","['Zhu P', 'Wang G', 'Zhang S', 'Xu Y', 'Peng M', 'Yin H', 'Chen Y', 'Tan S', 'Chen F']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

RECENT FINDINGS: Research has established 'missing self-recognition' as the mechanism underlying NK cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effects in T-cell-depleted haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation and has clarified optimal transplantation protocols to harness NK cell alloreactivity. SUMMARY: In the past decade, clinical studies have shown that the benefits of donor-versus-recipient NK cell alloreactivity in haploidentical transplantation are triggered by specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I mismatches. Donor HLA is crucial for driving NK cell education so that reconstituting NK cells mature as donor-tolerant and recipient-alloreactive. Transplantation of large doses of extensively T-cell-depleted hematopoietic grafts with no posttransplant immune suppression was found to be essential for development of NK cell alloreactivity. Clinical trials demonstrated that donor-versus-recipient NK cell alloreactivity is a key therapeutic element in haploidentical transplants for acute myeloblastic leukemia in adults and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. Moreover, in pilot studies, mature haploidentical NK cells were transiently transferred into lymphoablated patients with acute leukemia in remission. The results showed NK cell therapy may be a promising strategy for consolidating leukemia remission. In line with the notion that NK cell function is regulated by a balance between activating and inhibitory receptors, in the matched transplant setting, transplantation from donors possessing certain activating NK receptors (activating killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors) appeared to protect from relapse and improved survival.","['Velardi, Andrea']",['Velardi A'],"['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. velardi@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283590395 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Nov;19(6):421-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283590395.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For several decades, selective inhibition of DHFR has proven to be a potent therapeutic approach in the treatment of various cancers including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteogenic sarcoma, carcinoma of the breast, and head and neck cancer. Therapeutic success with DHFR inhibitor methotrexate (MTX) has been compromised in the clinic, which limits the success of MTX treatment by both acquired and intrinsic resistance mechanisms. We report that benzamide riboside (BR), via anabolism to benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD) known to potently inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), also inhibits cell growth through a mechanism involving downregulation of DHFR protein. Evidence to support this second site of action of BR includes the finding that CCRF-CEM/R human T-cell lymphoblasic leukemia cells, resistant to MTX as a consequence of gene amplification and overexpression of DHFR, are more resistant to BR than are parental cells. Studies of the mechanism by which BR lowers DHFR showed that BR, through its metabolite BAD, reduced NADP and NADPH cellular levels by inhibiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (NADK). As consequence of the lack of NADPH, DHFR was shown to be destabilized. We suggest that, inhibition of NADK is a new approach to downregulate DHFR and to inhibit cell growth.","['Roussel, Breton', 'Johnson-Farley, Nadine', 'Kerrigan, John E', 'Scotto, Kathleen W', 'Banerjee, Debabrata', 'Felczak, Krzysztof', 'Pankiewicz, Krzysztof W', 'Gounder, Murugesan', 'Lin, HongXia', 'Abali, Emine Ercikan', 'Bertino, Joseph R']","['Roussel B', 'Johnson-Farley N', 'Kerrigan JE', 'Scotto KW', 'Banerjee D', 'Felczak K', 'Pankiewicz KW', 'Gounder M', 'Lin H', 'Abali EE', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Medicine, Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120906,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '138385-29-2 (3-(1-deoxyribofuranosyl)benzamide)', '156724-91-3 (benzamide adenine nucleotide)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.23 (NAD kinase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Benzamides/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'NADP/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['21786 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.21786 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2012 Nov;13(13):1290-8. doi: 10.4161/cbt.21786.

They can be differentiated into many cell types and therefore hold great potential in the field of regenerative medicine. MSCs can be converted into beating cardiomyocytes by treating them with DNA-demethylating agents. Some of these compounds are nucleoside analogs that are widely used for studying the role of DNA methylation in biological processes as well as for the clinical treatment of leukemia and other carcinomas. AIMS: To achieve a better therapeutic option for cardiovascular regeneration, this study was carried out using MSCs treated with two synthetic compounds, zebularine and 5-azacytidine. It can be expected that treated MSCs prior to transplantation may increase the likelihood of successful regeneration of damaged myocardium. METHODS: The optimized concentrations of these compounds were added separately into the culture medium and the treated cells were analyzed for the expression of cardiac-specific genes by RT-PCR and cardiac-specific proteins by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Treated MSCs were cocultured with cardiomyocytes to see the fusion capability of these cells. RESULTS: mRNA and protein expressions of GATA4, Nkx2.5, and cardiac troponin T were observed in the treated MSCs. Coculture studies of MSCs and cardiomyocytes have shown improved fusion with zebularine-treated MSCs as compared to untreated and 5-azacytidine-treated MSCs. CONCLUSION: The study is expected to put forth another valuable aspect of certain compounds, that is, induction of transdifferentiation of MSCs into cardiomyocytes. This would serve as a tool for modified cellular therapy and may increase the probability of better myocardial regeneration.","['Naeem, Nadia', 'Haneef, Kanwal', 'Kabir, Nurul', ""Iqbal, Hana'a"", 'Jamall, Siddiqua', 'Salim, Asmat']","['Naeem N', 'Haneef K', 'Kabir N', 'Iqbal H', 'Jamall S', 'Salim A']","['Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cardiovasc Ther,Cardiovascular therapeutics,101319630,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata4 protein, rat)', '0 (Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nkx2-5 protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Troponin T)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Troponin T/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/08 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1755-5922.2012.00320.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cardiovasc Ther. 2013 Aug;31(4):201-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1755-5922.2012.00320.x.,,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'Cardiomyocytes', 'Demethylating agent', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Transdifferentiation', 'Zebularine']",,,,,,,

These results strongly suggest that ACAN may have cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic potential, due to its ability to activate the p38 MAPK-mediated signalling pathways.","['Kim, Kil-Nam', 'Ham, Young Min', 'Moon, Ji-Young', 'Kim, Min-Jin', 'Jung, Yong-Hwan', 'Jeon, You-Jin', 'Lee, Nam Ho', 'Kang, Nalae', 'Yang, Hye-Mi', 'Kim, Daekyung', 'Hyun, Chang-Gu']","['Kim KN', 'Ham YM', 'Moon JY', 'Kim MJ', 'Jung YH', 'Jeon YJ', 'Lee NH', 'Kang N', 'Yang HM', 'Kim D', 'Hyun CG']","['Jeju center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Jeju 690-140, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,England,Food Chem,Food chemistry,7702639,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (acanthoic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Eleutherococcus/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2012/09/08 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/09/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0308-8146(12)00897-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.05.067 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem. 2012 Dec 1;135(3):2112-7. doi: 10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.05.067.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in eight semiconductor factories between 1998 and 2008. The number of subjects was 113,443 for mortality and 108,443 for incidence. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. RESULTS: The SMR of leukemia was 0.39 (95% Confidence Interval 0.08-1.14) in males (2 cases) and 1.37 (0.55-2.81) in females (7 cases). The SMR of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was 1.33 (0.43-3.09, 5 cases) in males and 2.5 (0.68-6.40, 4 cases) in females. The SIR of leukemia was 0.69 (0.30-1.37, 8 cases) in males and 1.28 (0.61-2.36, 10 cases) in females. The SIR of NHL in females was 2.31 (1.23-3.95, 13 cases) and that of thyroid cancer in males was 2.11 (1.49-2.89, 38 cases). The excess incidence of NHL was significant in female assembly operators [SIR=3.15 (1.02-7.36, 5 cases)], but not significant in fabrication workers. The SIR of NHL in the group working for 1-5 years was higher than the SIR of NHL for those working for more than five years. The excess incidence of male thyroid cancer was observed in both office and manufacturing workers. CONCLUSION: There was no significant increase of leukemia in the Korean semiconductor industry. However, the incidence of NHL in females and thyroid cancer in males were significantly increased even though there was no definite association between work and those diseases in subgroup analysis according to work duration. This result should be interpreted cautiously, because the majority of the cohort was young and the number of cases was small.","['Lee, Hye-Eun', 'Kim, Eun-A', 'Park, Jungsun', 'Kang, Seong-Kyu']","['Lee HE', 'Kim EA', 'Park J', 'Kang SK']","['Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110630,Korea (South),Saf Health Work,Safety and health at work,101542940,,,,2011/06/01 00:00,2011/06/01 00:01,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5491/SHAW.2011.2.2.135 [doi]', 'S2093-7911(11)22005-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Saf Health Work. 2011 Jun;2(2):135-47. doi: 10.5491/SHAW.2011.2.2.135.

This study evaluated the possibility of exposure to carcinogenic agents for the cases. METHODS: Clinical courses were reviewed with assessing possible exposure to carcinogenic agents related to LHP cancers. Chemicals used at six major semiconductor companies in Korea were reviewed. Airborne monitoring for chemicals, including benzene, was conducted and the ionizing radiation dose was measured from 2008 to 2010. RESULTS: The latency of seven cases (five leukemiae, a Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and an aplastic anemia) ranged from 16 months to 15 years and 5 months. Most chemical measurements were at levels of less than 10% of the Korean Occupational Exposure Limit value. No carcinogens related to LHP cancers were used or detected. Complete-shielded radiation-generating devices were used, but the ionizing radiation doses were 0.20-0.22 uSv/hr (background level: 0.21 microSv/hr). Airborne benzene was detected at 0.31 ppb when the detection limit was lowered as low as possible. Ethylene oxide and formaldehyde were not found in the cases' processes, while these two were determined to be among the 263 chemicals in the list that was used at the six semiconductor companies at levels lower than 0.1%. Exposures occurring before 2002 could not be assessed because of the lack of information. CONCLUSION: Considering the possibility of exposure to carcinogenic agents, we could not find any convincing evidence for occupational exposure in all investigated cases. However, further study is needed because the semiconductor industry is a newly developing one.","['Kim, Eun-A', 'Lee, Hye-Eun', 'Ryu, Hyung-Woo', 'Park, Seung-Hyun', 'Kang, Seong-Kyu']","['Kim EA', 'Lee HE', 'Ryu HW', 'Park SH', 'Kang SK']","['Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110630,Korea (South),Saf Health Work,Safety and health at work,101542940,,,,2011/06/01 00:00,2011/06/01 00:01,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5491/SHAW.2011.2.2.122 [doi]', 'S2093-7911(11)22004-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Saf Health Work. 2011 Jun;2(2):122-34. doi: 10.5491/SHAW.2011.2.2.122.

METHODS: The research focused on 9 representative wafer fabrication bays among a total of 25 bays in a semiconductor product line. We monitored the chemical substances categorized as human carcinogens with respect to leukemia as well as harmful chemicals used in the bays and substances with hematologic and reproductive toxicities to evaluate the overall health effect for semiconductor industry workers. With respect to monitoring, active and passive sampling techniques were introduced. Eight-hour long-term and 15-minute short-term sampling was conducted for the area as well as on personal samples. RESULTS: The results of the measurements for each substance showed that benzene, toluene, xylene, n-butyl acetate, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-heptanone, ethylene glycol, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid were non-detectable (ND) in all samples. Arsine was either ""ND"" or it existed only in trace form in the bay air. The maximum exposure concentration of fluorides was approximately 0.17% of the Korea occupational exposure limits, with hydrofluoric acid at about 0.2%, hydrochloric acid 0.06%, nitric acid 0.05%, isopropyl alcohol 0.4%, and phosphine at about 2%. The maximum exposure concentration of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) was 0.0870 ppm, representing only 0.1% or less than the American Industrial Hygiene Association recommended standard (100 ppm). CONCLUSION: Benzene, a known human carcinogen for leukemia, and arsine, a hematologic toxin, were not detected in wafer fabrication sites in this study. Among reproductive toxic substances, n-butyl acetate was not detected, but fluorides and PGMEA existed in small amounts in the air. This investigation was focused on the air-borne chemical concentrations only in regular working conditions. Unconditional exposures during spills and/or maintenance tasks and by-product chemicals were not included.

METHODS: The cohort consisted of 8,866 male workers who had worked from the 1960s to 2007 at one refinery and six petrochemical companies located in a refinery/petrochemical complex in Korea that produce benzene or use benzene as a raw material. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for 1992-2007 and 1997-2005 based on the death rate and cancer incidence rate of the Korean male population according to job title (production, maintenance, laboratory, and office workers). RESULTS: The overall mortality and most cause-specific mortalities were lower among these workers than those of the general Korean population. Increased SMRs were observed for leukemia (4/1.45; SMR 2.77, 95% CI: 0.75-7.09) and lymphohematopoietic cancers (5/2.51; SMR 2, 95% CI: 0.65-4.66) in production workers, and increased SIRs were also observed in leukemia (3/1.34; SIR 2.24, 95% CI: 0.46-6.54) and lymphohematopoietic cancers (5/3.39; SIR 1.47, 95% CI: 0.48-3.44) in production workers, but the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results showed a potential relationship between leukemia and lymphohematopoietic cancers and exposure to benzene in refinery/petrochemical complex workers. This study yielded limited results due to a short observational period; therefore, a follow-up study must be performed to elucidate the relationship between petrochemical exposure and cancer rates.","['Koh, Dong-Hee', 'Kim, Tae-Woo', 'Yoon, Yong-Hoon', 'Shin, Kyung-Seok', 'Yoo, Seung-Won']","['Koh DH', 'Kim TW', 'Yoon YH', 'Shin KS', 'Yoo SW']","['Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110331,Korea (South),Saf Health Work,Safety and health at work,101542940,,,,2011/03/01 00:00,2011/03/01 00:01,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5491/SHAW.2011.2.1.26 [doi]', 'S2093-7911(11)21004-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Saf Health Work. 2011 Mar;2(1):26-33. doi: 10.5491/SHAW.2011.2.1.26.

The aim of this study is to provide an estimation of the population attributable fraction (PAF) of occupational cancer in Korea. METHODS: Nine kinds of Group 1 carcinogens addressed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and 7 kinds of cancer were selected for the target carcinogens and diseases, respectively. The prevalence of carcinogen-exposed workers was estimated and correction factors were applied so that the value would be representative of the total population. Data on relative risk (RR) were taken from IARC reports and were compared with the RRs from the studies on Korean workers. The PAF was estimated according to Levin's formula. RESULTS: The proportion of the general Korean population exposed to carcinogens was 9.7%. The PAF of total cancer was 1.1% for incident cancer cases and 1.7% for cancer deaths. The PAFs of lung cancer and leukemia were 7.0% and 4.%, respectively. With the RRs reported from Korean studies, the PAF for lung cancer and leukemia were 3.7% and 3.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PAF in this study (1.1%) was lower than that reported in previous studies (2-4%) from developed countries. Considering that only 9 of the 29 kinds of Group 1 carcinogens were included in this study, the PAF might be underestimated. However, because the process of industrialization in Korea differs from that which occurred in other developed countries, 1.1% of the PAF might be appropriate for Korea.","['Kim, Eun-A', 'Lee, Hye-Eun', 'Kang, Seong-Kyu']","['Kim EA', 'Lee HE', 'Kang SK']","['Center for Occupational Disease Research, Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, KOSHA, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100930,Korea (South),Saf Health Work,Safety and health at work,101542940,,,,2010/09/01 00:00,2010/09/01 00:01,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5491/SHAW.2010.1.1.61 [doi]', 'S2093-7911(10)11008-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Saf Health Work. 2010 Sep;1(1):61-8. doi: 10.5491/SHAW.2010.1.1.61.

Isospora belli was detected in her stool by modified acid-fast staining. Serologic testing was negative for HIV but positive for HTLV-1 infection. Treatment with TMP-SMZ led to improvement in her diarrhea which recurred after stopping antibiotics. Subsequently, she developed generalized lymphadenopathy which was diagnosed as ATLL on immunohistochemical staining. Chemotherapy was initiated, but her condition continued to worsen due to persistent diarrhea and resulting profound electrolyte abnormalities. The patient opted for comfort measures and died a few weeks later at a nursing facility. This case emphasizes that the detection of I. belli should trigger testing for HIV, HTLV-1, and other causes of immunocompromise.

In our paper, we present a 70-year-old Caucasian male who was diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis, and after 8 years of followup and therapy developed an AML. The small lymphoid aggregates noted in his bone marrow were neoplastic in nature and represented bone marrow involvement by a CD5-negative mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that presented without any associated lymphadenopathy. We reviewed the English medical literature to identify a single case report of simultaneous association of AML and a MCL in the bone marrow.

Here, we analyzed the proliferation index (PI) of different compartments of BM hematopoietic cells in 106 MDS patients compared to both normal/reactive BM (n = 94) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 30 cases) using multiparameter flow cytometry. Our results show abnormally increased overall BM proliferation profiles in MDS which significantly differ between early/low-risk and advanced/high-risk cases. Early/low-risk patients showed increased proliferation of non-lymphoid CD34(+) precursors, maturing neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells (NRBC), while the PI of these compartments of BM precursors progressively fell below normal values towards AML levels in advanced/high-risk MDS. Decreased proliferation of non-lymphoid CD34(+) and NRBC precursors was significantly associated with adverse disease features, shorter overall survival (OS) and transformation to AML, both in the whole series and when low- and high-risk MDS patients were separately considered, the PI of NRBC emerging as the most powerful independent predictor for OS and progression to AML. In conclusion, assessment of the PI of NRBC, and potentially also of other compartments of BM precursors (e.g.: myeloid CD34(+) HPC), could significantly contribute to a better management of MDS.","['Matarraz, Sergio', 'Teodosio, Cristina', 'Fernandez, Carlos', 'Albors, Manuel', 'Jara-Acevedo, Maria', 'Lopez, Antonio', 'Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Maria', 'Gutierrez, Maria Laura', 'Flores-Montero, Juan', 'Cervero, Carlos', 'Pizarro-Perea, Marlies', 'Paz Garrastazul, Maria', 'Caballero, Gonzalo', 'Gutierrez, Oliver', 'Mendez, Guy Daniel', 'Gonzalez-Silva, Manuel', 'Laranjeira, Paula', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Matarraz S', 'Teodosio C', 'Fernandez C', 'Albors M', 'Jara-Acevedo M', 'Lopez A', 'Gonzalez-Gonzalez M', 'Gutierrez ML', 'Flores-Montero J', 'Cervero C', 'Pizarro-Perea M', 'Paz Garrastazul M', 'Caballero G', 'Gutierrez O', 'Mendez GD', 'Gonzalez-Silva M', 'Laranjeira P', 'Orfao A']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (Instituto de Biologia Celular y Molecular del Cancer, CSIC-USAL), IBSAL, Servicio de Citometria and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/classification/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044321 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-15453 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e44321. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044321.

However, a clinical-relevant means of delivering siRNA molecules must be developed, as the cellular delivery of siRNA is problematic. Here, we report amphiphilic carriers combining a cationic polymer (2 kDa polyethyleneimine, PEI2) with lipophilic moieties to facilitate intracellular delivery of siRNA to AML cell lines. Complete binding of siRNA by the designed carriers was achieved at a polymer:siRNA ratio of approximately 0.5 and led to siRNA/polymer complexes of approximately 100 nm size. While the native PEI2 did not display cytotoxicity on AML cell lines THP-1, KG-1 and HL-60, lipid-modification on PEI2 slightly increased the cytotoxicity, which was consistent with increased interaction of polymers with cell membranes. Cellular delivery of siRNA was dependent on the nature of lipid substituent and the extent of lipid substitution, and varied among the three AML cell lines used. Linoleic acid-substituted polymers performed best among the prepared polymers and gave a siRNA delivery equivalent to better performing commercial reagents. Using THP-1 cells and a reporter (GFP) and an endogenous (CXCR4) target, effective silencing of the chosen targets was achieved with 25 to 50 nM of siRNA concentrations, and without adversely affecting subsequent cell growth. We conclude that lipid-substituted PEI2 can serve as an effective delivery of siRNA to leukemic cells and could be employed in molecular therapy of leukemia.","['Landry, Breanne', 'Aliabadi, Hamidreza Montazeri', 'Samuel, Anuja', 'Gul-Uludag, Hilal', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Kutsch, Olaf', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Landry B', 'Aliabadi HM', 'Samuel A', 'Gul-Uludag H', 'Jiang X', 'Kutsch O', 'Uludag H']","['Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Polyethyleneimine/*chemistry', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Serum/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Trypan Blue', 'Viruses/metabolism']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044197 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-09735 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e44197. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044197.

A dearth of experimental models has hampered the study of myeloid sarcomas and led us to establish a new system in which tumor induction can be evaluated in an easily accessible non-hematopoietic tissue compartment. Using ex-vivo transduction of oncogenic Kras(G12V) into p16/p19(-/-) bone marrow cells, we generated transplantable leukemia-initiating cells that rapidly induced tumor formation in the skeletal muscle of immunocompromised NOD.SCID mice. In this model, murine histiocytic sarcomas, equivalent to human myeloid sarcomas, emerged at the injection site 30-50 days after cell implantation and consisted of tightly packed monotypic cells that were CD48+, CD47+ and Mac1+, with low or absent expression of other hematopoietic lineage markers. Tumor cells also infiltrated the bone marrow, spleen and other non-hematopoietic organs of tumor-bearing animals, leading to systemic illness (leukemia) within two weeks of tumor detection. P16/p19(-/-); Kras(G12V) myeloid sarcomas were multi-clonal, with dominant clones selected during secondary transplantation. The systemic leukemic phenotypes exhibited by histiocytic sarcoma-bearing mice were nearly identical to those of animals in which leukemia was introduced by intravenous transplantation of the same donor cells. Moreover, murine histiocytic sarcoma could be similarly induced by intramuscular injection of MLL-AF9 leukemia cells. This study establishes a novel, transplantable model of murine histiocytic/myeloid sarcoma that recapitulates the natural progression of these malignancies to systemic disease and indicates a cell autonomous leukemogenic mechanism.","['Liu, Jianing', 'Hettmer, Simone', 'Milsom, Michael D', 'Hofmann, Inga', 'Hua, Frederic', 'Miller, Christine', 'Bronson, Roderick T', 'Wagers, Amy J']","['Liu J', 'Hettmer S', 'Milsom MD', 'Hofmann I', 'Hua F', 'Miller C', 'Bronson RT', 'Wagers AJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, and Joslin Diabetes Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/deficiency/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044044 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-14265 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e44044. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044044.

(2010) Cell Cycle 9: 4560-4568; Baek et al. (2012) J Am Chem Soc 134: 103-106). Affinity is also modulated by the ability of the staples to pre-organize the peptides as helices. Molecular dynamics simulations of these stapled BH3 peptides were carried out followed by determination of the energies of interactions using MM/GBSA methods. These show that the location of the staple is a key determinant of a good binding stapled peptide from a bad binder.

Stromal cells present in the tumor microenvironment express high levels of CXCL12 protein, directly stimulating proliferation and migration of CXCR4-expressing cancer cells. This specific prosurvival influence of stromal cells on tumor cells is thought to protect them from cytotoxic chemotherapy and is postulated as a possible explanation for the minimal residual disease in hematological and solid cancers. Therefore, CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in cancer, as proven in preclinical leukemia mouse models, where CXCR4 inhibition sensitized cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy. This study investigates whether inhibition of CXCR4 with the specific inhibitor AMD3100 sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel. We showed that both mouse and human stromal cell lines have a protective effect on PC3-luc cells by promoting their survival after chemotherapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AMD3100 sensitizes PC3-luc cells to docetaxel. In a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of human prostate carcinoma, we showed that a combination of docetaxel and AMD3100 exerts increased antitumor effect compared with docetaxel alone. We concluded that CXCR4 inhibition chemosensitizes prostate cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the relevance of these findings, we analyzed CXCR4 expression levels in human prostate cancer samples. We found that cancer cells present in bone metastatic lesions express higher CXCR4 levels relative to the cells present in primary tumors and lymph node metastatic lesions. These findings underscore the potential of CXCR4 inhibitors as chemosensitizing agents.","['Domanska, Urszula M', 'Timmer-Bosscha, Hetty', 'Nagengast, Wouter B', 'Oude Munnink, Thijs H', 'Kruizinga, Roeliene C', 'Ananias, Hildo J K', 'Kliphuis, Nathalie M', 'Huls, Gerwin', 'De Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'de Jong, Igle J', 'Walenkamp, Annemiek M E']","['Domanska UM', 'Timmer-Bosscha H', 'Nagengast WB', 'Oude Munnink TH', 'Kruizinga RC', 'Ananias HJ', 'Kliphuis NM', 'Huls G', 'De Vries EG', 'de Jong IJ', 'Walenkamp AM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Neoplasms/metabolism/secondary', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Docetaxel', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Taxoids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.12324 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2012 Aug;14(8):709-18. doi: 10.1593/neo.12324.,PMC3431178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOCS6 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 6) is a member of the SOCS family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that can regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction. In this study, we analyzed the role of SOCS6 in Flt3 signal transduction. The results show that ligand stimulation of Flt3 can induce association of SOCS6 and Flt3 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS6. Phosphopeptide fishing indicated that SOCS6 binds directly to phosphotyrosines 591 and 919 of Flt3. By using stably transfected Ba/F3 cells with Flt3 and/or SOCS6, we show that the presence of SOCS6 can enhance ubiquitination of Flt3, as well as internalization and degradation of the receptor. The presence of SOCS6 also induces weaker activation of Erk1/2, but not Akt, in transfected Ba/F3 and UT-7 cells and in OCI-AML-5 cells. The absence of SOCS6 promotes Ba/F3 and UT-7 cell proliferation induced by oncogenic internal tandem duplications of Flt3. Taken together, these results suggest that SOCS6 negatively regulates Flt3 activation, the downstream Erk signaling pathway, and cell proliferation.","['Kazi, Julhash U', 'Sun, Jianmin', 'Phung, Bengt', 'Zadjali, Fahad', 'Flores-Morales, Amilcar', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Kazi JU', 'Sun J', 'Phung B', 'Zadjali F', 'Flores-Morales A', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Wallenberg Laboratory, Skane University Hospital, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120905,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (SOCS6 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Protein Binding', '*Proteolysis', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/07 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62624-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.376111 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Oct 19;287(43):36509-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.376111.

A total of 146 consecutive adult patients (>15 years) were enrolled in the study. First, we determined the correct lineage assignment of the blast cells and evaluated the incidence of the favourable PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 genetic markers among the AML cases. Additionally, the obtained results were correlated with patients' age, comorbidities, and performance status, and each single AML patient was stratified to effective treatment strategy. Our results showed that morphology and cytochemistry established a lineage in 132 (89.1%) of the patients, but not in 16 cases that presented as acute leukaemia, of which 7 were assigned as myeloid, and in two a non-haematopoietic malignancy was indicated with immunophenotyping. Mulitparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping also changed the assigned lineage based on morphology and cytochemistry in 5 (3.3%) of the patients from lymphoid to myeloid and improved diagnosis in 21 (14.1%) cases. By using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) essay 28 (23.1%) patients were classified in the prognostically favourable AML genetic group; 8 patients expressed the fusion transcript PML/RARalpha AML1/ETO and 15 CBFbeta/MYH11. Moreover, analyses of the age, performance status and comorbidities further strtified an additional 12.5% of the patients to a different risk-adapted therapy. The applied minimal screening-analysis-based diagnostic algorithm enabled improved and more precise diagnosis and clinical stratification in 37.2 % of AML patients from our study group.","['Panovska-Stavridis, I', 'Trajkova, S', 'Ivanovski, M', 'Hadzi-Pecova, L', 'Dukovski, D', 'Popova-Simjanovska, M', 'Cevreska, L']","['Panovska-Stavridis I', 'Trajkova S', 'Ivanovski M', 'Hadzi-Pecova L', 'Dukovski D', 'Popova-Simjanovska M', 'Cevreska L']","['University Haematology Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, Ss.

The majority of these repeats are retrotransposons of the SINE and LINE families, and such repeats are generally repressed by epigenetic mechanisms. It has been proposed that these elements can act as methylation centers from which DNA methylation spreads into gene promoters in cancer. Contradictory to a methylation center function, we have found that retrotransposons are enriched near promoter CpG islands that stay methylation-free in cancer. Clearly, it is important to determine which influence, if any, these repetitive elements have on nearby gene promoters. Using an in vitro system, we confirm here that SINE B1 elements can influence the activity of downstream gene promoters, with acquisition of DNA methylation and loss of activating histone marks, thus resulting in a repressed state. SINE sequences themselves did not immediately acquire DNA methylation but were marked by H3K9me2 and H3K27me3. Moreover, our bisulfite sequencing data did not support that gain of DNA methylation in gene promoters occurred by methylation spreading from SINE B1 repeats. Genome-wide analysis of SINE repeats distribution showed that their enrichment is directly correlated with the presence of USF1, USF2, and CTCF binding, proteins with insulator function. In summary, our work supports the concept that SINE repeats interfere negatively with gene expression and that their presence near gene promoters is counter-selected, except when the promoter is protected by an insulator element.","['Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Gallegos, Juan', 'Dekmezian, Mhair', 'Lu, Yue', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Estecio MR', 'Gallegos J', 'Dekmezian M', 'Lu Y', 'Liang S', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. mestecio@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120904,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cdkn2d protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19)', '0 (Mlh1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Alu Elements/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*genetics', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulator Elements/genetics', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/genetics', 'Mice', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/*genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-12-0351 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0351 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2012 Oct;10(10):1332-42. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0351.

Such ATM mutations may be particularly relevant in the setting of del11q, which invariably results in the deletion of one ATM allele. To improve our understanding of the frequency and type of ATM mutations that exist in CLL, we resequenced all ATM coding exons in 24 CLL with del11q using direct sequencing. We detected two missense mutations, resulting in an ATM mutation frequency of 8%; nonsense and frameshift mutations were not identified. Given the low ATM mutation frequency detected in this cohort, we proceeded with measurements of nonmutational ATM aberrations in CLL through analysis of the activation state of ATM in response to external irradiation. The phosphorylation state of ATM at Ser-1981 was measured using quantitative immunoblotting in purified CLL cells isolated from 251 CLL patients; data were normalized to simultaneous measurements of total ATM protein and actin. Resulting p-ATM/ATM and p-ATM/actin ratios were subsequently analyzed for prognostic significance inclusive and exclusive of TP53 exons 2-10 mutations. From these analyses, conducted in a large prospectively enrolled CLL patient cohort, neither the p-ATM/ATM nor the p-ATM/actin ratios were found to be prognostic for short survival. These data in aggregate demonstrate a low frequency of ATM aberrations in an unselected CLL cohort and do not support a major prognostic role for ATM aberrations in CLL, thus motivating renewed research efforts aimed at understanding the pathobiology of 11q deletions in CLL.

Whereas, with the exception of the recent addition of CXCR4 antagonists to the armamentarium for mobilization of patients refractory to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone, clinical stem cell mobilization has not changed significantly over the last decade or so, much effort has been made trying to explain the complex mechanism(s) by which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells leave the marrow.

One of these new analogues, an amino sulfoximine 5 having no net charge at cellular pH, is a better hASNS inhibitor (K(I)( *)=8 nM) than 1 and suppresses proliferation of MOLT-4R cells at 10-fold lower concentration (IC(50)=0.1mM). More importantly, and in contrast to the lead compound 1, the presence of sulfoximine 5 at concentrations above 0.25 mM causes the death of MOLT-4R cells even when ASNase is absent in the culture medium. The amino sulfoximine 5 exhibits different dose-response behavior when incubated with an ASNase-sensitive MOLT-4 cell line (MOLT-4S), supporting the hypothesis that sulfoximine 5 exerts its effect by inhibiting hASNS in the cell.

We present a case of AML with recurrent acute limb ischemia and multiple organ infarctions. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 57-year-old woman diagnosed with AML subtype M1 developed recurrent bilateral acute lower-limb ischemia refractory to multiple thromboembolectomies and bypass grafting. Histopathology revealed that thrombi were composed of leukemic blasts, and computed tomography angiogram incidentally revealed multiple infarctions. She demonstrated a response to chemotherapy, but died of an overwhelming sepsis 22 days after her acute admission. CONCLUSIONS: AML subtype M1 with acute lower-limb ischemia and multiple organ infarctions is associated with a poor prognosis. The role of emergency chemotherapy in reducing the tumour burden and possibly improving the results of vascular interventions needs to be defined. Limb-salvaging surgery should not be delayed but be administered immediately according to the degree of ischemia.","['Overton, John', 'Nicklin, Angela', 'Eleftheriou, Perla', 'Frith, Daniel', 'Gravante, Gianpiero', 'Sapsford, Wayne']","['Overton J', 'Nicklin A', 'Eleftheriou P', 'Frith D', 'Gravante G', 'Sapsford W']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Barts and the London NHS Trust, London, UK. overtonjohn@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120828,Netherlands,Ann Vasc Surg,Annals of vascular surgery,8703941,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Embolectomy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infarction/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Ischemia/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/surgery', 'Kidney/*blood supply', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lower Extremity/*blood supply', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Sepsis/etiology', 'Splenic Infarction/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Thrombectomy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Vascular Grafting']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0890-5096(12)00223-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.avsg.2012.02.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Vasc Surg. 2012 Nov;26(8):1128.e1-5. doi: 10.1016/j.avsg.2012.02.020.

The present study provides an integration of pharmacokinetic and genetic data of 63 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) preconditioned for HSCT with high dose oral BU, with the aim of defining biomarkers predictive of poor BU metabolism. BU area under the concentration time curve (AUC) demonstrated that 76% of the patients achieved target AUC; 24% required dose modification. The main findings of this study were: (1) AML patients carrying the GSTP1 rs1695 variant allele were at risk of developing supra-therapeutic BU-AUC due to reduced BU clearance. (2) Combined polymorphisms in GSTM1 and ABCB1 were associated with BU clearance and AUC rates. In conclusion, GST and ABCB1 genotyping may assist care-givers in personalizing BU dosage with less trial-and-error and may enable preemptive identification of patients at risk for BU toxicity.","['Krivoy, Norberto', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Elkin, Hela', 'Froymovich, Lia', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Efrati, Edna']","['Krivoy N', 'Zuckerman T', 'Elkin H', 'Froymovich L', 'Rowe JM', 'Efrati E']","['Rappaport - Rambam Center for Translational Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Saf,Current drug safety,101270895,"['EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['CDS-EPUB-20120828-1 [pii]', '10.2174/157488612803251324 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Saf. 2012 Jul;7(3):211-7. doi: 10.2174/157488612803251324.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is evidenced by the two DNMT inhibitors (azacitidine and decitabine) approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and the first clinical data available in AML. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews data from the international literature regarding the design, sites of impact and pharmacodynamic characteristics of DNMT inhibitors, and their first clinical experiences in AML. EXPERT OPINION: The strongest advances in epigenetic therapy have been in the treatment of AML. There are now an increasing number of DNMT inhibitors. These agents may be potentially administered at different times of leukemia therapy: before or instead of chemotherapy, as maintenance therapy, prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) or after relapse following SCT.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"[""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Pierre Benite, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120905,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Epigenomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mutation']",2012/09/07 06:00,2013/03/22 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17460441.2012.722618 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2012 Nov;7(11):1039-51. doi: 10.1517/17460441.2012.722618.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the anticancer properties of one cucurbitacin isolated from Cayaponia racemosa Cong. (Cucurbitaceae), 2beta,3beta,16alpha,20(R),25-pentahydroxy-22-oxocucurbita-5-en (1), with in vitro and in vivo models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro cytotoxic activity was determined with human leukemia (HL60) and normal blood cells (PBMC). Sarcoma 180 was used as in vivo model. RESULTS: The cucurbitacin (1) reduced the number of viable cells; however, there was no changed in the number of non-viable cells at 5 microg/mL. Selectivity towards cancer cells was suggested by the absence of activity on normal proliferating lymphocytes at the concentrations tested (IC(5)(0) >25 microg/ml). Morphological analysis of compound 1-treated cells showed typical apoptotic features, such as intense deposition of granules in the cytoplasm (eosinophilia), DNA fragmentation and irregularities in the plasma membrane. In addition, the cells treated with compound 1 presented intense vacuolization and disruption of the plasma membrane. Acridine orange/Ethidium bromide staining confirmed these findings, revealing an increased number of apoptotic cells. In the Sarcoma 180 tumor model, compound 1 showed 52 and 62% of antitumor activity, either alone (25 mg/kg/day) or in association with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU (10 + 10 mg/kg/day), respectively. Moreover, either alone or associated with 5-FU, treatment with compound 1 caused an increase in spleen weight and morphological alterations related to immunostimulatory properties. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that these naturally occurring compounds have anticancer potential.","['Militao, Gardenia C G', 'Dantas, Ivana N F', 'Ferreira, Paulo Michel P', 'Alves, Ana Paula N N', 'Chaves, Davina C', 'Monte, Francisco Jose Q', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'Odorico de Moraes, Manoel', 'Costa-Lotufo, Leticia V']","['Militao GC', 'Dantas IN', 'Ferreira PM', 'Alves AP', 'Chaves DC', 'Monte FJ', 'Pessoa C', 'Odorico de Moraes M', 'Costa-Lotufo LV']","['Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Rua prof.

Although its precise mechanism of action is as yet unknown, it appears to exert its antineoplastic effects via a different mechanism to those of other alkylating agents. This article reviews the utilization of intravenous bendamustine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), rituximab-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), focusing on indications for which the agent is approved in the EU. As monotherapy, bendamustine was effective in the first-line treatment of adults with CLL, significantly prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) and improving the overall response (OR) rate after a median duration of follow-up of 35 months compared with chlorambucil in a randomized, open-label, multinational, phase III study. PFS and the OR rate were at least 2-fold greater with bendamustine than with chlorambucil when data from the overall patient population were stratified by Binet stage. In the treatment of adults with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL, monotherapy with bendamustine was efficacious, with an OR achieved by at least three-quarters of patients in two noncomparative multicentre studies. Patients with follicular histology or those who had responded or were refractory to their previous chemotherapy regimen (including alkylator therapy) also appeared to respond to bendamustine monotherapy. Front-line combination therapy with bendamustine plus prednisone was significantly more effective than combination therapy with melphalan plus prednisone in prolonging the time to treatment failure, according to a randomized, open-label multicentre, phase III study in adults with MM. Moreover, the benefits of bendamustine plus prednisone appeared to be maintained beyond 30 months, with a retrospective calculation of PFS demonstrating a borderline statistical significance in favour of bendamustine plus prednisone over melphalan plus prednisone. The tolerability profile of bendamustine in adults with CLL, indolent NHL or MM was mostly consistent with the known toxicities of the agent, with adverse events often managed with dose modifications. Although further data are required to fully establish the comparative efficacy of intravenous bendamustine in the management of CLL, rituximab-refractory indolent NHL or MM, it appears to be a useful addition to the armamentarium of currently available therapies for these haematological malignancies.","['Hoy, Sheridan M']",['Hoy SM'],"['Adis, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@springer.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/09/07 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['4 [pii]', '10.2165/11209510-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2012 Oct 1;72(14):1929-50. doi: 10.2165/11209510-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 6 cases from 5 males and one female (median age, 48.6 yrs). All presented with non-specific symptoms or an incidentally discovered tumor mass. Two patients had a remote history of chemotherapy for hematological neoplasms (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma respectively) and another had clear cell renal cell carcinoma and anaplastic pancreatic carcinoma diagnosed at autopsy without definable syndrome. None of the patients had evidence of the tuberous sclerosis complex or renal or other extra-renal angiomyolipoma. Three tumors were resected completely and three have been only biopsied and followed up. None of the resected cases recurred at a mean follow-up of 35 months. Histologically, tumors were classified as classical triphasic (1), lipomatous (2), epithelioid/oncocytoid (1), epithelioid trabecular (1) and myelolipoma-like (1). The adjacent liver parenchyma was normal in 3 cases, showed pigment cirrhosis in one case and mild fatty change in another case. One case had clinically diagnosed but histologically unverified cirrhosis. The initial diagnostic impression/frozen section was misleading in 5 of the cases and included vascular lesion, focal fatty change, myelolipoma, hepatocellular tumor and oncocytic neoplasm. All tumors expressed HMB45 and variably desmin. One epithelioid lesion expressed HMB45 and TFE3, but lacked desmin expression. In conclusion, hepatic angiomyolipomas are increasingly recognized as incidental findings during surveillance for cirrhosis or investigations for unrelated conditions. Awareness of their diverse morphological spectrum in liver biopsy is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis as hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic melanoma or other malignant neoplasms.","['Agaimy, Abbas', 'Vassos, Nikolaos', 'Croner, Roland S', 'Strobel, Deike', 'Lell, Michael']","['Agaimy A', 'Vassos N', 'Croner RS', 'Strobel D', 'Lell M']","['Institute of pathology, University Hospital, Erlangen, Germany. abbas.agaimy@uk-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120729,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,IM,"['Adenoma, Oxyphilic/diagnosis', 'Adult', 'Angiomyolipoma/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/surgery', 'Biopsy, Large-Core Needle', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors/prevention & control', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Fatty Liver/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Liver Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelolipoma/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Radiography', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/06 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2012;5(6):512-21.

Increased exposure to cyclophosphamide metabolites has been associated with treatment-related toxicity. The effect of obesity on exposure to cyclophosphamide-induced G-NOR-G crosslinks is not known. Therefore we sought to determine whether obesity affects the formation of cyclophosphamide-specific G-NOR-G crosslinks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma cyclophosphamide concentrations and blood cell G-NOR-G amounts were measured. RESULTS: Overweight/obese patients received a significantly higher daily cyclophosphamide dose (median 3000 vs. 4450 mg, p<0.01). Despite the higher doses, overweight/obese patients had lower exposure to cyclophosphamide compared to lean patients with an area under the curve (AUC(0-infinity)) =529.24 vs. 867.99 mucg/ml*h respectively, p<0.01. G-NOR-G amounts were similar in overweight/obese and lean subjects, AUC(0-infinity)=142.8 vs. 147.0 adducts/10(6) nucleotides*h, respectively, p=0.59. CONCLUSION: Overweight/obese patients have altered metabolism and disposition of cyclophosphamide.

AIMS: To examine cancer incidence among a cohort of UK electricity generation and transmission workers. METHODS: Cancer morbidity experienced by a cohort of 81 842 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales was investigated for the period 1973-2008. All employees had worked for at least 6 months with some employment between 1973 and 1982. Standardized registration ratios (SRRs) were calculated on the basis of national rates. RESULTS: Overall cancer morbidity was slightly below expectation in males and females. Significant excesses were found in male workers for mesothelioma (Observed [Obs] 504, SRR 331), skin cancer (non-melanoma) (Obs 3187, SRR 107) and prostate cancer (Obs 2684, SRR 107) and in female workers for cancer of the small intestine (Obs 10, SRR 306) and nasal cancer (Obs 9, SRR 474). Brain cancers were close to expectation in males and below expectation in females. Leukaemia incidence (all types) was slightly below expectation in males and females. More detailed analyses showed import ant contrasts for mesothelioma and leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The clear occupational excess of mesothelioma was not matched by a corresponding excess of lung cancer, and the level of asbestos-induced lung cancer in this industry must be low. Leukaemia risks declined with period from hire; confident interpretation of this finding is not possible. The excesses of cancers of the nasal cavities and small intestine are probably not occupational, though the excess of skin cancer may be due to outdoor work.","['Sorahan, T']",['Sorahan T'],"['Institute of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

The phase III Bosutinib Efficacy and Safety in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (BELA) trial compared bosutinib with imatinib in newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 502 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to bosutinib 500 mg per day or imatinib 400 mg per day. RESULTS: The complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate at 12 months was not different for bosutinib (70%; 95% CI, 64% to 76%) versus imatinib (68%; 95% CI, 62% to 74%; two-sided P = .601); therefore, the study did not achieve its primary end point. The major molecular response (MMR) rate at 12 months was higher with bosutinib (41%; 95% CI, 35% to 47%) compared with imatinib (27%; 95% CI, 22% to 33%; two-sided P < .001). Time to CCyR and MMR was faster with bosutinib compared with imatinib (two-sided P < .001 for both). On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in four patients (2%) on bosutinib compared with 10 patients (4%) on imatinib. A total of three CML-related deaths occurred on the bosutinib arm compared with eight on the imatinib arm. The safety profiles of bosutinib and imatinib were distinct; GI and liver-related events were more frequent with bosutinib, whereas neutropenia, musculoskeletal disorders, and edema were more frequent with imatinib. CONCLUSION: This ongoing trial did not meet its primary end point of CCyR at 12 months, despite the observed higher MMR rate at 12 months, faster times to CCyR and MMR, fewer on-treatment transformations to accelerated/blast phase, and fewer CML-related deaths with bosutinib compared with imatinib.

Allogeneic HSCT reduces relapse, but nonrelapse mortality and morbidity might counterbalance this beneficial effect. Here, we review recent studies reporting new disease-specific prognostic markers, in addition to allogeneic-HSCT-related risk factors, which can be assessed at specific time points during treatment. We propose risk assessment as a dynamic process during treatment, incorporating both disease-related and transplant-related factors for the decision to proceed either to allogeneic HSCT or to apply a nontransplant strategy. We suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be favoured if the projected disease-free survival is expected to improve by at least 10% based on an individual's risk assessment. The approach requires initial disease risk assessment, identifying a sibling or unrelated donor soon after diagnosis and the incorporation of time-dependent risk factors, all within the context of an integrated therapeutic management approach.","['Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J']","['Cornelissen JJ', 'Gratwohl A', 'Schlenk RF', 'Sierra J', 'Bornhauser M', 'Juliusson G', 'Racil Z', 'Rowe JM', 'Russell N', 'Mohty M', 'Lowenberg B', 'Socie G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Groene Hilledijk 301, 3075 EA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.cornelissen@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120904,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

METHODS: Cancer incidence data for the years 2002-2008 were obtained from the population-based cancer registry Bavaria according to sex. Current U content data of public drinking water on the level of municipalities were obtained from a publicly available source. The possible association between drinking water U content and cancer risk adjusted for average socio-economic status was evaluated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Drinking water U content was below 20 mug/L in 458 out of 461 included municipalities. We found a significantly increased risk of leukemia in men in the intermediate (U level, 1.00-4.99 mug/L; relative risk [RR], 1.14) and in the highest U exposure category (U level, >/=5 mug/L; RR, 1.28). Moreover, in women, a significantly elevated risk was identified with respect to kidney cancer in the highest exposure category (RR, 1.16) and with respect to lung cancer in the intermediate exposure category (RR, 1.12). CONCLUSION: The slightly increased risk of leukemia in men, kidney cancer in women, and lung cancer in women may require further investigation. If an increased cancer risk is confirmed, preventive measures (e.g., introduction of U filters in public water systems) may be considered.","['Radespiel-Troger, M', 'Meyer, M']","['Radespiel-Troger M', 'Meyer M']","['Population-based cancer registry Bavaria, Registration office, Ostliche Stadtmauerstr. 30, 91054, Erlangen, Germany, Martin.Radespiel-Troeger@ekr.med.uni-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120906,Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,"['0 (Drinking Water)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Drinking Water/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Uranium/*analysis/toxicity', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Water Supply']",2012/09/06 06:00,2014/05/17 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00420-012-0806-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2013 Oct;86(7):767-76. doi: 10.1007/s00420-012-0806-0.

A randomized comparison in trial CoALL 07-03.,254-7,10.1002/pbc.24273 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The anthracyclines daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (DOX) are among the most important drugs in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however there are conflicting in vitro data about the comparative efficacy and equivalent doses of both anthracyclines. To address the question of in vivo efficacy of both anthracyclines, patients enrolled in the CoALL 07-03 trial were randomized to receive one single dose of either doxorubicin 30 mg/m(2) , daunorubicin 30 mg/m(2) , or daunorubicin 40 mg/m(2) upfront induction therapy. PROCEDURE: Children with newly diagnosed B-Precursor ALL or T-ALL were eligible for the randomized comparison. From the percentage of blasts and the white blood cell count (WBC) the absolute number of leukemic cells per microl peripheral blood (PB) was calculated and the initial value before DOX/DNR infusion equated as 100%. Main target criterion of this study was the leukemic cell decrease from Day 0 to Day 7. RESULTS: Seven hundred forty three patients were randomized: 247 to the DOX; 252 to the DNR 30 mg/m(2) ; and DNR to the 40 mg/m(2) arm.

Anthracyclines are widely used to treat these leukemias, but dosing is limited by cardiotoxicity. Data support the efficacy of dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant in children; however, dexrazoxane use in children is not universally accepted due to concerns about toxicity, impact on the antitumor effect of anthracyclines, and risk of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN). PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to describe patterns of dexrazoxane use in pediatric patients with ALL or AML using the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients identified as having de novo ALL and AML at these PHIS hospitals were included. RESULTS: Of 8,733 patients with ALL and 2,556 with AML, 207 (2.4%) and 52 (2.0%) received dexrazoxane, respectively. Dexrazoxane use was greater in older children with ALL and AML and in black patients and males with ALL. Dexrazoxane use varied across time and by region in ALL, but not in AML. Prescribing practices differed across institutions and most patients received the first dose early or late after the start of leukemia treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Dexrazoxane administration is limited in patients with ALL and AML and prescribing practices vary across the country. Further work is necessary to understand how dexrazoxane is used in patients at highest risk of developing cardiotoxicity and to define its true effect on the development of SMNs.","['Walker, Dana M', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Torp, Kari', 'Li, Yimei', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Walker DM', 'Fisher BT', 'Seif AE', 'Huang YS', 'Torp K', 'Li Y', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. sepe@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120904,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Razoxane/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/06 06:00,2013/04/19 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24270 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Apr;60(4):616-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24270.

Here, the role of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), a regulator for 'emergency granulopoiesis,' in the pathogenesis of CP-CML was examined. C/EBPbeta expression was upregulated in Lineage(-) CD34(+) CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors isolated from bone marrow of patients with CP-CML. In EML cells, a mouse HSC line, BCR-ABL upregulated C/EBPbeta, at least in part, through the activation of STAT5. Myeloid differentiation and proliferation induced by BCR-ABL was significantly impaired in C/EBPbeta-deficient bone marrow cells in vitro. Mice that were transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced C/EBPbeta knockout bone marrow cells survived longer than mice that received BCR-ABL-transduced wild-type (WT) bone marrow cells. Significantly higher levels of leukemic stem cells were maintained in BCR-ABL-transduced C/EBPbeta-deficient cells than in BCR-ABL-transduced WT cells. These results suggest that C/EBPbeta is involved in BCR-ABL-mediated myeloid expansion. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the C/EBPbeta-mediated stem cell loss might reveal a novel therapeutic strategy for eradication of CML stem cells.","['Hayashi, Y', 'Hirai, H', 'Kamio, N', 'Yao, H', 'Yoshioka, S', 'Miura, Y', 'Ashihara, E', 'Fujiyama, Y', 'Tenen, D G', 'Maekawa, T']","['Hayashi Y', 'Hirai H', 'Kamio N', 'Yao H', 'Yoshioka S', 'Miura Y', 'Ashihara E', 'Fujiyama Y', 'Tenen DG', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120905,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology']",2012/09/06 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012258 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.258 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):619-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.258.

APL can be associated with life-threatening bleeding complications when undiagnosed and not treated expeditiously. The PML-RARA fusion protein arrests maturation of myeloid cells at the promyelocytic stage, leading to the accumulation of neoplastic promyelocytes. Complete remission can be obtained by treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in combination with chemotherapy. Diagnosis of APL is based on the detection of t(15;17) by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization or PCR. These techniques are laborious and demand specialized laboratories. We developed a fast (performed within 4-5 h) and sensitive (detection of at least 10% malignant cells in normal background) flow cytometric immunobead assay for the detection of PML-RARA fusion proteins in cell lysates using a bead-bound anti-RARA capture antibody and a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-PML detection antibody. Testing of 163 newly diagnosed patients (including 46 APL cases) with the PML-RARA immunobead assay showed full concordance with the PML-RARA PCR results. As the applied antibodies recognize outer domains of the fusion protein, the assay appeared to work independently of the PML gene break point region.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the expression and function of HIF-1alpha in human leukemia bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and to identify the downstream targets of HIF-1alpha. HIF-1alpha expression was detected at both the RNA and protein levels using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) were detected in stromal cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIF-1alpha was blocked by constructing the lentiviral RNAi vector system and infecting the BMSCs. The Jurkat cell/BMSC co-cultured system was constructed by putting the two cells into the same suitable cultured media and conditions. Cell adhesion and secretion functions of stromal cells were evaluated after transfection with the lentiviral RNAi vector of HIF-1alpha. Increased HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein was detected in the nucleus of the acute myeloblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with normal BMSCs. The lentiviral RANi vector for HIF-1alpha was successfully constructed and was applied to block the expression of HIF-1alpha. When HIF-1alpha of BMSCs was blocked, the expression of VEGF and SDF-1 secreted by stromal cells were decreased. When HIF-1alpha was blocked, the co-cultured Jurkat cell's adhesion and migration functions were also decreased. Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1alpha acts as an important transcription factor and can significantly affect the secretion and adhesion functions of leukemia BMSCs.","['Dong-Feng, Zeng', 'Ting, Liu', 'Cheng, Chang', 'Xi, Zhang', 'Xue, Liang', 'Xing-Hua, Chen', 'Pei-Yan, Kong']","['Dong-Feng Z', 'Ting L', 'Cheng C', 'Xi Z', 'Xue L', 'Xing-Hua C', 'Pei-Yan K']","['Department of Hematology, XinQiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, ChongQing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/09/06 06:00,2014/07/14 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2012001000004 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2012007500107 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2012 Oct;45(10):906-12. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2012007500107.,PMC3854177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies show that HEXIM1 interacts with two key p53 regulators, nucleophosmin and human double minute-2 protein (HDM2), implying a possible connection between HEXIM1 and the p53 signaling pathway. Here we report the interaction between p53 and HEXIM1 in breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and colorectal carcinoma cells. The C-terminal regions of p53 and HEXIM1 are required for the protein-protein interaction. Overexpression of HEXIM1 prevents the ubiquitination of p53 by HDM2 and enhances the protein stability of p53, resulting in up-regulation of p53 target genes, such as Puma and p21. Induction of p53 can be achieved by several means, such as UV radiation and treatment with anti-cancer agents (including doxorubicin, etoposide, roscovitine, flavopiridol, and nutlin-3). Under all the conditions examined, elevated protein levels of p53 are found to associate with the increased p53-HEXIM1 interaction. In addition, knockdown of HEXIM1 significantly inhibits the induction of p53 and releases the cell cycle arrest caused by p53. Finally, the transcription of the p53 target genes is regulated by HEXIM1 in a p53-dependent fashion. Our results not only identify HEXIM1 as a positive regulator of p53, but also propose a novel molecular mechanism of p53 activation caused by the anti-cancer drugs and compounds.","['Lew, Qiao Jing', 'Chia, Yi Ling', 'Chu, Kai Ling', 'Lam, Yuen Ting', 'Gurumurthy, Meera', 'Xu, Shengli', 'Lam, Kong Peng', 'Cheong, Nge', 'Chao, Sheng-Hao']","['Lew QJ', 'Chia YL', 'Chu KL', 'Lam YT', 'Gurumurthy M', 'Xu S', 'Lam KP', 'Cheong N', 'Chao SH']","['Expression Engineering Group, Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR), Singapore 138668, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120904,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (HEXIM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects']",2012/09/06 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62618-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.374157 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Oct 19;287(43):36443-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.374157.

However, molecular characterization and evaluation of the extent of recombinase involvement at the TCR-oncogene junction has not been fully evaluated. In the present study, screening for TCRbeta and TCRalpha/delta translocations by FISH and ligation-mediated PCR in 280 T-ALLs allowed the identification of 4 previously unreported TCR-translocated oncogene partners: GNAG, LEF1, NKX2-4, and IL2RB. Molecular mapping of genomic junctions from TCR translocations showed that the majority of oncogenic partner breakpoints are not recombinase mediated and that the regulatory elements predominantly used to drive oncogene expression differ markedly in TCRbeta (which are exclusively enhancer driven) and TCRalpha/delta (which use an enhancer-independent cryptic internal promoter) translocations. Our data also imply that oncogene activation takes place at a very immature stage of thymic development, when Ddelta2-Ddelta3/Ddelta3-Jdelta1 and Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements occur, whereas the bulk leukemic maturation arrest occurs at a much later (cortical) stage. These observations have implications for T-ALL therapy, because the preleukemic early thymic clonogenic population needs to be eradicated and its disappearance monitored.","['Le Noir, Sandrine', 'Ben Abdelali, Raouf', 'Lelorch, Marc', 'Bergeron, Julie', 'Sungalee, Stephanie', 'Payet-Bornet, Dominique', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Callens, Celine', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Baranger, Laurence', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Gregoire, Marie-Jose', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Romana, Serge', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Nadel, Bertrand', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Asnafi, Vahid']","['Le Noir S', 'Ben Abdelali R', 'Lelorch M', 'Bergeron J', 'Sungalee S', 'Payet-Bornet D', 'Villarese P', 'Petit A', 'Callens C', 'Lhermitte L', 'Baranger L', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Gregoire MJ', 'Dombret H', 'Ifrah N', 'Spicuglia S', 'Romana S', 'Soulier J', 'Nadel B', 'Macintyre E', 'Asnafi V']","['Universite Paris Descartes, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120904,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/06 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46278-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-425488 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 18;120(16):3298-309. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-425488.

We investigate the role of macromolecular crowding in the formation and maintenance of NBs using computer simulations of a simple spherical model, called Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles. LJ particles form a one-phase, dilute fluid when the intermolecular interaction is weaker than a critical value, above which they phase separate and form a condensed domain. We find that when volume-exclusive crowders exist in significant concentrations, domain formation is induced even for weaker intermolecular interactions, and the effect is more pronounced with increasing crowder concentration. Simulation results show that a previous experimental finding that promyelocytic leukemia bodies disappear in the less-crowded condition and reassemble in the normal crowded condition can be interpreted as a consequence of the increased intermolecular interactions between NB proteins due to crowding. Based on further analysis of the simulation results, we discuss the acceleration of macromolecular associations that occur within NBs, and the delay of diffusive transport of macromolecules within and out of NBs when the crowder concentration increases. This study suggests that in a polydisperse nuclear environment that is enriched with a variety of macromolecules, macromolecular crowding not only plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of NBs, but also may perform some regulatory functions in response to alterations in the crowding conditions.","['Cho, Eun Jin', 'Kim, Jun Soo']","['Cho EJ', 'Kim JS']","['Department of Chemistry and Applied Chemistry, Hanyang University, Kyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry and Nano Science, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

In this article, we study the expression profile of genes involved in the regulation and protection of telomere length, telomerase activity and apoptosis in samples from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smouldering multiple myeloma, multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukaemia (PCL), as well as several human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). Using conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies, we identified a high number of telomeric associations (TAs). Moreover, telomere length measurements by terminal restriction fragment (TRF) assay showed a shorter mean TRF peak value, with a consistent correlation with the number of TAs. Using gene expression arrays and quantitative PCR we identified the hTERT gene together with 16 other genes directly involved in telomere length maintenance: HSPA9, KRAS, RB1, members of the Small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins family, A/B subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and 14-3-3 family. The expression levels of these genes were even higher than those in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which have unlimited proliferation capacity. In conclusion, the gene signature suggests that MM tumour cells are able to maintain stable short telomere lengths without exceeding the short critical length, allowing cell divisions to continue. We propose that this could be a mechanism contributing to MM tumour cells expansion in the bone marrow (BM).","['Diaz de la Guardia, Rafael', 'Catalina, Purificacion', 'Panero, Julieta', 'Elosua, Carolina', 'Pulgarin, Andres', 'Lopez, Maria Belen', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Ligero, Gertrudis', 'Slavutsky, Irma', 'Leone, Paola E']","['Diaz de la Guardia R', 'Catalina P', 'Panero J', 'Elosua C', 'Pulgarin A', 'Lopez MB', 'Ayllon V', 'Ligero G', 'Slavutsky I', 'Leone PE']","['Andalusian Public Health System Biobank, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica, Consejeria de Salud-Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain. rafael.diazguardia@juntadeandalucia.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA9 protein, human)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nucleolar)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nucleolar/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/06 06:00,2014/02/12 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01628.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2012 Dec;16(12):3009-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01628.x.,PMC4393729,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2012', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is an important cytokine associated with many inflammation-related diseases. We have previously demonstrated that TNFalpha induces PML protein accumulation. We hypothesized that PML may play a role in TNFalpha signaling pathway. To identify potential PML target genes and investigate the putative crosstalk between PML's function and TNFalpha signaling in endothelial cells, we carried out a microarray analysis in human primary umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). RESULTS: We found that PML and TNFalpha regulate common and distinct genes involved in a similar spectrum of biological processes, pathways and human diseases. More importantly, we found that PML is required for fine-tuning of TNFalpha-mediated immune and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our data suggest that PML and TNFalpha synergistically regulate cell adhesion by engaging multiple molecular mechanisms. Our biological functional assays exemplified that adhesion of U937 human leukocytes to HUVECs is co-regulated by PML and TNFalpha signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our study identified PML as an essential regulator of TNFalpha signaling by revealing the crosstalk between PML knockdown-mediated effects and TNFalpha-elicited signaling, thereby providing novel insights into TNFalpha signaling in endothelial cells.","['Cheng, Xiwen', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Cheng X', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the Comprehensive Cancer Center of CWRU and University Hospital of Cleveland (UHC), Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120904,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2012/09/06 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-13-453 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-13-453 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2012 Sep 4;13:453. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-453.,PMC3542097,"['R01 DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093269/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypersensitivity reactions limit the use and efficacy of asparaginase products. However, Erwinia asparaginase gained the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in November 2011, for use in patients with allergic reactions to Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase. AREAS COVERED: Erwinia asparaginase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the amino acid asparagine. This review examines the properties of Erwinia asparaginase compared to the two other preparations of asparaginase available for use in the United States. Results of selected clinical trials involving Erwinia asparaginase, including the pivotal study resulting in FDA approval, are presented. EXPERT OPINION: Erwinia asparaginase is well tolerated, and it is effective in achieving asparaginase levels associated with efficacy in the treatment of ALL. With FDA approval of Erwinia asparagainse, oncologists now have an alternative for ALL patients who become hypersensitive to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Future studies will be needed to establish optimal dosing of Erwinia asparaginase (e.g., intravenous vs. intramuscular) and to better define the most appropriate indications for its use in patients previously treated with E. coli-derived asparaginase.","['Salzer, Wanda', 'Seibel, Nita', 'Smith, Malcolm']","['Salzer W', 'Seibel N', 'Smith M']","['NCI, Bethesda, USA. wanda.salzer@us.army.mil']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120904,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Erwinia/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2012/09/06 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/09/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2012.718327 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2012 Oct;12(10):1407-14. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2012.718327.

Moreover, the existence of subclonal genetic and functional diversity in some human cancers such as leukemia underscores the importance of defining tumor surveillance mechanisms that effectively target the disease-sustaining cancer stem cells in addition to bulk cells. In this study, we report that leukemia stem cell function in xenotransplant models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depends on SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of macrophages through engagement with its ligand CD47. We generated mice expressing SIRPalpha variants with differential ability to bind human CD47 and demonstrated that macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and clearance of AML stem cells depend on absent SIRPalpha signaling. We obtained independent confirmation of the genetic restriction observed in our mouse models by using SIRPalpha-Fc fusion protein to disrupt SIRPalpha-CD47 engagement. Treatment with SIRPalpha-Fc enhanced phagocytosis of AML cells by both mouse and human macrophages and impaired leukemic engraftment in mice. Importantly, SIRPalpha-Fc treatment did not significantly enhance phagocytosis of normal hematopoietic targets. These findings support the development of therapeutics that antagonize SIRPalpha signaling to enhance macrophage-mediated elimination of AML.","['Theocharides, Alexandre P A', 'Jin, Liqing', 'Cheng, Po-Yan', 'Prasolava, Tatiana K', 'Malko, Andrei V', 'Ho, Jenny M', 'Poeppl, Armando G', 'van Rooijen, Nico', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Danska, Jayne S', 'Dick, John E', 'Wang, Jean C Y']","['Theocharides AP', 'Jin L', 'Cheng PY', 'Prasolava TK', 'Malko AV', 'Ho JM', 'Poeppl AG', 'van Rooijen N', 'Minden MD', 'Danska JS', 'Dick JE', 'Wang JC']","['The Campbell Family Cancer Research Institute, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120903,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIRPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'CD47 Antigen/metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Macrophages/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/05 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20120502 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20120502 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2012 Sep 24;209(10):1883-99. doi: 10.1084/jem.20120502.

In this multicenter study, we prospectively evaluated cognitive functioning and its medical and demographic correlates in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: A total of 102 patients were consecutively assessed prior to (T0 ), 100 +/- 20 days (T1 ) after, and 12 +/- 1 months (T2 ) after HSCT (61% men, 41% acute myeloid leukemia). A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was applied to evaluate attention, memory, executive function, and fine motor function, summing up into 14 test scores. RESULTS: Before and after HSCT, patients performed below test norms in up to 50% of the test scores. Patients were mostly impaired on word fluency (24%, T0 ), fine motor function, and verbal delayed recall (19% each, T2 ). Impairment on >/= 1/5 cognitive domains occurred in 47% (T0 ) and 41% (T2 ) of the patients. Performance (mean z-scores) partially improved over time (i.e., visual span forward, verbal learning, and word fluency). However, from baseline to T2 , 16% of the patients showed reliable decline on >/= 3/14 test scores (reliable change index method). For the majority of neuropsychological subtests, no associations with conditioning intensity, total body irradiation, graft-versus-host disease, cyclosporine treatment, and length of hospital stay were found. Age and premorbid intelligence level were consistently associated with cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Below average cognitive performance is common in this patient group. In addition, a subgroup shows reliable cognitive decline after allogeneic HSCT. Healthcare professionals should be aware of these treatment-related cognitive side effects.","['Scherwath, Angela', 'Schirmer, Lena', 'Kruse, Margitta', 'Ernst, Gundula', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Dinkel, Andreas', 'Kunze, Sabine', 'Balck, Friedrich', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Dolan, Karin', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Heussner, Pia', 'Wilhelm, Hans', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Schulz-Kindermann, Frank', 'Zander, Axel R', 'Koch, Uwe', 'Mehnert, Anja']","['Scherwath A', 'Schirmer L', 'Kruse M', 'Ernst G', 'Eder M', 'Dinkel A', 'Kunze S', 'Balck F', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Dolan K', 'Gramatzki M', 'Kolb HJ', 'Heussner P', 'Wilhelm H', 'Beelen DW', 'Schulz-Kindermann F', 'Zander AR', 'Koch U', 'Mehnert A']","['Department and Outpatient Clinic of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120904,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attention/physiology', '*Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology/psychology', 'Executive Function/physiology', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Memory/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychomotor Performance/physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/09/05 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3159 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Jul;22(7):1509-16. doi: 10.1002/pon.3159.

We evaluated whether 6-color FCM, including additional markers and new marker combinations, improved the results. Bone marrow samples were obtained from 363 ALL patients at day 15, 33 and 78 and MRD was analyzed using 6-color (218 patients) or 4-color (145 patients) FCM in parallel to routine PCR-based MRD diagnostics. Compared with 4-color FCM, 6-color FCM significantly improved the concordance with PCR-based MRD data (88% versus 96%); particularly the specificity of the MRD analysis improved. However, PCR remained more sensitive at levels <0.01%. MRD-based risk groups were similar between 6-color FCM and PCR in 68% of patients, most discrepancies being medium risk by PCR and standard risk by FCM. Alternative interpretation of the PCR data, aimed at prevention of false-positive MRD results, changed the risk group to standard risk in half (52%) of these discordant cases.

We investigated whether serum TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels have any impact on clinical outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels were determined in the serum of 160 CLL patients at the time of diagnosis. The cytokine low-risk group consisted of patients with either TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels below their medians or those with only one elevated parameter. Both TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels greater than or equal to their medians defined the cytokine high-risk group. The high-risk patients presented a shorter 3-year treatment-free survival (TFS) than low-risk subjects (15 vs. 69.6 %; p < 0.0001). The high-risk group (p = 0.0002) along with high leukocyte count (p < 0.0001) and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes (p < 0.0001) independently predict the risk of progression in patients with Rai stage 0-II. Furthermore, the high-risk group had an independent prognostic impact on shorter TFS both in patients with mutated (24.3 vs. 78.2 %; p < 0.0001) and unmutated (8.2 vs. 49 %; p = 0.004) immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes (IGHV) as compared to the low-risk group. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) of high-risk patients was shorter than those in the low-risk group (83.3 vs. 97.1 %; p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis demonstrated the cytokine high-risk group (p = 0.02) followed by Rai stage III-IV (p = 0.048) to be independent factors predicting shorter OS.

Here, we demonstrate that the PML protein undergoes ubiquitination-mediated degradation facilitated by an E3 ligase UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1), which is commonly upregulated in various human malignancies. Furthermore, UHRF1 negatively regulates PML protein accumulation in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), HEK 293 cells and cancer cells. Knockdown of UHRF1 upregulates whereas ectopic overexpression of UHRF1 downregulates protein abundance of endogenous or exogenous PML, doing so through its binding to the N-terminus of PML. Overexpression of wild-type UHRF1 shortens PML protein half-life and promotes PML polyubiquitination, whereas deletion of the RING domain or coexpression of the dominant-negative E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2D2, attenuates this modification to PML. Finally, knockdown of UHRF1 prolongs PML half-life and increases PML protein accumulation, yet inhibits cell migration and in vitro capillary tube formation, whereas co-knockdown of PML compromises this inhibitory effect. These findings suggest that UHRF1 promotes the turnover of PML protein, and thus targeting UHRF1 to restore PML-mediated tumor suppression represents a promising, novel, anticancer strategy.","['Guan, D', 'Factor, D', 'Liu, Yu', 'Wang, Z', 'Kao, H-Y']","['Guan D', 'Factor D', 'Liu Y', 'Wang Z', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120903,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', '*Ubiquitination']",2012/09/05 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012406 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.406 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Aug 15;32(33):3819-28. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.406.

SMZLs were characterized by overrepresentation of IGHV1-2 gene rearrangements with a canonical motif, without selection pressure and with long CDR3 segments. NMZLs had increased frequencies of IGHV3 genes. The IGHV gene was unmutated in most cases, often with long CDR3 segments. MALT lymphomas were usually associated with a mutated IGHV gene, but with the absence of selection pressure. WM/LPLs were associated with an IGHV3-23 overrepresentation and high IGHV mutation rate, with features of selection pressure and short CDR3 segments. MYD88 L265P mutations were almost restricted exclusively to WM/LPL patients. Taken all diagnoses together, all patients with MYD88 L265P mutations had an immunoglobulin M peak and almost all patients except one had bone marrow infiltration. These results demonstrate that the history of antigen exposure of the four entities studied was different and MYD88 L265P was specifically associated with WM/LPLs.

The interaction of Pim1 kinase and Runx3 in the pathogenesis of peanut allergy has not been defined. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effects of Pim1 kinase modulation on Runx3 expression and T(H)2 and T(H)17 cell function in an experimental model of peanut allergy. METHODS: A Pim1 kinase inhibitor was administered to peanut-sensitized and challenged wild-type and Runx3(+/-) mice. Symptoms, intestinal inflammation, and Pim1 kinase and Runx3 mRNA expression and protein levels were assessed. The effects of Pim1 kinase inhibition on T(H)1, T(H)2, and T(H)17 differentiation in vivo and in vitro were also determined. RESULTS: Peanut sensitization and challenge resulted in accumulation of inflammatory cells and goblet cell metaplasia and increased levels of Pim1 kinase and T(H)2 and T(H)17 cytokine production but decreased levels of Runx3 mRNA and protein in the small intestines of wild-type mice. All of these findings were normalized with Pim1 kinase inhibition. In sensitized and challenged Runx3(+/-) mice, inhibition of Pim1 kinase had less effect on the development of the full spectrum of intestinal allergic responses. In vitro inhibition of Pim1 kinase attenuated T(H)2 and T(H)17 cell differentiation and expansion while maintaining Runx3 expression in T-cell cultures from wild-type mice; these effects were reduced in T-cell cultures from Runx3(+/-) mice. CONCLUSION: These data support a novel regulatory axis involving Pim1 kinase and Runx3 in the control of food-induced allergic reactions through the regulation of T(H)2 and T(H)17 differentiation.","['Wang, Meiqin', 'Okamoto, Masakazu', 'Domenico, Joanne', 'Han, Junyan', 'Ashino, Shigeru', 'Shin, Yoo Seob', 'Gelfand, Erwin W']","['Wang M', 'Okamoto M', 'Domenico J', 'Han J', 'Ashino S', 'Shin YS', 'Gelfand EW']","['Division of Cell Biology, Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120901,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Runx3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-13/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-17/biosynthesis', 'Jejunum/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Th17 Cells/*cytology', 'Th2 Cells/*cytology']",2012/09/05 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(12)01219-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2012 Oct;130(4):932-44.e12. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.032.

The suppression of p53 protein results in interruption of DNA repair mechanisms in dividing malignant cells thereby increasing the DNA damage and activating p53-independent mechanisms of apoptosis. This ultimately may translate into enhanced cytotoxic effects of standard chemotherapy. Based on this rationale, Cenersen, a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide antisense to p53-mRNA was synthesized and tested in clinical trials for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). An important component of Cenersen clinical development is to develop a sensitive and specific method to quantify plasma and intracellular levels of Cenersen in different biologic matrices in order to determine tissue and intracellular distribution of the parent compound and its metabolites. Ultimately, this will allow us to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship for dose-effect correlation and design effective regimen to be rapidly translate into the clinic. An ELISA-based assay was adapted for assay development and validation of Cenersen in mouse plasma and cell lysate. Cellular uptake of Cenersen was studied in MV4-11 and KASUMI-1 AML cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure P53-mRNA expression changes in treated cells. The assay had a limit of quantification of 35pmol/L in mouse plasma. Within-day and between-day precision of <15% and accuracy nearly 100% were observed in a linear range of 10-2000pmol/L (R(2)=0.99) in AML cell lysate. The selectivity of this assay examined as cross-reactivity with its 3'N-1, 3'N-2-metabolites, was 16.8% and 0.4%, respectively, and with its mismatch and the scramble oligonucleotides was 0.06% and 0.4%, respectively. Cenersen was stable in mouse plasma up to 8h at 37 degrees C. When exposed to 0.1-1mumol/L Cenersen, MV4-11 and KASUMI-1 cells showed intracellular concentration in the range of 9.97-45.34nmol/mg protein and 0.1-2.1nmol/mg protein, respectively. Successful downregulation of p53-mRNA expression was observed in Cenersen treated cells. This ELISA-based assay was applicable to plasma and intracellular concentration measurement of Cenersen. Assessment of achievable concentration of Cenersen in different biologic matrices will be useful to elucidate the biological and clinical activity of this promising drug and define its recommended dose in future clinical trials.","['Alachkar, Houda', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Chan, Kenneth K']","['Alachkar H', 'Xie Z', 'Marcucci G', 'Chan KK']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120819,England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '872847-66-0 (cenersen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides/*blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*blood/genetics/*pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/05 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0731-7085(12)00470-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpba.2012.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2012 Dec;71:228-32. doi: 10.1016/j.jpba.2012.08.011.

Rarely, cases of composite MCL and CLL/SLL have been reported. Little is known about the nature of these cases and, in particular, the clonal relationship of the 2 lymphomas. Eleven composite MCL and CLL/SLL cases were identified. The clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic features of the MCL and CLL/SLL were characterized. IGH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) gene analysis was performed on microdissected MCL and CLL/SLL components to assess their clonal relationship. Ten patients had lymphadenopathy, and 7 patients had bone marrow involvement. The MCL component had the following growth patterns: in situ (n = 1), mantle zone (n = 3), nodular and diffuse (n = 3), diffuse (n = 3), and interstitial in the bone marrow (the only patient without lymphadenopathy) (n = 1); 6 MCLs had blastoid or pleomorphic and 5 small lymphocytic features. The CLL/SLL component was nodular (n = 9) or diffuse (n = 2). All MCL were CD5(+) and cyclin D1(+) with t(11;14) translocation. All CLL/SLL were CD5(+), CD23(+) and negative for cyclin D1 or t(11;14). IGH gene analysis showed that the MCL and CLL/SLL components displayed different sized fragments, indicating that the MCL and CLL/SLL are likely derived from different neoplastic B-cell clones. The lack of a clonal relationship between the MCL and CLL/SLL components suggests that MCL and CLL/SLL components represent distinct disease processes and do not share a common progenitor B-cell.","['Hoeller, Sylvia', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Xu-Monette, Zijun Y', 'Hoehn, Daniela', 'Bihl, Michel', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Ott, German', 'Said, Jonathan', 'Dunphy, Cherie H', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Lin, Pei', 'Wang, Michael', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Tzankov, Alexander', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Young, Ken H']","['Hoeller S', 'Zhou Y', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Hoehn D', 'Bihl M', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Rosenwald A', 'Ott G', 'Said J', 'Dunphy CH', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Lin P', 'Wang M', 'Miranda RN', 'Tzankov A', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Young KH']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1439, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120831,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Composite Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/09/05 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(12)00161-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2012.04.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2013 Jan;44(1):110-21. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2012.04.022.

METHODS: After stimulating the airway epithelial cell line HBE16 with IL-1beta, the expressions of NRG-1beta mRNA and mucin (MUC) 5AC mRNA were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the proteins of NRG-1beta and MUC5AC measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and phosphorylated erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB)1-4 detected by Western blot. The cells were pre-treated with antibodies of ErbB1-4, inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK1/2, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK)1 and antibody of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). After the addition of stimulant NRG-1beta, MUC5AC was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: IL-1beta could increase markedly the levels of NRG-1beta mRNA and MUC5AC mRNA and also the proteins of NRG-1beta and MUC5AC in a dose-dependent fashion. NRG-1beta at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, 200 nmol/L increased the expression of MUC5AC (0.328 +/- 0.055, 0.364 +/- 0.086, 0.650 +/- 0.134, 0.586 +/- 0.068) versus the control group (0.227 +/- 0.019). And the results had statistical significances (P < 0.05). The expressions of phosphorylated ErbB2 and ErbB3 stimulated by NRG-1beta were positive while those of phosphorylated ErbB1 and ErbB 4 negative. After a pretreatment of antibodies of ErbB2, ErbB3, inhibitors of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, MSK1 and antibody of CREB and a stimulation of NRG-1beta, the expression of MUC5AC decreased (0.221 +/- 0.033, 0.238 +/- 0.044, 0.386 +/- 0.021, 0.352 +/- 0.022, 0.294 +/- 0.017, 0.252 +/- 0.019) versus the NRG-1beta group (0.650 +/- 0.134).

METHODS: Forty consecutive adult patients with hematological malignancies received improved myeloablative unrelated CBT at a single center from September 2006 to May 2011. Their average age was (23 +/- 6) years and the average weight (58 +/- 9) kg. Thirty-five (87.5%) patients were high-risk and 15 (37.5%) at the advanced disease status at pre-transplantation. They received 1 (n = 23) or 2 (n = 17) cord blood units. Seventy-five percent of them were transplanted with 1/2-human leukocyte antigen mismatched unit. The conditioning regimen consisted of 12 Gy TBI, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus Ara-c and CY without ATG. All patients received a combination of cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: For the entire group of patients, the average cell doses infused were (4.1 +/- 1.1)x10(7) total nucleated cells/kg and (2.4 +/- 1.0)x10(5) CD34(+) cells/kg. All patients acquired engraftment with an implantation rate of 100%. The average time of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >/= 0.5x10(9)/L was (20 +/- 5) days and the average time of platelet >/= 20x10(9)/L was(38 +/- 12) days. Acute GVHD occurred in 23 patients (57.5%) and 4 (10.0%) were of grade III-IV. Chronic GVHD occurred in 22.9% (8/35) evaluable patients. Relapse occurred in 12.5% (5/40) patients. During a median follow-up period of 19.8 (range 4.6 - 55.0) months, the transplantation-related mortality was 15.0% (6/40) within 100 days and 35.0% (14/40) within 1 year. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia and severe acute GVHD. Two-year overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival was 58.8% and 58.8%, respectively. Two-year OS for patients with advanced or complete remission disease was 48.6% and 63.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TBI/Ara-c/CY myeloablative conditioning regimen is well-tolerated and capable of establishing sustained donor cell engraftment and decreasing the risks of transplant-related death in adults with hematologic malignancies.

On aggregate, these issues indicate that ATO might preempt cell growth and proliferation in NB4 cells through suppression of Pin1-mediated NF-kappaB-dependent stimulation of telomerase and survivin.","['Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Mirzaei, Roohollah', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran']","['Ghaffari SH', 'Momeny M', 'Bashash D', 'Mirzaei R', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari200@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PINX1 protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Survivin', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere Shortening/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2012/09/05 06:00,2012/12/13 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000008 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Jul;17(4):198-206. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, results derived from individually underpowered studies are conflicting. We carried out an updated meta-analysis on the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and ALL risk. METHODS: Relevant publications were searched through PUBMED and EMBASE databases. The associations between MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and the risk of ALL were evaluated by odds ratios (ORs). The heterogeneity and publication bias were estimated. Meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: C677T polymorphism was associated with a reduced risk of ALL (allele contrast: ORRE = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99). Subgroup analysis showed MTHFR C677T variant was associated with decreased susceptibility to ALL in children and Caucasians. Meta-regression showed the logOR for the association between T allele and ALL increased as sex ratio (M/F) in the case group increased (P = 0.01). Regarding A1298C polymorphism, no significant association was observed (allele contrast: ORRE = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.91-1.11). There was no publication bias for C677T or A1298C polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests that the C677T polymorphism, not A1298C, in MTHFR gene is associated with a decreased risk of ALL, particularly among children and Caucasians subjects. Our findings suggest that the influence of the C677T polymorphism on ALL susceptibility is modified by sex ratio in cases (M/F). Since folate intake may be a possible confounding factor, including this factor in future prospective studies is warranted. Further meta-analysis studies should be at least stratified for folate levels and gender to give more powerful and informative results.","['Wang, Haigang', 'Wang, Jiali', 'Zhao, Lixia', 'Liu, Xinchun', 'Mi, Wenjie']","['Wang H', 'Wang J', 'Zhao L', 'Liu X', 'Mi W']","['Pharmacy Intravenous Admixture Services, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20120904,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2012/09/05 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2350-13-77 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2350-13-77 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2012 Sep 4;13:77. doi: 10.1186/1471-2350-13-77.,PMC3459788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old man who is the primary caretaker for his disabled wife had low back pain after lifting her into a truck. The patient had a history of leukemia, multiple compression fractures, osteoporosis, and degenerative joint disease. His Revised Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire was 26%, with a 10/10 pain rating at its worst on the Numeric Pain Scale. The patient presented with a left head tilt, right high shoulder, and right high ilium with anterior translation and flexion of the torso and spasm and tenderness from the lower thoracic spine to lumbar spine. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was cared for using Activator Methods protocol. After 8 treatments, the patient was stable and remained stable for 4 months without spasm or tenderness in his spine. His Revised Oswestry score dropped to 6%, with a 4/10 Numeric Pain Scale pain rating when at its worst; and the patient reported being able to take care of his wife. CONCLUSION: The findings of this case suggest that Activator-assisted spinal manipulative therapy had a positive effect on low back pain and function in an elderly patient with a complex clinical history.","['Roberts, Jan A', 'Wolfe, Tristy M']","['Roberts JA', 'Wolfe TM']","['Doctor of Chiropractic, HealthQuest Chiropractic, Farmington, ME 04938.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Chiropr Med,Journal of chiropractic medicine,101163637,,,,2012/09/04 06:00,2012/09/04 06:01,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jcm.2011.05.001 [doi]', 'S1556-3707(11)00167-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Chiropr Med. 2012 Mar;11(1):16-23. doi: 10.1016/j.jcm.2011.05.001.,PMC3315872,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chiropractic', 'Leukemia', 'Low back pain', 'Osteoporosis', 'Spinal fractures']",,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated the down-regulation of miR-125b in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and HCC cell lines by Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. The ectopic expression of miR-125b reduced the cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression of HCC cells by targeting Mcl-1 and IL6R. Furthermore, the miR-125b-induced inhibition of cell proliferation was rescued by the expression of Mcl-1 or IL6R variants that lacked 3' UTRs. Thus, this study revealed the differential expression of miR-125b in HCC cells and elucidated its potential as a tumor suppressor in HCC development.","['Jia, Hong-Yan', 'Wang, Yu-Xuan', 'Yan, Wen-Ting', 'Li, Hui-Yu', 'Tian, Yan-Zhang', 'Wang, Shi-Ming', 'Zhao, Hao-Liang']","['Jia HY', 'Wang YX', 'Yan WT', 'Li HY', 'Tian YZ', 'Wang SM', 'Zhao HL']","['Department of Surgery, The First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China; E-Mails: swallow_jhy@163.com (H.-Y.J.); lihuiyu1978@126.com (H.-Y.L.); tyz2030@163.com (Y.-Z.T.); wangshimingSX@sina.com (S.-M.W.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120716,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (IL6R protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/09/04 06:00,2012/09/04 06:01,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijms13078762 [doi]', 'ijms-13-08762 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012;13(7):8762-74. doi: 10.3390/ijms13078762.

The eight MEFV gene variants (M694I, M694V, M680I (G/C-A), V726A, R761H, E148Q and P369S) were detected in 36 patients with ALL and 65 healthy controls; none had own and/or family history compatible with FMF. We identified 11 heterozygous inherited variants in the MEFV gene in both ALL patients and controls. The mean overall frequency of inherited variants in the MEFV gene rate was higher in ALL patients than healthy controls (P = 0.040). It is interesting to note that M680I/0 is predominant variant in patients with ALL. In addition, E148Q variant frequency was also significantly higher in the patient group than the controls (P = 0.012). In conclusion, overall frequency of inherited variants in the MEFV gene was found to be higher in patients with ALL. Based on the present data, it is difficult to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the possibility that inherited variants in the MEFV gene could represent a causative role in ALL. However, the data of our study may provide some new insights in understanding of individual genetic differences in susceptibility to these neoplasms. Further investigations are needed to determine the actual role of inherited variants in the MEFV gene in pathogenesis of ALL.","['Sayan, Ozkan', 'Kilicaslan, Emrah', 'Celik, Serkan', 'Tangi, Fatih', 'Erikci, Alev A', 'Ipcioglu, Osman', 'Sanisoglu, Yavuz S', 'Nalbant, Selim', 'Oktenli, Cagatay']","['Sayan O', 'Kilicaslan E', 'Celik S', 'Tangi F', 'Erikci AA', 'Ipcioglu O', 'Sanisoglu YS', 'Nalbant S', 'Oktenli C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110721,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2012/09/04 06:00,2012/09/04 06:01,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-011-0095-x [doi]', '95 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2011 Sep;27(3):164-8. doi: 10.1007/s12288-011-0095-x.

Based on the current analysis, we conclude that a joint immunophenotypic evaluation of PGP and cell cycle parameters like that adopted in this study is unlikely to reveal mechanisms of multidrug resistance associated with the clinical outcome.","['Elsayed, Ghada M', 'Ismail, Manar M', 'Moneer, Manar M']","['Elsayed GM', 'Ismail MM', 'Moneer MM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110621,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2012/09/04 06:00,2012/09/04 06:01,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-011-0086-y [doi]', '86 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2011 Sep;27(3):157-63. doi: 10.1007/s12288-011-0086-y.

Five patients who had undergone six transplants were included in the study and received a total of 38 (3-13) granulocyte transfusions during these six transplants. The median granulocyte concentration was 3.4 x 10(11) per apheresis bag. Full clinical and radiological recovery was achieved in three of the five high risk patients with active invasive fungal infection with the combination of antifungal agents and GTX. Even a very high risk patient with aplastic anemia who had undergone two consecutive transplants due to secondary graft failure was also cured of his primary disease despite the presence of multiple pulmonary fungus balls. Three of the five patients with very high risk features due to the underlying hematological disease and the associated active fungal infection were rescued with allogeneic HSCT performed with the support of GTX combined with antifungal agents. Despite the limitations of this report due to its retrospective nature, it suggests that GTX might be an alternative in patients with active fungal infections who otherwise are denied by the transplant programs. However, prospective randomized studies are required to draw a solid conclusion regarding the role of GTX in HSCT recipients in desperate situations such as active fungal infections.","['Yenicesu, Idil', 'Sucak, Gulsan', 'Dilsiz, Gunter', 'Aki, Sahika Zeynep', 'Yegin, Zeynep Arzu']","['Yenicesu I', 'Sucak G', 'Dilsiz G', 'Aki SZ', 'Yegin ZA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110605,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2012/09/04 06:00,2012/09/04 06:01,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-011-0078-y [doi]', '78 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2011 Sep;27(3):146-51. doi: 10.1007/s12288-011-0078-y.

Mutant FLT3 accelerates proliferation, suppresses apoptosis, and correlates with poor prognosis. Therefore, it is a promising therapeutic target. Here, we show that RNA interference against FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) potentiates the efficacy of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat (LBH589) against AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Similar to RNA interference, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; AC220/cpd.102/PKC412) in combination with LBH589 exhibit superior activity against AML cells. Median dose-effect analyses of drug-induced apoptosis rates of AML cells (MV4-11 and MOLM-13) revealed combination index (CI) values indicating strong synergism. AC220, the most potent and FLT3-specific TKI, shows highest synergism with LBH589 in the low nanomolar range. A 4-hour exposure to LBH589 + AC220 already generates more than 50% apoptosis after 24 hours. Different cell lines lacking FLT3-ITD as well as normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells are not significantly affected by LBH589 + TKI, showing the specificity of this treatment regimen. Immunoblot analyses show that LBH589 + TKI induce apoptosis via degradation of FLT3-ITD and its prosurvival target STAT5. Previously, we showed the LBH589-induced proteasomal degradation of FLT3-ITD. Here, we show that activated caspase-3 also contributes to the degradation of FLT3-ITD and that STAT5 is a direct target of this protease. Our data strongly emphasize HDACi/TKI drug combinations as promising modality for the treatment of FLT3-ITD-positive AMLs.","['Pietschmann, Kristin', 'Bolck, Hella Anna', 'Buchwald, Marc', 'Spielberg, Steffi', 'Polzer, Harald', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Heinzel, Thorsten', 'Bohmer, Frank-Dietmar', 'Kramer, Oliver H']","['Pietschmann K', 'Bolck HA', 'Buchwald M', 'Spielberg S', 'Polzer H', 'Spiekermann K', 'Bug G', 'Heinzel T', 'Bohmer FD', 'Kramer OH']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Friedrich-Schiller University, Hans-Knoll-Str. 2, Jena 07745, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Panobinostat', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0129 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0129 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Nov;11(11):2373-83. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0129.

It is mutated in approximately one-third of AML patients, mostly by internal tandem duplications (ITDs). Adaptor protein Lnk is a negative regulator of hematopoietic cytokine signaling. In the present study, we show that Lnk interacts physically with both wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) and FLT3-ITD through the SH2 domains. We have identified the tyrosine residues 572, 591, and 919 of FLT3 as phosphorylation sites involved in direct binding to Lnk. Lnk itself was tyrosine phosphorylated by both FLT3 ligand (FL)-activated FLT3-WT and constitutively activated FLT3-ITD. Both shRNA-mediated depletion and forced overexpression of Lnk demonstrated that activation signals emanating from both forms of FLT3 are under negative regulation by Lnk. Moreover, Lnk inhibited 32D cell proliferation driven by different FLT3 variants. Analysis of primary BM cells from Lnk-knockout mice showed that Lnk suppresses the expansion of FL-stimulated hematopoietic progenitors, including lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors. The results of the present study show that through direct binding to FLT3, Lnk suppresses FLT3-WT/ITD-dependent signaling pathways involved in the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Therefore, modulation of Lnk expression levels may provide a unique therapeutic approach for FLT3-ITD-associated hematopoietic disease.","['Lin, De-Chen', 'Yin, Tong', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Ding, Ling-Wen', 'Gueller, Saskia', 'Gery, Sigal', 'Tabayashi, Takayuki', 'Bergholz, Ulla', 'Kazi, Julhash U', 'Ronnstrand, Lars', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Lin DC', 'Yin T', 'Koren-Michowitz M', 'Ding LW', 'Gueller S', 'Gery S', 'Tabayashi T', 'Bergholz U', 'Kazi JU', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Stocking C', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore. dchlin10@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lnk protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46279-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-388611 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 18;120(16):3310-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388611.

METHODS: Childhood ALL case-parent triads (n = 120) were recruited from Texas Children's Hospital. DNA samples were genotyped using the Sequenom iPLEX MassARRAY for 68 tagSNPs in six folate metabolic pathway genes (MTHFR, MTRR, MTR, DHFR, BHMT, and TYMS). Log-linear modeling was used to examine the associations between maternal and offspring genotypes and ALL. RESULTS: After controlling for the false discovery rate (<0.1), there were 20 significant maternal effects in the following genes: BHMT (n = 3), MTR (n = 12), and TYMS (n = 5). For instance, maternal genotypes for BHMT rs558133 (relative risk [RR] = 0.51, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.87, p = 0.008, Q = 0.08) and MTR rs2282369 (RR = 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.27-0.80, p = 0.004, Q = 0.08) were associated with ALL. There were no significant offspring effects after controlling for the false discovery rate. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the few studies conducted to evaluate maternal genetic effects in the context of childhood ALL risk. Furthermore, we employed a family-based design that is less susceptible to population stratification bias in the estimation of maternal genetic effects. Our findings suggest that maternal genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway is relevant in the etiology of childhood ALL. The observed maternal genetic effects support the need for continued research of how the uterine environment may influence risk of ALL.","['Lupo, Philip J', 'Nousome, Darryl', 'Kamdar, Kala Y', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Lupo PJ', 'Nousome D', 'Kamdar KY', 'Okcu MF', 'Scheurer ME']","['Human Genetics Center, Division of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120901,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0058-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Nov;23(11):1797-803. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0058-z.

In pediatric oncology, they are successfully used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL). APL is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clinically characterized by a severe bleeding tendency with a highrisk of fatal hemorrhage. The molecular hallmark of this disease is the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR alpha) gene fusion that plays a critical role in promyelocytic leukemogenesis and represents the target of retinoid therapy. The introduction in the late 1980s of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) into the therapy of APL radically changed the management and the outcome of this disease. Presently, the standard front-line therapeutic approach for pediatric APL includes anthracycline-based chemotherapy and ATRA, leading to a complete remission in almost 90% of the patients. Neuroblastoma (NBL) is an aggressive childhood tumor derived from the peripheral neural crest. More than half of patients have a high-risk disease, with a poor outcome despite intensive multimodal treatment. Although the exact mechanism of action remains unclear, the introduction of 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) in the therapy of NBL has improved the prognosis of this disease. Currently, the standard treatment for HR-NBL consists of myeloablative therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and maintenance with 13-cis-RA for the treatment of minimal residual disease, leading to a 3-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) of about 50%.

Nevertheless, there is currently no study addressing the effects of vitexin on the induction of apoptosis in U937 human leukemia cells. The aim of this study was to determine the anticancer effects and molecular mechanisms of vitexin on U937 leukemia cells. We showed that vitexin can potently induce programmed cell death in U937 leukemia cell growth as well as morphological changes that were examined by MTT assay and phase contrast microscopy, respectively. The DNA content and the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) were determined by flow cytometric analysis. The cell cycle arrest-regulated and apoptosis-associated protein levels were measured by western blotting. Vitexin-triggered apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease of the level of Psim and the percentage of viability and provoked apoptosis in U937 cells. The downregulation of the protein level for Bcl-2 with the simultaneous upregulation of caspase-3 and -9 protein expression in U937 cells were observed after treatment with vitexin. Therefore, our data provide a potential mechanism for the chemopreventive activity of vitexin, and we suggest that vitexin may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of human leukemia.","['Lee, Chao-Ying', 'Chien, Yung-Shin', 'Chiu, Tai-Hui', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Lu, Chi-Cheng', 'Chiang, Jo-Hua', 'Yang, Jai-Sing']","['Lee CY', 'Chien YS', 'Chiu TH', 'Huang WW', 'Lu CC', 'Chiang JH', 'Yang JS']","['School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120830,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', '9VP70K75OK (vitexin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Nov;28(5):1883-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2000.

In a prospective phase II study in two centers, we administered purified NK cell products to high-risk patients treated with haploidentical T-cell-depleted SCT. Sixteen patients received a total of 29 NK cell infusions on days +3, +40 and +100 after transplantation. Median doses (and ranges) of infused NK- and T-cells per product were 1.21 (0.3-3.8) x 10(7)/kg and 0.03 (0.004-0.72) x 10(5)/kg, respectively. With a median follow-up of 5.8 years 4/16 patients are alive. Cause of death was relapse in five, GVHD in three, graft failure in three, and transplant related neurotoxicity in one patient. Four patients developed acute GVHD>/=grade II, all receiving a total of >/=0.5 x 10(5) T cells/kg. Compared with historical controls, NK cell infusions had no apparent effect on the rates of graft failure or relapse. Adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells is safe and feasible, but further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and timing of NK cell therapy.

To address this issue, we retrospectively analyzed 605 cytogenetically non-favorable AML patients younger than 50 years for whom a related donor search was performed during first CR (CR1). The 4-year OS was 62% in 253 patients with a related donor and 59% in 352 patients without a related donor (P=0.534). Allogeneic HCT was performed during CR1 in 62% and 41% of patients with and without a related donor, respectively. Among patients transplanted in CR1, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was significantly higher in patients without a related donor (P=0.022), but there was no difference in post-transplant OS between the groups (P=0.262). These findings show the usefulness of unrelated HCT in younger patients with cytogenetically non-favorable AML who do not have a related donor. The extensive use of unrelated HCT for such patients may minimize the potential disadvantage of lacking a related donor.","['Yanada, M', 'Kurosawa, S', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Uchida, N', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Kanamori, H', 'Usuki, K', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Watanabe, M', 'Nagafuji, K', 'Yano, S', 'Nawa, Y', 'Tomiyama, J', 'Tashiro, H', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Fujisawa, S', 'Kimura, F', 'Emi, N', 'Miura, I', 'Fukuda, T']","['Yanada M', 'Kurosawa S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Uchida N', 'Miyawaki S', 'Kanamori H', 'Usuki K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Watanabe M', 'Nagafuji K', 'Yano S', 'Nawa Y', 'Tomiyama J', 'Tashiro H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Fujisawa S', 'Kimura F', 'Emi N', 'Miura I', 'Fukuda T']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120903,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/04 06:00,2014/01/29 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2012159 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Mar;48(3):390-5. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.159.

We sequenced 29 SCLC exomes, 2 genomes and 15 transcriptomes and found an extremely high mutation rate of 7.4+/-1 protein-changing mutations per million base pairs. Therefore, we conducted integrated analyses of the various data sets to identify pathogenetically relevant mutated genes. In all cases, we found evidence for inactivation of TP53 and RB1 and identified recurrent mutations in the CREBBP, EP300 and MLL genes that encode histone modifiers. Furthermore, we observed mutations in PTEN, SLIT2 and EPHA7, as well as focal amplifications of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase gene. Finally, we detected many of the alterations found in humans in SCLC tumors from Tp53 and Rb1 double knockout mice. Our study implicates histone modification as a major feature of SCLC, reveals potentially therapeutically tractable genomic alterations and provides a generalizable framework for the identification of biologically relevant genes in the context of high mutational background.","['Peifer, Martin', 'Fernandez-Cuesta, Lynnette', 'Sos, Martin L', 'George, Julie', 'Seidel, Danila', 'Kasper, Lawryn H',

The study objective was to obtain societal preferences in the UK for ""progression-free"" and ""progressive"" states of late-stage CLL, refractory to current first and second line regimens. Preferences were also obtained for selected treatment-related adverse events (AEs). METHODS: A utility elicitation study, using the time trade-off (TTO) method, was conducted by face-to-face interviews with 110 subjects for a baseline disease state (before treatment), three primary disease states [progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment responder, PFS and treatment non-responder and disease progression], and 4 AE sub-states (PFS responder with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and infection, and PFS non-responder with infection). TTO scores were converted into utility values, and disutilities were calculated for AEs. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were obtained. RESULTS: The primary disease state mean TTO utility scores were: baseline: 0.549; PFS response: 0.671; PFS non-response: 0.394; and progression: 0.214. The mean TTO utility (disutility) scores for the AEs were: PFS response with thrombocytopenia, 0.563 (-0.108), neutropenia, 0.508 (-0.163), and infection, 0.476 (-0.195); PFS non-response with infection, 0.333 (-0.061). The VAS results were in line with the TTO results. CONCLUSIONS: The utility was higher for the PFS state than baseline, but decreased below baseline in non-response and disease progression states. AEs had an impact on utility within the PFS response state. The severe infection AE had a greater impact on utilities for the responding to treatment state compared to the non-responder state.","['Tolley, Keith', 'Goad, Catherine', 'Yi, Yunni', 'Maroudas, Penny', 'Haiderali, Amin', 'Thompson, Gwilym']","['Tolley K', 'Goad C', 'Yi Y', 'Maroudas P', 'Haiderali A', 'Thompson G']","['Tolley Health Economics, Buxton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120901,Germany,Eur J Health Econ,The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,101134867,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Consumer Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research', '*Quality of Life', 'United Kingdom', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/04 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10198-012-0419-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Health Econ. 2013 Oct;14(5):749-59. doi: 10.1007/s10198-012-0419-2.

The function and regulatory mechanism of TOPK in tumor cells remains unclear. Structural studies that could reveal the regulatory mechanism have been a challenge because of the unavailabity of TOPK's crystal structure. Hence, in this study, the 3D structure of TOPK protein has been constructed by using multiple templates. The quality and reliability of the generated model was checked and the molecular dynamics method was utilized to refine the model. APBS method was employed to know the electrostatic potential surface of the modeled protein and it was found that the optimum pH for protein stability is 3.4 which will further help in mechanistic hypothesis of TOPK protein. Active site of TOPK was identified from available literature and HTVS was employed to identify the lead molecules. The expected binding modes of protein-ligand complexes were reproduced in the MD simulation which indicates that the complex is relatively stable. The pharmacokinetic properties of the lead molecules are also under acceptable range. TOPK act as a substrate for CDK1 and the protein-protein docking and dynamics studies were carried out to analyze the effect of Thr9Ala mutation of TOPK in the two protein complex formation. It shows that the wild type complex is more stable when compared with the mutant type. Such structural information at atomic level not only exhibits the action modes of TOPK inhibitors but also furnishes a novel starting point for structure based drug design of TOPK inhibitors.","['Kirubakaran, Palani', 'Karthikeyan, Muthusamy', 'Singh, Kh Dhanachandra', 'Nagamani, Selvaraman', 'Premkumar, Kumpati']","['Kirubakaran P', 'Karthikeyan M', 'Singh KhD', 'Nagamani S', 'Premkumar K']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Science Block, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, 630 004, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120901,Germany,J Mol Model,Journal of molecular modeling,9806569,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (PDZ-binding kinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', '*Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Static Electricity', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time Factors']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2011/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00894-012-1566-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Model. 2013 Jan;19(1):407-19. doi: 10.1007/s00894-012-1566-1.

Aurora protein expression levels in pediatric ALL and AML patient samples were determined by western blot and reverse phase protein array. Both kinases were overexpressed in ALL and AML patients (P<0.0002), especially in E2A-PBX1-translocated ALL cases (P<0.002), compared with normal bone-marrow mononuclear cells. Aurora kinase expression was silenced in leukemic cell lines using short hairpin RNAs and locked nucleic acid-based mRNA antagonists. Aurora B knockdown resulted in proliferation arrest and apoptosis, whereas aurora A knockdown caused no or only minor growth delay. Most tested cell lines were highly sensitive to the AURKB-selective inhibitor barasertib-hydroxyquinazoline-pyrazol-anilide (AZD1152-HQPA) in the nanomolar range, as tested with an MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) assay. But most importantly, primary ALL cells with a high aurora B protein expression, especially E2A-PBX1-positive cases, were sensitive as well. In adult AML early clinical trials, clear responses are observed with barasertib. Here we show that inhibition of aurora B, more than aurora A, has an antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect on acute leukemia cells, indicating that particularly targeting aurora B may offer a new strategy to treat pediatric ALL and AML.","['Hartsink-Segers, S A', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Exalto, C', 'Luijendijk, M W J', 'Calvert, V S', 'Petricoin, E F', 'Evans, W E', 'Reinhardt, D', 'de Haas, V', 'Hedtjarn, M', 'Hansen, B R', 'Koch, T', 'Caron, H N', 'Pieters, R', 'Den Boer, M L']","['Hartsink-Segers SA', 'Zwaan CM', 'Exalto C', 'Luijendijk MW', 'Calvert VS', 'Petricoin EF', 'Evans WE', 'Reinhardt D', 'de Haas V', 'Hedtjarn M', 'Hansen BR', 'Koch T', 'Caron HN', 'Pieters R', 'Den Boer ML']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120903,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)', '29P8LWS24N (AZD 1152-HQPA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligonucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012256 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.256 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):560-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.256.

ATO induced differentiation at low concentrations (0.125 microM) and apoptosis at high concentrations (1-2 microM). Furthermore, ATRA induced greater differentiation than ATO. No synergistic effect of ATRA and ATO was found on differentiation. G-CSF promoted differentiation-inducing activities of both ATO and ATRA. The combination of ATRA and G-CSF showed maximum differentiation and ATO addition was not beneficial. Addition of 1 microM ATRA and/or 50 ng/ml G-CSF to ATO did not affect apoptosis compared to ATO treatment alone. ATRA induced expression of aquaporin-9 (AQP9), a transmembrane transporter recognized as a major pathway of arsenic uptake, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, treatment with 1 microM ATRA decreased arsenic uptake by 43.7% compared to control subject. Although G-CSF addition did not enhance AQP9 expression in the cells, the reduced arsenic uptake was recovered to the same level as that in controls. ATRA decreased cell viability and addition of 50 ng/ml G-CSF to ATRA significantly increased the number of viable cells compared with that in ATRA alone treated cells. G-CSF not only promotes differentiation-inducing activities of both ATRA and ATO, but also makes APL cells vulnerable to increased arsenic uptake. These observations provide new insights into combination therapy using these three agents for the treatment of APL.","['Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Horikoshi, Akira', 'Yoshino, Yuta', 'Toyoda, Hiroo', 'Aizawa, Shin', 'Takeuchi, Jin']","['Iriyama N', 'Yuan B', 'Hatta Y', 'Horikoshi A', 'Yoshino Y', 'Toyoda H', 'Aizawa S', 'Takeuchi J']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Itabashi Hospital, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (AQP9 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Oxides)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aquaporins/biosynthesis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Oxides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.2006 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Nov;28(5):1875-82. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2006.

Herein, we used a similar approach to determine f in blast cells derived from 19 individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in immortalized Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell cultures (human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines) from 19 healthy donors. The B-lymphoblastoid cell lines exhibited a unimodal distribution, with a median f value of 11 x 10(-6). In contrast, analysis of the f values for the ALL samples revealed at least two distinct populations: one population, representing approximately half of the samples (n = 10), had a median f value of 13 x 10(-6), and the remaining samples (n = 9) had a median f value of 566 x 10(-6).

In this study, we focused on the identification of the downstream targets of the TLR4 pathways. When THP-1 cells were treated with anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex, enhanced TF expression was observed, along with induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 MAPKs. When the activity of MAPKs was blocked by their corresponding inhibitors (SB203580: p38; U0126: ERK; SP600125: JNK), the expression of TF was reduced significantly. Furthermore, the anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 was inhibited significantly by TAK-242, a blocker of the signaling transduction mediated by the intracellular domain of TLR4; sc-204013, a specific inhibitor of IRAKs, was also able to partially inhibit the phosphorylation of the MAPKs. Our results demonstrated that MAPKs (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2) were the crucial downstream targets of the anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-triggered TLR4 signaling pathways in THP-1 cells. This essential role of MAPKs may also promote better understanding of the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).","['Zhou, Hong', 'Chen, Dongdong', 'Xie, Hongxiang', 'Xia, Longfei', 'Wang, Ting', 'Yuan, Wei', 'Yan, Jinchuan']","['Zhou H', 'Chen D', 'Xie H', 'Xia L', 'Wang T', 'Yuan W', 'Yan J']","['Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, PR China. hongzhou@ujs.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120830,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (beta 2-Glycoprotein I)', '0 (ethyl 6-(N-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)sulfamoyl)cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Complex/*immunology', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/*immunology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/*genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'beta 2-Glycoprotein I/*immunology']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(12)00679-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2012.08.303 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2012 Oct;130(4):e229-35. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2012.08.303.

One implication suggested by this finding is that IL-6 signaling is dependent upon cellular anti-oxidant defenses or redox status. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to directly test the hypothesis that JAK1 signaling by the IL-6-type cytokines in cardiac myocytes is impaired by glutathione (GSH) depletion, since this tripeptide is one of the major anti-oxidant molecules and redox-buffers in cells. Cardiac myocytes were pretreated for 6h with l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) to inhibit GSH synthesis. After 24h, cells were dosed with the IL-6-like cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). BSO treatment decreased GSH levels and dose-dependently attenuated activation of JAK1, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Addition of glutathione monoethyl ester, which is cleaved intracellularly to GSH, prevented attenuation of LIF-induced JAK1 and STAT3 activation, as did the reductant N-acetyl-cysteine. Unexpectedly, LIF-induced STAT1 activation was unaffected by GSH depletion. Evidence was found that STAT3 is more resistant than STAT1 to intermolecular disulfide bond formation under oxidizing conditions and more likely to retain the monomeric form, suggesting that conformational differences explain the differential effect of GSH depletion on STAT1 and STAT3. Overall, our findings indicate that activation of both JAK1 and STAT3 is redox-sensitive and the character of IL-6 type cytokine signaling in cardiac myocytes is sensitive to changes in the cellular redox status. In cardiac myocytes, activation of STAT1 may be favored over STAT3 under oxidizing conditions due to GSH depletion and/or augmented reactive oxygen species production, such as in ischemia-reperfusion and heart failure.","['Kurdi, Mazen', 'Sivakumaran, Vidhya', 'Duhe, Roy J', 'Aon, Miguel A', 'Paolocci, Nazareno', 'Booz, George W']","['Kurdi M', 'Sivakumaran V', 'Duhe RJ', 'Aon MA', 'Paolocci N', 'Booz GW']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Lebanese University, Rafic Hariri Educational Campus, Hadath, Lebanon. mkurdi@ul.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(12)00294-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2012.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2012 Dec;44(12):2106-15. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2012.08.016.

Within the protein-coding sequence (CDS) region, X. tropicalis Dleu7 consists of two exons and one intron. However, bioinformatic analysis indicates that this 211-amino-acid protein contains no obvious functional domains or known motifs. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and whole-mount in situ hybridization results revealed that, in addition to its expression in the blood island region, some regions of the central nervous system, and subdomains of the neural tube, X. tropicalis Dleu7 is zygotically expressed primarily in mesoderm tissues such as notochord and muscles during early embryogenesis. Expression in notochord is consistent with results from genome-wide association studies suggesting that DLEU7 is related to human adult height. Expression in the blood island region, where blood cell precursors (including B cells) are generated, implies a potential conserved role for Dleu7 in B-cell development between amphibians and mammals. Expression of Dleu7 in some regions of the central nervous system and subdomains of the neural tube also suggests other functions in development. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Dleu7 is a vertebrate-specific gene and undergoes strong selective pressure in lower vertebrates but is functionally constrained in higher mammals. When subcellular localization was examined by overexpression of enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein, Dleu7 showed centrosome localization with main distribution in cytoplasm. Treating gastrula embryos with SU5402, a small molecular inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, confirmed that Dleu7 expression in mesoderm is regulated by FGF signaling.

These patients were 25 men and 9 women with a median age of 59 years. We selected representative areas of paired bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and within the subsequent 48 months. Computer-assisted analysis was performed to calculate trabecular bone area (TBA) within the sample by using the equation TBA% = sum of trabecular area/total biopsy specimen area. Percentage changes were defined as DeltaTBA% and were arbitrarily subdivided into marked (>50%), moderate (10%-50%), and mild (<10%). During the study interval, TBA% increased in 24 patients (71%) and decreased in 10 patients (29%). Overall, there was a significant increase in TBA% (P = .02).

Within the chronic phase group, we could not separate patients resistant to imatinib therapy from those who were good responders. In our investigation of patients with pALL, a panel of MLPA probes broader than ever before was applied. Paired diagnostic and relapse samples from patients with pALL demonstrated clonally related or independent dominant clones, suggesting the presence of a pre-leukemic cell group.

Patients were analyzed at the first diagnosis, and the KIT mutations were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing technologies. The results demonstrated the presence of a G/A transition at codon 796, which is associated with the R796K protein variation. This mutation was detected at 21.42% in the CML subgroup and was absent in both AML patients and healthy controls; however, no correlation was found between this mutation and clinical parameters such as the molecular response to Gleevec.

Prognostic indicators are required for and aid in patient stratification. However, the prognostic value of genetic mutations and immunophenotypic features in elderly normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia, the largest cytogenetic risk group, remains unclear. We investigated the genetic mutations NPM1, FLT3-ITD, and FLT3-TKD and expression of the membrane antigens CD7, CD15, CD34, and CD56 in 144 elderly patients with de novo normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia to retrospectively analyze the prognostic and clinical relevance of these parameters. CD7, CD15, CD34, and CD56 were expressed in 24%, 47%, 52%, and 15% of patients, respectively. NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 51% and 17% of patients, respectively. Complete remission was obtained in 94 patients (65%), and the median overall survival was 16.5 months. Univariate analysis detected 5 markers with prognostic relevance: high leukocyte count, FLT3-ITD mutations, NPM1 mutations, CD34 expression, and CD56 expression in acute myeloid leukemia blasts. In multivariate analysis, patients with NPM1 predicted a higher complete remission (CR) rate (P = .016), longer event-free survival (P = .008), and longer overall survival (P = .049). FLT3-ITD mutations predicted a shorter event-free survival (P = .002) and shorter overall survival (P < .001). CD56 remained an independent predictor for lower CR rate (P = .021) and shorter event-free survival (P = .002). Our data highlight the prognostic importance of both genetic and immunophenotypic characteristics in this population of elderly patients with newly diagnosed normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia. By combining genetic and immunophenotypic markers, we can divide patients into distinct prognostic groups with important implications for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapy.","['Dang, Harry', 'Jiang, Allan', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Chang, Hong']","['Dang H', 'Jiang A', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Brandwein J', 'Chang H']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120828,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', '*Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(12)00145-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2012.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2013 Jan;44(1):55-61. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2012.04.008.

Although invariant natural killer T (iNKT) lymphocytes are a component of innate immunity implicated in many pathological processes, little is known on their characterization in swine. By addressing this issue using mouse alpha-galactosylceramide-loaded CD1d tetramers (alpha-GC-CD1dTT), which are commonly used to track iNKT cells, we were able to unequivocally identify CD3(+)alpha-GC-CD1dTT(+) cells in porcine peripheral blood, hereafter referred to as swine iNKT cells. These lymphocytes are enriched in CD4(-)CD8(+) and CD4(-)CD8(-) cells, harbor an activated-memory phenotype (SLA-DR(+)CD45RA(-)), express the intracellular promyelocytic-leukemia-zinc-finger (PLZF) transcription factor and are significantly enriched in IFN-gamma-producing cells after in vitro activation in comparison with conventional T cells. Importantly, in presence of IL-2 and IL-15, the iNKT cell ligand alpha-GC induces selective expansion of CD3(+)alpha-GC-CD1dTT(+) cells, confirming the reactivity of swine iNKT cells against alpha-GC. When associated with alpha-GC, IL-33, an alarmin of IL-1 family recently described to target iNKT cells, leads to a greater expansion of CD3(+)alpha-GC-CD1dTT(+) cells than IL-2 and IL-15. Altogether, our results provide the first phenotypic and functional description of swine iNKT cells allowing to further study the critical role of iNKT cells in porcine models of organ injury.","['Thierry, A', 'Robin, A', 'Giraud, S', 'Minouflet, S', 'Barra, A', 'Bridoux, F', 'Hauet, T', 'Touchard, G', 'Herbelin, A', 'Gombert, J-M']","['Thierry A', 'Robin A', 'Giraud S', 'Minouflet S', 'Barra A', 'Bridoux F', 'Hauet T', 'Touchard G', 'Herbelin A', 'Gombert JM']","['Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, CHU of Poitiers, 86021 Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120704,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (alpha-galactosylceramide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/*immunology', 'Cytokines/blood/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Galactosylceramides/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping/methods/veterinary', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Swine/blood/*immunology']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(12)00216-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.06.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2012 Oct 15;149(3-4):272-9. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.06.023.

It has been demonstrated that ellipsometric parameter Delta(t) showed much higher sensitivity at the initial phase of Au-protein and protein-protein interaction, while the parameter Psi(t) was more sensitive when the steady-state conditions were established. A new method, which taking into consideration this feature and nonlinear change of Delta(t) and Psi(t) parameters during various stages of biological layer formation process, was used for the calculation of antibody and antigen adsorption/interaction kinetics. The obtained results were analyzed using a model, which took into account partial reversibility during the formation of both antibody and antigen based monolayers. It was shown that the immobilization rate of antibody during the preparation of the sensing layer was similar for the formation of both intact and fragmented antibody based layers; however, the residence time was 25 times longer for intact antibody based layer formation in comparison to that of fragmented antibody based layer formation. On the contrary, residence time of antigen interaction with immobilized antibodies was about 8 times longer for the sensor based on fragmented antibodies. Moreover, it has been determined that the structural differences of immobilized antibodies (fragmented or intact) significantly influence antibody-antigen interaction rate, the major difference being in the residence time of antigen interaction with both types of immobilized antibodies.","['Baleviciute, Ieva', 'Balevicius, Zigmas', 'Makaraviciute, Asta', 'Ramanaviciene, Almira', 'Ramanavicius, Arunas']","['Baleviciute I', 'Balevicius Z', 'Makaraviciute A', 'Ramanaviciene A', 'Ramanavicius A']","['Department of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Vilnius University, Naugarduko 24, 03225 Vilnius, Lithuania. zbalevicius@ar.fi.lt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120731,England,Biosens Bioelectron,Biosensors & bioelectronics,9001289,"['0 (Antibodies, Immobilized)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Immobilized/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis/*immunology', '*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/virology', 'Equipment Design', 'Immunoassay/*instrumentation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Optics and Photonics/instrumentation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*immunology']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/01/29 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0956-5663(12)00457-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosens Bioelectron. 2013 Jan 15;39(1):170-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.017.

METHODS: We built on previous experience in the clinical laboratory to see whether a specialized histopathology service (hematopathology) could be provided to a developing country without the expertise or experience to do it in country. RESULTS: Over an 13-year period, 582 cases from 579 individuals were analyzed. Principal pathologic findings included acute leukemia in 84 cases (14%), dyspoiesis in one or more of the hematopoietic lineages in 65 cases (11%, including three cases with high-grade myelodysplasia), 23 cases (4%) with findings suspicious for a chronic myeloproliferative disorder, 35 cases (6%) with findings suspicious for a lymphoproliferative disorder, and infectious organisms (presumably Leishmania in most instances) in 9 (1%) of cases. Specimens from 45 cases (8%) were unsatisfactory owing to extreme hemodilution and/or specimen degeneration. CONCLUSION: With proper support, a medical laboratory in an industrialized nation may serve as a reference facility for a developing nation. The use of existing infrastructure may be remarkably effective to achieve optimal turnaround time. Although the lack of ancillary studies and follow-up biopsies limit the ability to achieve a definitive diagnosis in many cases, this must be viewed in the context of the limited ability to diagnose or manage hematopoietic neoplasia in developing nations.","['Deetz, C O', 'Scott, M G', 'Ladenson, J H', 'Seyoum, M', 'Hassan, A', 'Kreisel, F H', 'Nguyen, T T', 'Frater, J L']","['Deetz CO', 'Scott MG', 'Ladenson JH', 'Seyoum M', 'Hassan A', 'Kreisel FH', 'Nguyen TT', 'Frater JL']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120903,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Aircraft', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination/economics/standards', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Eritrea', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Hematologic Tests/economics/standards', 'Hematology/economics/methods/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Medicine/economics/methods/organization & administration', 'International Agencies', '*International Cooperation', 'Leishmaniasis/blood/*diagnosis/parasitology/pathology', 'Medical Oncology/economics/methods/organization & administration', 'Pathology, Clinical/economics/methods/organization & administration', 'Specimen Handling', 'Telecommunications', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'Voluntary Health Agencies']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12001 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Feb;35(1):77-81. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12001.

METHODS: We examined, by immunohistochemistry, expression of biological markers cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and B cell specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1( Bmi-1) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We studied the correlation between BLBC and several factors related to tumor progression, along with its prognostic value. RESULTS: In the 229 cases of operable TNBC, BLBC was detected in 178 (77.7%) and TN3BKE- in 51 (22.2%). There was no significant difference in clinicopathological factors between them, However, BLBC was significantly associated with Bmi-1 expression (P=0.000) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.045) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.041).

Full-length MDM4 (FL-MDM4), a splicing variant of MDM4 (S-MDM4) and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) mRNA expressions were detected by quantitative PCR in 140 Chinese patients with CLL, and primary CLL cells were treated in vitro with either fludarabine or Nutlin-3 to explore the interaction between p53 status and MDM4 or MDM2 expression. A marked increase of FL-MDM4 and S-MDM4 expressions were observed in the CLL patients with p53 aberrations (deletion and/or mutation) (P = 0.024, P < 0.001). A high level of S-MDM4 mRNA expression was associated with short treatment free survival (TFS) (P = 0.004). FL-MDM4 expression was significantly decreased after fludarabine treatment (P = 0.001) but increased after Nutlin-3 treatment (P = 0.008) of primary CLL cells without p53 aberrations. Both S-MDM4 and MDM2 expressions were significantly increased after fludarabine treatment of CLL cells without p53 aberrations (P = 0.013 and P = 0.030). MDM2 overexpression also occurred in CLL cells with p53 wild type after Nutlin-3 treatment (P = 0.018). FL-MDM4 and S-MDM4 overexpression are indicators of p53 aberrations in CLL patients, suggesting that those patients have a poor prognosis. FL-MDM4 inhibitory effects on p53 can be removed by MDM2-p53 and saved by Nutlin-3.","['Liu, Ling', 'Fan, Lei', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Zou, Zhi-Jian', 'Yang, Shu', 'Zhang, Li-Na', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Liu L', 'Fan L', 'Fang C', 'Zou ZJ', 'Yang S', 'Zhang LN', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121010,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2012/09/04 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/09/04 06:00'],"['2012/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12008 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Dec;103(12):2056-63. doi: 10.1111/cas.12008.

Each process is also supported by the delicate balance of the expression of multiple genes specific to each process. GATA1 is a transcription factor that comprehensively regulates the genes that are important for the development of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. Accumulating evidence supports the notion that defects in GATA1 function are intimately linked to hematopoietic disorders. In particular, the somatic mutation of the GATA1 gene, which leads to the production of N-terminally truncated GATA1, contributes to the genesis of transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in infants with Down syndrome. Similarly, a mutation in the GATA1 regulatory region that reduces GATA1 expression is involved in the onset of erythroid leukemia in mice. In both cases, the accumulation of immature progenitor cells caused by GATA1 dysregulation underlies the pathogenesis of the leukemia.

GS is an extramedullary tumor of myeloproliferative precursors and may involve multiple sites of the body, but involvement of male breast is extremely rare. In the absence of clinical history or hematological abnormality, GS may be misdiagnosed, depending on the degree of myeloid differentiation present within the tumor. Often it is misdiagnosed as lymphoma. Diagnosis is made by finding eosinophilic myelocytes, myeloperoxidase, chloroacetate esterase staining, and lysozyme immunostain. Chemotherapy regimens similar to acute myeloid leukemia are recommended to treat GS.

Meanwhile, challenging cases will always be present despite the hope and progress in CML in the TKI era.","['Uz, B', 'Bektas, O', 'Eliacik, E', 'Goker, H', 'Erbilgin, Y', 'Sayitoglu, M', 'Sayinalp, N', 'Aksu, S', 'Buyukasik, Y', 'Ozcebe, O', 'Haznedaroglu, I C']","['Uz B', 'Bektas O', 'Eliacik E', 'Goker H', 'Erbilgin Y', 'Sayitoglu M', 'Sayinalp N', 'Aksu S', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Ozcebe O', 'Haznedaroglu IC']","['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, 06100 Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20111103,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/263725 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2011;2011:263725. doi: 10.1155/2011/263725.

Therefore, in-silico inference of disease-related miRNA-EF interactions is becoming crucial not only for the understanding of the mechanisms by which miRNAs and EFs contribute to disease, but also for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. In this paper, we analyzed the human miRNA-EF interaction data and revealed that miRNAs (EFs) with similar functions tend to interact with similar EFs (miRNAs) in the context of a given disease, which suggests a potential way to expand the current relation space of miRNAs, EFs, and diseases. Based on this observation, we further proposed a semi-supervised classifier based method (miREFScan) to predict novel disease-related interactions between miRNAs and EFs. As a result, the leave-one-out cross validation has shown that miREFScan obtained an AUC of 0.9564, indicating that miREFScan has a reliable performance. Moreover, we applied miREFScan to predict acute promyelocytic leukemia-related miRNA-EF interactions. The result shows that forty-nine of the top 1% predictions have been confirmed by experimental literature. In addition, using miREFScan we predicted and publicly released novel miRNA-EF interactions for 97 human diseases. Finally, we believe that miREFScan would be a useful bioinformatic resource for the research about the relationships among miRNAs, EFs, and human diseases.","['Chen, Xing', 'Liu, Ming-Xi', 'Cui, Qing-Hua', 'Yan, Gui-Ying']","['Chen X', 'Liu MX', 'Cui QH', 'Yan GY']","['National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120824,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Theoretical']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043425 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-14187 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43425. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043425.

This is due to earlier findings that human OSM utilizes two receptor complexes, glycoprotein 130 (gp130)/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) (type I) and gp130/OSMR (type II), both with wide expression profiles. Murine OSM on the other hand only binds to the gp130/OSMR (type II) receptor complex with high affinity. Here, we characterize the receptor usage for rat OSM. Using different experimental approaches (knock-down of the OSMR expression by RNA interference, blocking of the LIFR by LIF-05, an antagonistic LIF variant and stably transfected Ba/F3 cells) we can clearly show that rat OSM surprisingly utilizes both, the type I and type II receptor complex, therefore mimicking the human situation. Furthermore, it displays cross-species activities and stimulates cells of human as well as murine origin. Its signaling capacities closely mimic those of human OSM in cell types of different origin in the way that strong activation of the Jak/STAT, the MAP kinase as well as the PI3K/Akt pathways can be observed. Therefore, rat disease models would allow evaluation of the relevance of OSM for human biology.","['Drechsler, Johannes', 'Grotzinger, Joachim', 'Hermanns, Heike M']","['Drechsler J', 'Grotzinger J', 'Hermanns HM']","['Rudolf-Virchow-Center, DFG Research Center for Experimental Biomedicine, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043155 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-12117 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43155. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043155.

Interest in PKCtheta as a potential drug target has increased following recent findings that PKCtheta is essential for harmful inflammatory responses mediated by Th2 (allergies) and Th17 (autoimmunity) cells as well as for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and allograft rejection, but is dispensable for beneficial responses such as antiviral immunity and graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) response. TCR/CD28 engagement triggers the translocation of the cytosolic PKCtheta to the plasma membrane (PM), where it localizes at the center of the immunological synapse (IS), which forms at the contact site between an antigen-specific T cell and antigen-presenting cells (APC). However, the molecular basis for this unique localization, and whether it is required for its proper function have remained unresolved issues until recently. Our recent study resolved these questions by demonstrating that the unique V3 (hinge) domain of PKCtheta and, more specifically, a proline-rich motif within this domain, is essential and sufficient for its localization at the IS, where it is anchored to the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 via an indirect mechanism involving Lck protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) as an intermediate. Importantly, the association of PKCtheta with CD28 is essential not only for IS localization, but also for PKCtheta-mediated activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the transcription factors NF-kappaB and NF-AT, which are essential for productive T cell activation. Hence, interference with formation of the PKCtheta-Lck-CD28 complex provides a promising basis for the design of novel, clinically useful allosteric PKCtheta inhibitors. An additional recent study demonstrated that TCR triggering activates the germinal center kinase (GSK)-like kinase (GLK) and induces its association with the SLP-76 adaptor at the IS, where GLK phosphorylates the activation loop of PKCtheta, converting it into an active enzyme. This recent progress, coupled with the need to study the biology of PKCtheta in human T cells, is likely to facilitate the development of PKCtheta-based therapeutic modalities for T cell-mediated diseases.","['Isakov, Noah', 'Altman, Amnon']","['Isakov N', 'Altman A']","['The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences and the Cancer Research Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120822,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2012/09/01 06:00,2012/09/01 06:01,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2012.00273 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2012 Aug 22;3:273. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00273. eCollection 2012.,PMC3425079,['R01 CA035299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD28', 'Lck', 'PKCtheta', 'costimulation', 'protein kinase C-theta', 'signal transduction']",,,,,,,

Studies employing mice lacking a functional p110delta protein, as well as the use of highly-selective chemical inhibitors of p110delta, have revealed that signaling via p110delta-containing PI3K complexes (PI3Kdelta) is critical for B-cell survival, migration, and activation, functioning downstream of key receptors on B cells including the B-cell antigen receptor, chemokine receptors, pro-survival receptors such as BAFF-R and the IL-4 receptor, and co-stimulatory receptors such as CD40 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Similarly, this PI3K isoform plays a key role in the survival, proliferation, and dissemination of B-cell lymphomas. Herein we summarize studies showing that these processes can be inhibited in vitro and in vivo by small molecule inhibitors of p110delta enzymatic activity, and that these p110delta inhibitors have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of several types of B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). PI3Kdelta also plays a critical role in the activation, proliferation, and tissue homing of self-reactive B cells that contribute to autoimmune diseases, in particular innate-like B-cell populations such as marginal zone (MZ) B cells and B-1 cells that have been strongly linked to autoimmunity. We discuss the potential utility of p110delta inhibitors, either alone or in combination with B-cell depletion, for treating autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. Because PI3Kdelta plays a major role in both B-cell-mediated autoimmune inflammation and B-cell malignancies, PI3Kdelta inhibitors may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating these diseases.","['Puri, Kamal D', 'Gold, Michael R']","['Puri KD', 'Gold MR']","['Gilead Sciences, Inc., Seattle WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120823,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2012/09/01 06:00,2012/09/01 06:01,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2012.00256 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2012 Aug 23;3:256. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00256. eCollection 2012.,PMC3425960,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAL-101', 'GS-1101', 'IC87114', 'autoimmunity', 'leukemia', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'p110delta', 'phosphoinositide 3-kinase']",,,,,,,

This novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer is localized in the ER and is cleaved in its transmembrane region in response to ER stress. BBF2H7 has been shown to be expressed in proliferating chondrocytes in cartilage during the development of long bones. The target of BBF2H7 is Sec23a, one of the coat protein complex II components. Bbf2h7-deficient (Bbf2h7(-/-)) mice exhibit severe chondrodysplasia, with expansion of the rough ER in proliferating chondrocytes caused by impaired secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We observed a decrease in the number of proliferating chondrocytes in the cartilage of Bbf2h7(-/-) mice. TUNEL staining of the cartilage showed that apoptosis was promoted in Bbf2h7(-/-) chondrocytes. Atf5 (activating transcription factor 5), another member of the CREB/ATF family and an antiapoptotic factor, was also found to be a target of BBF2H7 in chondrocytes. ATF5 activated the transcription of Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1), which belongs to the antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 family, to suppress apoptosis. Finally, we found that the BBF2H7-ATF5-MCL1 pathway specifically suppressed ER stress-induced apoptosis in chondrocytes. Taken together, our findings indicate that BBF2H7 is activated in response to ER stress caused by synthesis of abundant ECM proteins and plays crucial roles as a bifunctional regulator to accelerate ECM protein secretion and suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating the ATF5-MCL1 pathway during chondrogenesis.","['Izumi, Soutarou', 'Saito, Atsushi', 'Kanemoto, Soshi', 'Kawasaki, Noritaka', 'Asada, Rie', 'Iwamoto, Hideo', 'Oki, Mami', 'Miyagi, Hidetaka', 'Ochi, Mitsuo', 'Imaizumi, Kazunori']","['Izumi S', 'Saito A', 'Kanemoto S', 'Kawasaki N', 'Asada R', 'Iwamoto H', 'Oki M', 'Miyagi H', 'Ochi M', 'Imaizumi K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, University of Hiroshima, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120830,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Atf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Creb3l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sec23a protein, mouse)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cartilage/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/physiology', 'Growth Plate/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/01 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62594-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.373746 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Oct 19;287(43):36190-200. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.373746.

MLL interacts with menin in a bivalent mode involving 2 N-terminal fragments of MLL. In the present study, we reveal the first high-resolution crystal structure of human menin in complex with a small-molecule inhibitor of the menin-MLL interaction, MI-2. The structure shows that the compound binds to the MLL pocket in menin and mimics the key interactions of MLL with menin. Based on the menin-MI-2 structure, we developed MI-2-2, a compound that binds to menin with low nanomolar affinity (K(d) = 22nM) and very effectively disrupts the bivalent protein-protein interaction between menin and MLL. MI-2-2 demonstrated specific and very pronounced activity in MLL leukemia cells, including inhibition of cell proliferation, down-regulation of Hoxa9 expression, and differentiation. Our results provide the rational and essential structural basis to design next generation of inhibitors for effective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction in leukemia and demonstrate a proof of concept that inhibition of complex multivalent protein-protein interactions can be achieved by a small-molecule inhibitor.","['Shi, Aibin', 'Murai, Marcelo J', 'He, Shihan', 'Lund, George', 'Hartley, Thomas', 'Purohit, Trupta', 'Reddy, Gireesh', 'Chruszcz, Maksymilian', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz']","['Shi A', 'Murai MJ', 'He S', 'Lund G', 'Hartley T', 'Purohit T', 'Reddy G', 'Chruszcz M', 'Grembecka J', 'Cierpicki T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120830,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51590-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-429274 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 29;120(23):4461-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-429274.

The role of LTB4/BLT1 axis in tumor immunology, including cytokine-based tumor vaccine, however, remains unknown. We here demonstrated that BLT1-deficient mice rejected subcutaneous tumor challenge of GM-CSF gene-transduced WEHI3B (WGM) leukemia cells (KO/WGM) and elicited robust antitumor responses against second tumor challenge with WEHI3B cells. During GM-CSF-induced tumor regression, the defective LTB4/BLT1 signaling significantly reduced tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells, increased the maturation status of dendritic cells in tumor tissues, enhanced their CD4(+) T-cell stimulation capacity and migration rate of dendritic cells that had phagocytosed tumor-associated antigens into tumor-draining lymph nodes, suggesting a positive impact on GM-CSF-sensitized innate immunity. Furthermore, KO/WGM mice displayed activated adaptive immunity by attenuating regulatory CD4(+) T subsets and increasing numbers of Th17 and memory CD44(hi)CD4(+) T subsets, both of which elicited superior antitumor effects as evidenced by adoptive cell transfer. In vivo depletion assays also revealed that CD4(+) T cells were the main effectors of the persistent antitumor immunity.

The contribution of KLF7 to hematopoiesis has not been previously described. Herein, we characterized the effect on murine hematopoiesis of the loss of KLF7 and enforced expression of KLF7. Long-term multilineage engraftment of Klf7(-/-) cells was comparable with control cells, and self-renewal, as assessed by serial transplantation, was not affected. Enforced expression of KLF7 results in a marked suppression of myeloid progenitor cell growth and a loss of short- and long-term repopulating activity. Interestingly, enforced expression of KLF7, although resulting in multilineage growth suppression that extended to hematopoietic stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors, spared T cells and enhanced the survival of early thymocytes. RNA expression profiling of KLF7-overexpressing hematopoietic progenitors identified several potential target genes mediating these effects. Notably, the known KLF7 target Cdkn1a (p21(Cip1/Waf1)) was not induced by KLF7, and loss of CDKN1A does not rescue the repopulating defect. These results suggest that KLF7 is not required for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor function, but increased expression, as seen in a subset of lymphoid leukemia, inhibits myeloid cell proliferation and promotes early thymocyte survival.","['Schuettpelz, Laura G', 'Gopalan, Priya K', 'Giuste, Felipe O', 'Romine, Molly P', 'van Os, Ronald', 'Link, Daniel C']","['Schuettpelz LG', 'Gopalan PK', 'Giuste FO', 'Romine MP', 'van Os R', 'Link DC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120830,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Klf7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46302-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-409839 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 11;120(15):2981-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-409839.

Immortalized cells are more susceptible to double-strand breaks (DSB), which are subsequently repaired by homologous recombination (HR). BRCA1 is among the HR regulatory genes involved in the response to DNA damage associated with the RAD51 protein, which accumulates in DNA damage foci after signaling H2AX, another important marker of DNA damage. Topoisomerase IIIss (topoIIIss) removes HR intermediates before chromosomal segregation, preventing damage to cellular DNA structure. In breast carcinomas positive for BMI-1 the role of proteins involved in HR remains to be investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between BMI-1 and homologous recombination proteins. Using tissue microarrays containing 239 cases of primary breast tumors, the expression of Bmi-1, BRCA-1, H2AX, Rad51, p53, Ki-67, topoIIIss, estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and HER-2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We observed high Bmi-1 expression in 66 cases (27.6%). Immunohistochemical overexpression of BMI-1 was related to ER (p=0.004), PR (p<0.001), Ki-67 (p<0.001), p53 (p=0.003), BRCA-1 (p= 0.003), H2AX (p=0.024) and topoIIIss (p<0,001). Our results show a relationship between the expression of BMI-1 and HR regulatory genes, suggesting that Bmi-1 overexpression might be an important event in HR regulation. However, further studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms in which Bmi-1 could regulate HR pathways in invasive ductal breast carcinomas.","['da Silveira, Giorgia Gobbi', 'Oliveira-Costa, Joao Paulo', 'Soave, Danilo Figueiredo', 'Zanetti, Juliana Silva', 'Soares, Fernando Augusto', 'Ribeiro-Silva, Alfredo']","['da Silveira GG', 'Oliveira-Costa JP', 'Soave DF', 'Zanetti JS', 'Soares FA', 'Ribeiro-Silva A']","['Department of Pathology, Riberao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Riberao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinational DNA Repair/genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14670/HH-27.1353 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2012 Oct;27(10):1353-9. doi: 10.14670/HH-27.1353.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression in AML-M0 has been proposed by others as a surrogate for RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1) mutations, a mutation associated with distinct gene expression profiles in AML-M0. In this study, we investigated the significance of TdT expression in AML-M0 cases defined using the 2008 WHO classification criteria. Demographic, laboratory and clinical information were obtained from the hospital medical records. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, log-rank test and Fisher's exact test. The study group included 30 AML-M0 patients (male:female=19:11; median age: 60 years). In all, 10 cases of AML-M0 were positive for TdT(+) and 20 cases were negative for TdT(-). Patients with TdT+ AML-M0 had higher peripheral blood and bone marrow blast counts compared to patients with TdT- AML-M0 (P=0.01). TdT expression in AML-M0 was not associated with a distinct immunophenotype. Monoclonal IgH and TCR gene rearrangements were frequent, but independent of TdT expression in AML-M0. TdT expression in AML-M0 correlated with trisomy 13 and inversely correlated with aberrations of chromosomes 5 and 17. Among six patients with AML-M0 who received a stem cell transplant, overall survival was significantly longer for the three TdT+ patients compared with the three TdT- patients (P=0.03). In the TdT+AML-M0 subgroup, the three patients with stem cell transplant had better overall survival compared with five patients who did not receive stem cell transplant (P=0.01). We conclude that AML-M0, as currently defined in the 2008 WHO classification, can be divided into two groups based on TdT expression. Although there is a need to assess a greater number of patients, our results suggest that TdT positivity in AML-M0 identifies a subset of patients with a better prognosis after stem cell transplant.","['Patel, Keyur P', 'Khokhar, Faisal A', 'Muzzafar, Tariq', 'James You, M', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Pierce, Sherrie', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Patel KP', 'Khokhar FA', 'Muzzafar T', 'James You M', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Ravandi F', 'Pierce S', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120831,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2012142 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2012.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2013 Feb;26(2):195-203. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2012.142.

Enforced expression of ERG in murine hematopoietic cells leads to the development of a well-characterized lymphoid leukemia and a less well-defined non lymphoid disease. To clarify the latter, we generated murine bone marrow chimeras with enforced Erg expression in engrafted hematopoietic progenitor cells. As expected, these mice developed lymphoid leukemia. However, the previously reported non lymphoid disease that developed was shown to be a uniform, transplantable leukemia with both erythroid and megakaryocytic characteristics. In vivo, this disease had the overall appearance of an erythroleukemia, with an accumulation of immature erythroblasts that infiltrated the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lung. However, when stimulated in vitro, leukemic cell clones exhibited both erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, suggesting that transformation occurred in a bipotential progenitor. Thus, in mice, Erg overexpression induces the development of not only lymphoid leukemia but also erythro-megakaryocytic leukemia.","['Carmichael, Catherine L', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Henley, Katya J', 'Kruse, Elizabeth A', 'Di Rago, Ladina', 'Mifsud, Sandra', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Kile, Benjamin T']","['Carmichael CL', 'Metcalf D', 'Henley KJ', 'Kruse EA', 'Di Rago L', 'Mifsud S', 'Alexander WS', 'Kile BT']","['Cancer and Hematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville 3052, VIC, Australia. carmichael@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120830,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2012/09/01 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1213454109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1213454109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Sep 18;109(38):15437-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1213454109.

However, there are few reports on the global methylation status in MDS. The integration of genome-wide epigenetic regulatory marks with gene expression levels would provide additional information regarding the biological differences between MDS and healthy controls. Gene expression and methylation status were measured using high-density microarrays. A total of 552 differentially methylated CpG loci were identified as being present in low-risk MDS; hypermethylated genes were more frequent than hypomethylated genes. In addition, mRNA expression profiling identified 1005 genes that significantly differed between low-risk MDS and the control group. Integrative analysis of the epigenetic and expression profiles revealed that 66.7% of the hypermethylated genes were underexpressed in low-risk MDS cases. Gene network analysis revealed molecular mechanisms associated with the low-risk MDS group, including altered apoptosis pathways. The two key apoptotic genes BCL2 and ETS1 were identified as silenced genes. In addition, the immune response and micro RNA biogenesis were affected by the hypermethylation and underexpression of IL27RA and DICER1. Our integrative analysis revealed that aberrant epigenetic regulation is a hallmark of low-risk MDS patients and could have a central role in these diseases.","['del Rey, M', ""O'Hagan, K"", 'Dellett, M', 'Aibar, S', 'Colyer, H A A', 'Alonso, M E', 'Diez-Campelo, M', 'Armstrong, R N', 'Sharpe, D J', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Garcia, J L', 'De Las Rivas, J', 'Mills, K I', 'Hernandez-Rivas, J M']","['del Rey M', ""O'Hagan K"", 'Dellett M', 'Aibar S', 'Colyer HA', 'Alonso ME', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Armstrong RN', 'Sharpe DJ', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Garcia JL', 'De Las Rivas J', 'Mills KI', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120831,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (IL27RA protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (DICER1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics', 'Ribonuclease III/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012253 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.253 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):610-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.253.

Cellular activity against Aurora B is reflected by inhibition of phosphorylation of histone H3, induction of polyploidy, and inhibition of proliferation of a variety of leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor cell lines (IC(50) = 0.3-21 nM). In vivo inhibition of Aurora B was confirmed in an engrafted leukemia model by observing a decrease in phosphorylation of histone H3 that persisted in a dose-dependent manner for 8 h and correlated with plasma concentration of ABT-348. Evaluation of ABT-348 across a panel of 128 kinases revealed additional potent binding activity (K(i) < 30 nM) against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) families and the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. VEGFR/PDGFR binding activity correlated with inhibition of autophosphorylation in cells and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation (IC(50) </= 0.3 nM). Evidence of on-target activity in vivo was provided by the potency for blocking VEGF-mediated vascular permeability and inducing plasma placental growth factor. Activity against the Src kinase family was evident in antiproliferative activity against BCR-ABL chronic myeloid leukemia cells and cells expressing the gleevec-resistant BCR-ABL T315I mutation. On the basis of its unique spectrum of activity, ABT-348 was evaluated and found effective in representative solid tumor [HT1080 and pancreatic carcinoma (MiaPaCa), tumor stasis] and hematological malignancy (RS4;11, regression) xenografts. These results provide the rationale for clinical assessment of ABT-348 as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of cancer.","['Glaser, Keith B', 'Li, Junling', 'Marcotte, Patrick A', 'Magoc, Terrance J', 'Guo, Jun', 'Reuter, David R', 'Tapang, Paul', 'Wei, Ru-Qi', 'Pease, Lori J', 'Bui, Mai H', 'Chen, Zehan', 'Frey, Robin R', 'Johnson, Eric F', 'Osterling, Donald J', 'Olson, Amanda M', 'Bouska, Jennifer J', 'Luo, Yanping', 'Curtin, Michael L', 'Donawho, Cherrie K', 'Michaelides, Michael R', 'Tse, Chris', 'Davidsen, Steven K', 'Albert, Daniel H']","['Glaser KB', 'Li J', 'Marcotte PA', 'Magoc TJ', 'Guo J', 'Reuter DR', 'Tapang P', 'Wei RQ', 'Pease LJ', 'Bui MH', 'Chen Z', 'Frey RR', 'Johnson EF', 'Osterling DJ', 'Olson AM', 'Bouska JJ', 'Luo Y', 'Curtin ML', 'Donawho CK', 'Michaelides MR', 'Tse C', 'Davidsen SK', 'Albert DH']","['Abbott Oncology, Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120830,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '6L5D03D975 (ilorasertib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Histones/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Structure', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.112.197087 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.112.197087 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2012 Dec;343(3):617-27. doi: 10.1124/jpet.112.197087.

Complete information was available for only 83 patients. INTERVENTION(S): Conditioning chemotherapy, with or without GnRH-a before SCT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cyclic ovarian function (COF) or POF after SCT. RESULT(S): There were no significant differences in age, chemotherapy treatment, or diagnoses between the study and control groups.

The authors recognize the value of integration of divergent scientific fields in order to create new methods, concepts, paradigms, and knowledge. Herein they describe the recent emergence of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE), which represents an integration of population and molecular biologic science to gain insights into the etiologies, pathogenesis, evolution, and outcomes of complex multifactorial diseases. Most human diseases, including common cancers (such as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers, leukemia, and lymphoma) and other chronic diseases (such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, psychiatric diseases, and some infectious diseases), are caused by alterations in the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and interactome of all of the above components. In this era of personalized medicine and personalized prevention, we need integrated science (such as MPE) which can decipher diseases at the molecular, genetic, cellular, and population levels simultaneously.

Epigenetic downregulation of SFRPs by promoter hypermethylation has been described to be involved in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies. There is an association between aberrant Wnt signaling and the established cancer stem cell concept. In contrast to BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia CML, BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-MPN) are characterized by the frequent occurrence of an autoactivating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) or other mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway. However, pathogenetic mechanisms of JAK2 mutated or unmutated Ph-MPN remain not completely understood. We determined the promoter methylation status of SFRP-1, -2, -4, and -5 in 57 MPN patient samples by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (MSP). JAK2V617F was assessed by allele-specific PCR. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation among primary MPN samples was 4% for SFRP-1, 25% for SFRP-2, 2% for SFRP-4, and 0% for SFRP-5. Hypermethylation of SFRP-2, which was the most frequently hypermethylated gene in our study, could not be correlated to any specific MPN subtype. However, we detected a significant correlation between SFRP-2 methylation and presence of a JAK2V617F mutation (P = 0.008). None of the 10 CML samples showed any SFRP-methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that epigenetic dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a common event in MPN with aberrant methylation of at least one SFRP being detected in 25% of the primary patient samples and in 30% if only accounting for Ph-MPN. A significant correlation between SFRP-2 methylation and presence of JAK2V617F in our data supports the hypothesis that epigenetic dysregulation may be a complementary mechanism to genetic aberrations. Aberrant methylation of crucial stem cell maintenance genes seems to contribute to disease pathogenesis in Ph-MPN.","['Bennemann, Karla', 'Galm, Oliver', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Schubert, Claudia', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Jost, Edgar']","['Bennemann K', 'Galm O', 'Wilop S', 'Schubert C', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Jost E']","['Clinic for oncology, hematology and stem cell transplantation, Universitatsklinikum Aachen, RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, Aachen, 52074, Germany. ejost@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120831,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,,2012/09/01 06:00,2012/09/01 06:01,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1868-7083-4-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1868-7083-4-12 [doi]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2012 Aug 31;4(1):12. doi: 10.1186/1868-7083-4-12.,PMC3502569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein plays a critical role in multiple tumor suppressive functions, such as growth inhibition, apoptosis, replicative senescence, suppression of oncogenic transformation, and inhibition of migration and angiogenesis. These tumor suppression functions are recapitulated in several mouse models. The expression of PML protein is frequently downregulated in diverse types of human tumors and this downregulation often correlates with tumor progression. Recent evidence has emerged that PML is aberrantly degraded in various types of tumors through ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the PML ubiquitination/degradation pathways in human cancers. We point out that multiple pathways lead to PML ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, the PML ubiquitination processes are often dependent on other types of posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, prolylisomerization, and sumoylation. Such feature indicates a highly regulated nature of PML ubiquitination in different cellular conditions and cell contexts, thus providing many avenues of opportunity to intervene PML ubiquitination pathways. We discuss the potential of targeting PML ubiquitination pathways for anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.","['Chen, Ruey-Hwa', 'Lee, Yu-Ru', 'Yuan, Wei-Chien']","['Chen RH', 'Lee YR', 'Yuan WC']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. rhchen@gate.sinica.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120830,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*genetics']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-19-81 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-19-81 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2012 Aug 30;19:81. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-19-81.,PMC3438505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It plays vital roles in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell properties, functions as an oncogene in leukemia, and has been recently proposed to use for cord blood expansion. The mechanism(s) by which SALL4 functions in normal human hematopoiesis, including identification of its target genes, still need to be explored. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) was used for mapping SALL4 global gene targets in normal primary CD34+ cells. The results were then correlated with SALL4 functional studies in the CD34+ cells. RESULTS: More than 1000 potential SALL4 downstream target genes have been identified, and validation of binding by ChIP-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed for 5% of potential targets. These include genes that are involving in hematopoietic differentiation and self-renewal, such as HOXA9, RUNX1, CD34, and PTEN. Down regulation of SALL4 expression using small-hairpin RNA in these cells led to decreased in vitro myeloid colony-forming abilities and impaired in vivo engraftment. Furthermore, HOXA9 was identified to be a major SALL4 target in normal human hematopoiesis and the loss of either SALL4 or HOXA9 expression in CD34+ cells shared a similar phenotype. CONCLUSION: Taken together, SALL4 is a key regulator in normal human hematopoiesis and the mechanism of its function is at least in part through the HOXA9. Future study will determine whether modulating the SALL4/HOXA9 pathway can be used in cellular therapy such as cord blood expansion and/or myeloid engraftment.","['Gao, Chong', 'Kong, Nikki R', 'Li, Ailing', 'Tatetu, Hiro', 'Ueno, Shikiko', 'Yang, Youyang', 'He, Jie', 'Yang, Jianchang', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Kao, Grace S', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Chai, Li']","['Gao C', 'Kong NR', 'Li A', 'Tatetu H', 'Ueno S', 'Yang Y', 'He J', 'Yang J', 'Ma Y', 'Kao GS', 'Tenen DG', 'Chai L']","[""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120831,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03888.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2013 May;53(5):1037-49. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03888.x.

Eleven years after its first description in PubMed, the therapeutic potential of Sorafenib has been evaluated in an increasing number of studies, mainly focused on solid tumors. More recently, the potential usefullness of Sorafenib has started to emerge also against hematological malignancies. At the molecular level, besides the RAF kinase pathway, which represents the first therapeutic target of Sorafenib, additional kinases, in particular the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, have been identified as important targets of Sorafenib. A great interest for the potential use of Sorafenib against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arose when it was demonstrated that a specific mutation of a kinase gene, called FMS-like tyrosin-kinase-3- internal tandem duplication (FLT-3-ITD) and occurring in more than 30% of AML, represents a molecular target of Sorafenib. However, recent phase I and II clinical studies showed that, in spite of its ability to suppress the activity of this mutated kinase, resistence to Sorafenib rapidly occurs in AML, suggesting that Sorafenib will be more effective in combined therapy than used as single drug. Another critical molecular target of Sorafenib is the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. The ability of Sorafenib to rapidly shut-off Mcl-1 in virtually all the hematological malignancies investigated, including the B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, represents a key element for its antileukemic activity as well as for therapeutic combinations based on Sorafenib. In this respect, it is of particular interest that many chemotherapeutic drugs or innovative anti-neoplastic compounds, such as recombinant TRAIL or inibitors of MDM2 protein, are either unable to down-regulate Mcl-1 or in some instances promote a paradoxical induction of Mcl-1. In this review, the growing evidences for the role of Mcl-1 in mediating the anti-leukemic activity of Sorafenib will be discussed in relationship with promising therapeutic perspectives.","['Zauli, G', 'Voltan, R', 'Tisato, V', 'Secchiero, P']","['Zauli G', 'Voltan R', 'Tisato V', 'Secchiero P']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy. giorgio.zauli@unife.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/01 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-20120817-5 [pii]', '10.2174/092986712803341548 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2012;19(28):4875-84. doi: 10.2174/092986712803341548.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of transcriptional CDKs preferentially depletes short-lived proteins such as MCL1. We evaluated the in vitro toxicity of TG02 to primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells in the presence of survival signalling pathway activation by cytokines and fibronectin. One hundred nanomolar TG02 induced a median decrease of 40% in bulk cell survival and 43% in the CD34(+) CD38(-) CD123(+) subset. A 90% inhibitory concentration of 500 nmol/l indicated that TG02 toxicity is not halted by protective cell cycle arrest. Samples with FLT3 internal tandem duplication were not preferentially targeted. By flow cytometry, TG02 treatment caused loss of RNA Polymerase II serine 2 phosphorylation in patient samples, which correlated strongly with BAX activation (R(2) =0.89), suggesting these as potential biomarkers for clinical studies. MCL1 and XIAP expression also decreased. Repeated brief exposure to TG02 in MOLM-13 cells did not result in compensatory up-regulation of survival protein expression. In conclusion, TG02 is potently cytotoxic towards CD34(+) CD38(-) CD123(+) and bulk AML cells, despite protective signalling pathway activation. This antitumour activity is most likely mediated by dephosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II leading to depletion of survival molecules such as MCL1 and XIAP, with subsequent BAX activation and apoptosis.","['Pallis, Monica', 'Abdul-Aziz, Amina', 'Burrows, Francis', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Grundy, Martin', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Pallis M', 'Abdul-Aziz A', 'Burrows F', 'Seedhouse C', 'Grundy M', 'Russell N']","['Academic Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals City Campus, Clinical Sciences Building, Nottingham, UK. monica.pallis@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120830,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0', '(14-methyl-20-oxa-5,7,14,26-tetraazatetracyclo(19.3.1.1(2,6).1(8,12))heptacosa-1(', '25),2(26),3,5,8(27),9,11,16,21,23-decaene)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/09/01 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/09/01 06:00'],"['2012/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12018 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Oct;159(2):191-203. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12018.

The environment in which the leukemia cells are present during the drug treatment is known to provide significant survival benefit. Here, we have modeled this process by culturing murine Bcr/Abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in the presence of stroma while treating them with a moderate dose of two unrelated drugs, the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib. This results in an initial large reduction in cell viability of the culture and inhibition of cell proliferation. However, after a number of days, cell death ceases and the culture becomes drug-tolerant, enabling cell division to resume. Using gene expression profiling, we found that the development of drug resistance was accompanied by massive transcriptional upregulation of genes that are associated with general inflammatory responses such as the metalloproteinase MMP9. MMP9 protein levels and enzymatic activity were also increased in ALL cells that had become nilotinib-tolerant. Activation of p38, Akt and Erk correlated with the development of environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR), and inhibitors of Akt and Erk in combination with nilotinib reduced the ability of the cells to develop resistance. However, inhibition of p38 promoted increased resistance to nilotinib. We conclude that development of EMDR by ALL cells involves changes in numerous intracellular pathways. Development of tolerance to drugs such as nilotinib may therefore be circumvented by simultaneous treatment with other drugs having divergent targets.","['Feldhahn, Niklas', 'Arutyunyan, Anna', 'Stoddart, Sonia', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Schmidhuber, Sabine', 'Yi, Sun-Ju', 'Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Feldhahn N', 'Arutyunyan A', 'Stoddart S', 'Zhang B', 'Schmidhuber S', 'Yi SJ', 'Kim YM', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","[""Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis; Division of Hematology/Oncology and The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital; Los Angeles, CA USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,2012/08/31 06:00,2012/08/31 06:01,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/onci.20249 [doi]', '2012ONCOIMM0084 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncoimmunology. 2012 Aug 1;1(5):618-629. doi: 10.4161/onci.20249.,PMC3429566,['R01 CA090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vav1-deficient mice show thymic hypocellularity due to a partial block during thymocyte development at the DN3 stage and between the double positive (DP) and single positive (SP) transition. Vav1 has been shown to play a significant role in several non-hematopoietic tumors but its role in leukemogenesis is unknown. To address this question, we investigated the role of Vav1 in retrovirus-induced T cell leukemogenesis. Infection of Vav1-deficient mice with the Moloney strain of murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) significantly affected tumor phenotype without modulating tumor incidence or latency. M-MuLV-infected Vav1-deficient mice showed reduced splenomegaly, higher hematocrit levels and hypertrophic thymi. Notably, Vav1-deficient mice with M-MuLV leukemias presented with markedly lower TCRbeta/CD3 levels, indicating that transformation occurred at an earlier stage of T cell development than in WT mice. Thus, impaired T cell development modulates the outcome of retrovirus-induced T cell leukemias, demonstrating a link between T cell development and T cell leukemogenesis.","['Kaminski, Sandra', 'Adjali, Oumeya', 'Jacquet, Chantal', 'Garaude, Johan', 'Keriel, Anne', 'Lassaux, Adeline', 'Hipskind, Robert', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Taylor, Naomi', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Kaminski S', 'Adjali O', 'Jacquet C', 'Garaude J', 'Keriel A', 'Lassaux A', 'Hipskind R', 'Sitbon M', 'Taylor N', 'Villalba M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier; UMR 5535; CNRS; Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,2012/08/31 06:00,2012/08/31 06:01,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/onci.20225 [doi]', '2012ONCOIMM0086 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncoimmunology. 2012 Aug 1;1(5):600-608. doi: 10.4161/onci.20225.,PMC3429564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of non-natural indolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphates to inhibit the activity of hRR. The structural similarities of these analogues with dATP predicted that they would inhibit hRR activity by binding to its allosteric sites. In silico analysis and in vitro characterization identified one particular analogue designated as 5-nitro-indolyl-2'-deoxyribose triphosphate (5-NITP) that inhibits hRR. 5-NITP binding to hRR was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. X-ray crystal structure of 5-NITP bound to RR1 was determined. Cell-based studies showed the anti-cancer effects of the corresponding non-natural nucleoside against leukemia cells. 5-NITP binds to hRR with micromolar affinity. Binding does not induce hexamerization of hRR1 like dATP, the native allosteric inhibitor of hRR that binds with high affinity to the A-site. The X-ray crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RR1-5-NITP (ScRR1-5-NITP) complex determined to 2.3 A resolution shows that 5-NITP does not bind to the A-site but rather at the S-site. Regardless, 5-nitro-indolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside (5-NIdR) produces cytostatic and cytotoxic effects against human leukemia cells by altering cell-cycle progression. Our studies provide useful insights toward developing new inhibitors with improved potency and efficacy against hRR.","['Ahmad, Md Faiz', 'Wan, Qun', 'Jha, Shalini', 'Motea, Edward', 'Berdis, Anthony', 'Dealwis, Chris']","['Ahmad MF', 'Wan Q', 'Jha S', 'Motea E', 'Berdis A', 'Dealwis C']","['Corresponding Author: Chris Dealwis, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Wood Building, W303, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120828,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"[""0 (5-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxyribose triphosphate)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Calorimetry', 'Computational Biology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Light', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Nucleotides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Time Factors']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0199 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0199 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Oct;11(10):2077-86. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0199.

We show here that GFI136N, in contrast to GFI136S, lacks the ability to bind to the Gfi1 target gene that encodes the leukemia-associated transcription factor Hoxa9 and fails to initiate histone modifications that regulate HoxA9 expression. Consistent with this, AML patients heterozygous for the GFI136N variant show increased HOXA9 expression compared with normal controls. Using ChipSeq, we demonstrate that GFI136N specific epigenetic changes are also present in other genes involved in the development of AML. Moreover, granulomonocytic progenitors, a bone marrow subset from which AML can arise in humans and mice, show a proliferative expansion in the presence of the GFI136N variant. In addition, granulomonocytic progenitors carrying the GFI136N variant allele have altered gene expression patterns and differ in their ability to grow after transplantation. Finally, GFI136N can accelerate a K-RAS driven fatal myeloproliferative disease in mice. Our data suggest that the presence of a GFI136N variant allele induces a preleukemic state in myeloid precursors by deregulating the expression of Hoxa9 and other AML-related genes.","['Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Krongold, Joseph', 'Schutte, Judith', 'Bouwman, Frederique', 'Vassen, Lothar', 'Gaudreau, Marie-Claude', 'Chen, Riyan', 'Calero-Nieto, Fernando J', 'Diamanti, Evangelia', 'Hannah, Rebecca', 'Meyer, Sara E', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Patel, Chandrashekhar V', 'Peeters, Justine K', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Gottgens, Bertie', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Khandanpour C', 'Krongold J', 'Schutte J', 'Bouwman F', 'Vassen L', 'Gaudreau MC', 'Chen R', 'Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Diamanti E', 'Hannah R', 'Meyer SE', 'Grimes HL', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'Patel CV', 'Peeters JK', 'Lowenberg B', 'Duhrsen U', 'Gottgens B', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Gfi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53879-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-334722 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 8;120(19):4006-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-334722.

We aimed to boost antitumor immunity in B-cell lymphoma by developing a tumor cell vaccine incorporating alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) that targets the immune adjuvant properties of NKT cells. In the Emu-myc transgenic mouse model, single therapeutic vaccination of irradiated, alpha-GalCer-loaded autologous tumor cells was sufficient to significantly inhibit growth of established tumors and prolong survival. Vaccine-induced antilymphoma immunity required NKT cells, NK cells, and CD8 T cells, and early IL-12-dependent production of IFN-gamma. CD4 T cells, gamma/delta T cells, and IL-18 were not critical. Vaccine treatment induced a large systemic spike of IFN-gamma and transient peripheral expansion of both NKT cells and NK cells, the major sources of IFN-gamma. Furthermore, this vaccine approach was assessed in several other hematopoietic tumor models and was also therapeutically effective against AML-ETO9a acute myeloid leukemia. Replacing alpha-GalCer with beta-mannosylceramide resulted in prolonged protection against Emu-myc lymphoma. Overall, our results demonstrate a potent immune adjuvant effect of NKT cell ligands in therapeutic anticancer vaccination against oncogene-driven lymphomas, and this work supports clinical investigation of NKT cell-based immunotherapy in patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Mattarollo, Stephen R', 'West, Alison C', 'Steegh, Kim', 'Duret, Helene', 'Paget, Christophe', 'Martin, Ben', 'Matthews, Geoffrey M', 'Shortt, Jake', 'Chesi, Marta', 'Bergsagel, P Leif', 'Bots, Michael', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Smyth, Mark J']","['Mattarollo SR', 'West AC', 'Steegh K', 'Duret H', 'Paget C', 'Martin B', 'Matthews GM', 'Shortt J', 'Chesi M', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Bots M', 'Zuber J', 'Lowe SW', 'Johnstone RW', 'Smyth MJ']","['Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Australia. s.mattarollo@uq.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (alpha-galactosylceramide)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galactosylceramides/*administration & dosage', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor delta/physiology', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/physiology', 'Interleukin-18/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Vaccination']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46306-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-426643 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 11;120(15):3019-29. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-426643.

Leukemic precursor B cells may continue to undergo recombination of the IgH gene after malignant transformation; however, the magnitude of evolution at the IgH locus is currently unknown. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize the repertoire of IgH sequences in diagnostic samples of 51 children with B precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We identified clonal IgH rearrangements in 43 of 51 (84%) cases and found that the number of evolved IgH sequences per patient ranged dramatically from 0 to 4024. We demonstrate that the evolved IgH sequences are not the result of amplification artifacts and are unique to leukemic precursor B cells. In addition, the evolution often follows an allelic exclusion pattern, where only 1 of 2 rearranged IgH loci exhibit ongoing recombination. Thus, precursor B-cell leukemias maintain evolution at the IgH locus at levels that were previously underappreciated. This finding sheds light on the mechanisms associated with leukemic clonal evolution and may fundamentally change approaches for monitoring minimal residual disease burden.","['Gawad, Charles', 'Pepin, Francois', 'Carlton, Victoria E H', 'Klinger, Mark', 'Logan, Aaron C', 'Miklos, David B', 'Faham, Malek', 'Dahl, Gary', 'Lacayo, Norman']","['Gawad C', 'Pepin F', 'Carlton VE', 'Klinger M', 'Logan AC', 'Miklos DB', 'Faham M', 'Dahl G', 'Lacayo N']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology-Stem Cell Transplantation and Cancer Biology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. cgawad@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', '*Genetic Loci/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Validation Studies as Topic']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51637-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-429811 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 22;120(22):4407-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-429811.

Proliferation induced by zoledronic acid was used as a surrogate of gammadelta TCR-dependent stimulation to functionally interrogate Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in 106 untreated CLL patients. This assay permitted the identification of responder and low-responder (LR) patients. The LR status was associated with greater baseline counts of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells and to the expansion of the effector memory and terminally differentiated effector memory subsets. The tumor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region was more frequently unmutated in CLL cells of LR patients, and the mevalonate pathway, which generates Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCR ligands, was more active in unmutated CLL cells. In addition, greater numbers of circulating regulatory T cells were detected in LR patients. In multivariate analysis, the LR condition was an independent predictor of shorter time-to-first treatment. Accordingly, the time-to-first treatment was significantly shorter in patients with greater baseline numbers of total Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells and effector memory and terminally differentiated effector memory subpopulations.

METHODS: Forty cases of MTHL were analyzed for clinicopathology by microscopy and immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, according to the updated 2008 WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. RESULTS: In 40 cases of MTHL, there were 20 males and 20 females. The ratio of male/female was 1:1. The mean age was 31.8 years and median age was 29 years (range, 12 - 70 years).Superior vena cava syndrome was observed in 28 cases. The specimens of 4 cases were obtained by lumpectomy, whereas 36 cases by biopsy (25 cases by thoracoscopy, 1 by core needle aspiration). Twenty cases lay in anterior mediastinum, and 2 in posterior, 1 in superior, 8 in anterior and superior, 2 in posterior and superior, 2 in anterior and middle, 1 in middle and anterior mediastinum.Frozen section were performed in 28 cases, and 17 cases were diagnosed as tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (consistency ratio was 60.7%). Twelve cases were classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHL) (8 were nodular sclerosis subtype, and 3 were mixed cellarity, 1 was lymphocyte-rich subtype), and 10 were primary mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), 10 were precursor lymphocyte neoplasm [8 were T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas (T-LBL), 2 were B-LBL], 1 was MALT lymphoma, 1 was composite lymphoma (PMBCL and cHL), 2 were myeloid sarcomas, 4 were gray zone lymphomas (GZL) (3 had morphology reminiscent of cHL, and 1 of DLBCL, all cases were positive for CD20, PAX5, CD30 and CD15).EBER were detected in 11 cases by in situ hybridization, 2 of which were positive (18.2%), and the 2 positive cases were cHL. CONCLUSIONS: MTHLs occur predominantly in adolescents and young adults, mainly present as superior vena cava syndrome and anterior mediasinal masses. cHL, PMBCL, T-LBL were the most common MTHLs.GZLs mainly occur in young adults, those whose morphology reminiscent of cHL, immunohistochemistry reminiscent of PMBCL, and vice versa. Thoracoscopy, frozen section and a suitable panel of antibodies were practical approaches to MTHL.","['Chen, Ding-bao', 'Wang, Ying', 'Song, Qiu-jing', 'Shen, Dan-hua']","['Chen DB', 'Wang Y', 'Song QJ', 'Shen DH']","[""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2012.06.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Jun;41(6):376-81. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2012.06.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose that serial acquisition of mutations occurs in self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We investigated this model through genomic analysis of HSCs from six patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations present in individual AML patients harboring the FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutation. We then screened the residual HSCs and detected some of these mutations including mutations in the NPM1, TET2, and SMC1A genes. Finally, through single-cell analysis, we determined that a clonal progression of multiple mutations occurred in the HSCs of some AML patients. These preleukemic HSCs suggest the clonal evolution of AML genomes from founder mutations, revealing a potential mechanism contributing to relapse. Such preleukemic HSCs may constitute a cellular reservoir that should be targeted therapeutically for more durable remissions.","['Jan, Max', 'Snyder, Thomas M', 'Corces-Zimmerman, M Ryan', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Weissman, Irving L', 'Quake, Stephen R', 'Majeti, Ravindra']","['Jan M', 'Snyder TM', 'Corces-Zimmerman MR', 'Vyas P', 'Weissman IL', 'Quake SR', 'Majeti R']","['Program in Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and Ludwig Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (structural maintenance of chromosome protein 1)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics', '*Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Exome', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Founder Effect', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology/transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Preleukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['4/149/149ra118 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3004315 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2012 Aug 29;4(149):149ra118. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3004315.,PMC4045621,"['U01 HL099995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL099999/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,['NIHMS584758'],,,,,,,,,,

Treatment related adverse events, relapse rate and leukemia free survival (LFS) were analyzed. The results showed that the parameters of sex, age, cytogenetic risk and transplant procedures were comparable between the two groups. 30 patients had successful engraftment, except one had graft failure and one died from severe veno-occlusive disease in the NR group. The incidences of aGVHD in NR group and CR group were 47.1% (8 patients) and 33.5% (5 patients) respectively. Out of comparable patients, 5 from 9 patients in NR group developed with cGVHD, and 4 from 11 patients in CR group were subjected to cGVHD. There were no statistic difference in incidences of aGVHD and cGVHD between two group. Compa-red with CR group, NR group had a higher treatment-related mortality (29.4% vs 14.3%, P = 0.392) and relapse rate (42.9% vs 26.7% P = 0.300), but there was no significant difference. With a median follow-up of 13 (1 - 124) months, 6 patients remained alive in both of the two groups, and the 2 year LFS of them were parallel (35.3% vs 40.0%, P = 0.267). Among these 32 patients, overall survival (OS) was better in patients with age < 35 years (P = 0.044) and with the appearance of cGVHD (P = 0.046). It is concluded that allo-HSCT is an effective salvage therapy for patients with refractory and relapsed AML, and the overall outcome seems unrelated to the disease status (NR or CR) before transplantation. As such, for refractory and relapsed AML patients in non-remission, performance of allo-HSCT to achieve long-term survival is feasible.","['Zhou, Qian-Lan', 'Tang, Xiao-Wen', 'Sun, Ai-Ning', 'Qiu, Hui-Ying', 'Jin, Zheng-Ming', 'Miao, Miao', 'Fu, Zheng-Zheng', 'Zhao, Bing-Rui', 'Shi, Xiao-Lan', 'Chen, Guang-Hua', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Zhou QL', 'Tang XW', 'Sun AN', 'Qiu HY', 'Jin ZM', 'Miao M', 'Fu ZZ', 'Zhao BR', 'Shi XL', 'Chen GH', 'Wu DP']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)04-0954-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Aug;20(4):954-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adverse reactions of drug was evaluated in ALL children treated with BCH-2003-ALL chemotherapeutic protocol during 2004-10-1 to 2007-9-30 according to NCI-CTC V2.0. The TPMT gene sequences of ALL children with 3-4 grade of severe toxicity during the maintenance therapy were analyzed by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. To assure the accuracy of sequencing, the 738 bp fragment of coding region in TPMT gene (NM_000367) was divided into 3 subfragments and bidirectionally sequenced. The results indicated that among 133 ALL children, 61 were severely intolerant to 6-MP. The direct DNA sequencing showed that among 59 patients (excluding 2 cases without RNA samples), the simple myelotoxicity was found in 37 cases, hepato-myelotoxicity was observed in 9 cases, hepatotoxicity along appeared in 12 cases, 1 case showed skin rash.

The TPMT gene sequencing of 10 cases tolerant to 6-MP indicated that C474T mutation was detected in 8 cases which was homozygous mutation. It is concluded that the C474T mutation in 738 bp fragment of coding region in TPMT gene is very frequent, but it is not related with tolerance to 6-MP, suggesting that severe intolerance to 6-MP in ALL children may be not related with the mutation of coding region in TPMT gene.","['Ma, Xiao-Li', 'Li, Wei-Jing', 'Zheng, Jie', 'Wang, Bin', 'Jin, Mei', 'Zhang, Da-Wei', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Zhang, Yu-Xiang']","['Ma XL', 'Li WJ', 'Zheng J', 'Wang B', 'Jin M', 'Zhang DW', 'Li ZG', 'Zhang YX']","['Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. xiaolima1123@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)04-0876-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Aug;20(4):876-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell proliferation was assayed by using Cell Counting Kit-8. The morphological changes of HL-60 cells were examined by light microscopy and nucleolus morphological changes were observed by fluorescent microscopy after Hoechst 33342 staining. The early cell apoptosis was detected by using flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot assay was carried out to examine Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-3 expression. The results showed that Baicalin inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. HL-60 cells exhibited typical morphological features (for example, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies). Cell apoptosis in early stage could be detected, the expression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax mRNA was obviously up-regulated, while the Bcl-2 expression down-regulated, and accordingly Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased. Such results were consistent with the expression of these proteins. In addition, the expression of cleaved caspase-8 protein was induced significantly after treated with baicalin. It is concluded that baicalin can significantly inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells and induce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells, which may occur through decreasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio by intrinsic pathway and through extrinsic pathway. It suggests that baicalin may be a promising drug for the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Ren, Xia', 'Li, Cui-Ling', 'Wang, Heng-Xiao', 'Wen, Pei-E', 'Yuan, Chang-Jin', 'Li, Yan-Mei', 'Jiang, Guo-Sheng']","['Ren X', 'Li CL', 'Wang HX', 'Wen PE', 'Yuan CJ', 'Li YM', 'Jiang GS']","['Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '347Q89U4M5 (baicalin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)04-0847-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Aug;20(4):847-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The eEF1A1 mRNA and protein expressions of Jurkat cells and 3 healthy adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were detected by real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. eEF1A1-shRNA lentivirus was constructed through molecular biological method, and was used to transfect Jurkat cells. Then, cell eEF1A1 mRNA and protein expressions were detected by real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cycle were detected by MTT method, Annexin V-APC labeling and DNA ploidy analysis, respectively. Cell-related protein expressions of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. The results showed that eEF1A1 mRNA and protein expression levels of Jurkat cells were significantly higher than that of healthy adult PBMNC, respectively (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). eEF1A1 mRNA and protein expressions of Jurkat cells were significantly knocked down by constructing eEF1A1-shRNA lentivirus. Compared to negative control group (transfected with negative control-shRNA lentivirus), cell proliferation in eEF1A1-shRNA group was significantly inhibited, cell apoptosis was remarkably induced, cell cycle was blocked in G(0)/G(1) phase, and the expression levels of p-Akt (Ser 473), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), p-NF-kappaB (Ser 468), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p-mTOR (Ser 2448) proteins were significantly reduced. It is concluded that eEF1A1 may be a putative oncoprotein in T-ALL cells.

METHODS: A total of 2,574 adult patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies admitted to a single university hospital were enrolled into this study between 2001 and 2010. The clinical characteristics, image reports and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients (48 men and 24 women) with a median age of 56 (range 18 to 86) had an ICH. The overall ICH incidence was 2.8% among adult patients with hematological malignancies. The incidence of ICH was higher in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than in patients with other hematological malignancies (6.3% vs 1.1%, P = 0.001). ICH was more common among patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement of lymphoma than among patients with CNS involved acute leukemia (P <0.001). Sites of ICH occurrence included the cerebral cortex (60 patients, 83%), basal ganglia (13 patients, 18%), cerebellum (10 patients, 14%), and brainstem (5 patients, 7%). A total of 33 patients (46%) had multifocal hemorrhages. In all, 56 patients (77%) had intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 22 patients (31%) had subdural hemorrhage, 15 patients (21%) had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 3 patients (4%) had epidural hemorrhage. A total of 22 patients had 2 or more types of ICH. In all, 46 (64%) patients died of ICH within 30 days of diagnosis, irrespective of the type of hematological malignancy. Multivariate analysis revealed three independent prognostic factors: prolonged prothrombin time (P = 0.008), SAH (P = 0.021), and multifocal cerebral hemorrhage (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ICH in patients with AML is higher than patients with other hematological malignancies. But in those with intracranial malignant disease, patients with CNS involved lymphoma were more prone to ICH than patients with CNS involved acute leukemia. Mortality was similar regardless of the type of hematological malignancy. Neuroimaging studies of the location and type of ICH could assist with prognosis prediction for patients with hematological malignancies.","['Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tai, Chan-Hwei', 'Cheng, Aristine', 'Wu, Hung-Chang', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Liu, Jia-Hau', 'Chen, Pey-Ying', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chen CY', 'Tai CH', 'Cheng A', 'Wu HC', 'Tsay W', 'Liu JH', 'Chen PY', 'Huang SY', 'Yao M', 'Tang JL', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. chienyuanchen@ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120829,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroimaging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1741-7015-10-97 [pii]', '10.1186/1741-7015-10-97 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2012 Aug 29;10:97. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-10-97.,PMC3482556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) exposed to Paclitaxel (PTX) were able to uptake and subsequently release the drug in the culture medium. PTX primed hBM-MSCs (hBM-MSCsPTX) located in the vicinity of cancer cells produced a strong inhibition of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. To expand these observations, in the present study we exposed human skin derived fibroblasts (hSDFs) to 2,000 ng/ml of PTX and then tested both cells and their conditioned medium (CM) in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cell lines (MOLT-4, DU-145, U87-MG, SH-SY5Y(+) and LAN-5). We found that hSDFs primed with PTX (hSDFsPTX) were able to uptake and subsequently release PTX in a time dependent manner. hSDFsPTX-derived CM(hSDFsPTX-CM) from 1:4 to 1:10 dilutions produced a significant (p < 0.05) in vitro tumor growth inhibition. hSDFsPTX co-cultured with leukemia cells at 1:1 to 1:10 ratio, completely inhibited cells growth whereas no inhibition was induced by normal hSDFs cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that hSDFs can be loaded in vitro with PTX and thus can acquire a potent anti-tumor activity. Since hSDFs can be easily isolated from skin biopsies without any particular pain and discomfort to donor patients, we conclude that hSDFs may represent a valid cell type option for carrying and delivering anti-cancer drugs.","['Pessina, Augusto', 'Cocce, Valentina', 'Bonomi, Arianna', 'Cavicchini, Loredana', 'Sisto, Francesca', 'Ferrari, Maura', 'Ciusani, Emilio', 'Navone, Stefania', 'Marfia, Giovanni', 'Parati, Eugenio', 'Alessandri, Giulio']","['Pessina A', 'Cocce V', 'Bonomi A', 'Cavicchini L', 'Sisto F', 'Ferrari M', 'Ciusani E', 'Navone S', 'Marfia G', 'Parati E', 'Alessandri G']","['Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Via Pascal 36, 20133 Milan, Italy. augusto.pessina@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Delayed-Action Preparations/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Paclitaxel/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Skin/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['CMCACA-EPUB-20120824-21 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2013 Mar;13(3):523-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activating killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2DS1 has ligand specificity for HLA-C2 antigens and activates NK cells in an HLA-dependent manner. Donor-derived NK reactivity controlled by KIR2DS1 and HLA could have beneficial effects in patients with AML who undergo allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: We assessed clinical data, HLA genotyping results, and donor cell lines or genomic DNA for 1277 patients with AML who had received hematopoietic stem-cell transplants from unrelated donors matched for HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ or with a single mismatch. We performed donor KIR genotyping and evaluated the clinical effect of donor KIR genotype and donor and recipient HLA genotypes. RESULTS: Patients with AML who received allografts from donors who were positive for KIR2DS1 had a lower rate of relapse than those with allografts from donors who were negative for KIR2DS1 (26.5% vs. 32.5%; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.96; P=0.02). Of allografts from donors with KIR2DS1, those from donors who were homozygous or heterozygous for HLA-C1 antigens could mediate this antileukemic effect, whereas those from donors who were homozygous for HLA-C2 did not provide any advantage (24.9% with homozygosity or heterozygosity for HLA-C1 vs. 37.3% with homozygosity for HLA-C2; hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.75; P=0.002). Recipients of KIR2DS1-positive allografts mismatched for a single HLA-C locus had a lower relapse rate than recipients of KIR2DS1-negative allografts with a mismatch at the same locus (17.1% vs. 35.6%; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78; P=0.007). KIR3DS1, in positive genetic linkage disequilibrium with KIR2DS1, had no effect on leukemia relapse but was associated with decreased mortality (60.1%, vs. 66.9% without KIR3DS1; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.96; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Activating KIR genes from donors were associated with distinct outcomes of allogeneic HSCT for AML. Donor KIR2DS1 appeared to provide protection against relapse in an HLA-C-dependent manner, and donor KIR3DS1 was associated with reduced mortality.

In humans, anti-PEG may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of pegloticase in patients with chronic gout, but did not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract or honeybee venom or the response to PEG-IFN in patients with hepatitis C. Of major importance is the recent finding of a 22 - 25% occurrence of anti-PEG in healthy blood donors, compared with a very low 0.2% occurrence two decades earlier. This increase may be due to an improvement of the limit of detection of antibodies during the years and to greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and processed food products. These results raise obvious concerns regarding the efficacy of PEG-conjugated drugs for a subset of patients. To address these concerns, the immunogenicity and antigenicity of approved PEGylated compounds should be carefully examined in humans. With all these data in hand, patients should be pre-screened and monitored for anti-PEG prior to and throughout a course of treatment with a PEGylated compound. Finally, protein conjugates with the poorly immunogenic hydroxy-PEG sequence or other hydrophilic polymers are in early phases of development and may represent an alternative to immunogenic PEGylated proteins.","['Garay, Ricardo P', 'El-Gewely, Raafat', 'Armstrong, Jonathan K', 'Garratty, George', 'Richette, Pascal']","['Garay RP', 'El-Gewely R', 'Armstrong JK', 'Garratty G', 'Richette P']",,['eng'],['Editorial'],20120830,England,Expert Opin Drug Deliv,Expert opinion on drug delivery,101228421,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Drug Carriers/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use']",2012/08/31 06:00,2013/04/27 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17425247.2012.720969 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2012 Nov;9(11):1319-23. doi: 10.1517/17425247.2012.720969.

Imatinib (IM) was the first specifically targeted drug to be developed and has revolutionized the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To evaluate cellular uptake of IM, we developed a method based on the chemical structure of the molecule and using the natural UV fluorescence that we quantified by flow cytometry. In two CML cell lines, we obtained a satisfactory relationship between intracellular IM (ICIM) levels and media concentrations, and we found a strong correlation between ICIM at 1 h and IM efficacy at 24 h, demonstrating that ICIM at 1 h might be a relevant predictive parameter of cell sensitivity. Our method was more sensitive than the standard physicochemical method. We applied our method to primary cells and found cell morphology-dependent IM accumulation. Moreover, in CML cells from patients at diagnosis, IM accumulation was heterogeneous. In all cases, ICIM at the single-cell level was much higher than in culture media arguing in favor of a predominantly active uptake process. We developed a simple method directly applicable to primary cells that has shown two major advantages: only a small number of cells are required, and cell subsets can be identified according to morphological criteria and/or the presence of particular antigenic sites. This method provides a new tool to assess CML cell sensitivity to IM, and ICIM levels in native CML cells could be used to monitor therapeutic response.","['Bourgne, Celine', 'Bamdad, Mahchid', 'Janel, Alexandre', 'Libert, Frederic', 'Gagnieu, Marie-Claude', 'Rapatel, Chantal', 'Pigeon, Pascale', 'Pereira, Sylvie', 'Hermet, Eric', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Pereira, Bruno', 'Makhoul, Pascale Cony', 'Ansah, Atchroue Johnson', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Trouillier, Sebastien', 'Berger, Juliette', 'Boiret-Dupre, Nathalie', 'Berger, Marc G']","['Bourgne C', 'Bamdad M', 'Janel A', 'Libert F', 'Gagnieu MC', 'Rapatel C', 'Pigeon P', 'Pereira S', 'Hermet E', 'Guerci A', 'Pereira B', 'Makhoul PC', 'Ansah AJ', 'Cahn JY', 'Guyotat D', 'Trouillier S', 'Berger J', 'Boiret-Dupre N', 'Berger MG']","['Hematologie Biologique, CHU Estaing, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex 1, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

This study applied two data mining approaches to explore potential interactions among P53 and xenobiotic metabolizing genes in 230 AL patients [131 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 99 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] and 199 controls. Individually, none of the genotypes showed significant associations with AML risk. However, in ALL the CYP1A12A TC genotype was associated with increased risk (OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.14-3.58; P = 0.01), whereas the GSTM1 null genotype imparted reduced risk (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.31-0.96; P = 0.03). In classification and regression tree analysis, combinations of GSTM1 present, CYP1A12C AA or GG, EPHX1 exon3 TC, and EPHX1 exon4 AA or GG genotype strongly enhanced the risk of AML (OR = 5.89; 95% CI = 1.40-26.62; P = 0.01). In ALL, combinations of CYP1A12A TT, P53 GG or CC and GSTP1 AG genotypes conferred the highest risk (OR = 4.19; 95% CI = 1.45-12.25; P = 0.004). In multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, a four locus model (GSTP1, P53, EPHX1 exon3, and CYP1A12A) was the best predictor model for ALL risk. The association between this model and ALL risk remained true even at low prior probabilities of 0.01% (false positive report probability = 0.05). Interaction entropy interpretations of the best model of ALL revealed that two-way interactions were mostly synergistic. These results suggest that high order gene-gene interactions play an important role in AL risk.","['Chauhan, Pradeep Singh', 'Ihsan, Rakhshan', 'Mishra, Ashwani Kumar', 'Yadav, Dhirendra Singh', 'Saluja, Sumita', 'Mittal, Vishakha', 'Saxena, Sunita', 'Kapur, Sujala']","['Chauhan PS', 'Ihsan R', 'Mishra AK', 'Yadav DS', 'Saluja S', 'Mittal V', 'Saxena S', 'Kapur S']","['Department of Tumour Biology, National Institute of Pathology Indian Council of Medical Research, Safdarjung Hospital Campus, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120829,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Xenobiotics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/30 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.21723 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2012 Oct;53(8):619-30. doi: 10.1002/em.21723.

Here we present an intronic promoter of the murine proteinase 3 gene, which drives the expression of an alternative mRNA in intron 2 of the prtn3 gene. The proximal promoter sequences were identified and a series of promoter deletion constructs were used to identify the sequence elements that are required for basal promoter activity. Expression of the homeobox transcription factor CUX1 p75 isoform was found to suppress the activity of the alternative PR3 promoter. Data base analyses, multiple alignments and expression data showed that the intronic PR3 promoter is active in leukemia and other tumor cells as well as in mouse embryo, male mammary gland and bone marrow. In the spleen, the transcript is exclusively expressed by Gr-1(int) /CD11b(+) cells, which are also known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In humans, an alternative transcript of the PR3-gene could be detected in the bone marrow and in various cancer cell lines but not in primary leukemia cells, suggesting a species-overarching function of this kind of promoter. Therefore, the alternative PR3 promoter and its mRNA may be useful tools to investigate the fate of hematopoietic stem cells.","['Relle, Manfred', 'Becker, Marc', 'Meyer, Ralf G', 'Stassen, Michael', 'Schwarting, Andreas']","['Relle M', 'Becker M', 'Meyer RG', 'Stassen M', 'Schwarting A']","['I.

In this study we assess the effects of chemotherapy regimen on oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 38 newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia were recruited in this study. All patients received cytarabine and daunorubicin as chemotherapy regimen. Plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS), and the levels of erythrocyte activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were determined before chemotherapy and 14 days after chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin. Plasma MDA concentrations increased significantly (from 2.68 +/- 0.89 nmol/L to 3.14 +/- 1.29 nmol/L) during the 14 days post-chemotherapy period (P=0.04). Plasma TAS concentrations changed with chemotherapy from 1.09 +/- 0.15 mmol/L to 1.02 +/- 0.14 mmol/L with P=0.005. Erythrocyte SOD and GPX activity decreased overtime from 1157.24 +/- 543.61 U/g Hb to 984.01 +/- 419.09 U/g Hb (P=0.04) and 46.96 +/- 13.70 U/g Hb to 41.40 +/- 6.44 U/g Hb (P=0.02) respectively. We report here that there is an increase in malondialdehyde levels and a decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes and total antioxidant status. This suggests that chemotherapy causes these changes as a result of enormous production of reactive oxygen species in the patients with AML. Antioxidant supplementation must be approached with caution because of the probability of reduction the therapeutic efficacy of these cytotoxic drugs.","['Esfahani, Ali', 'Ghoreishi, Zohreh', 'Nikanfar, Alireza', 'Sanaat, Zohreh', 'Ghorbanihaghjo, Amir']","['Esfahani A', 'Ghoreishi Z', 'Nikanfar A', 'Sanaat Z', 'Ghorbanihaghjo A']","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Acta Med Iran,Acta medica Iranica,14540050R,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Superoxide Dismutase/blood']",2012/08/30 06:00,2013/01/03 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",['21699 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Med Iran. 2012;50(7):454-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significantly higher mortality during consolidation therapy was found, which is mainly due to deaths from sepsis following chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. METHODS: A total of 33 patients aged 60 years or older with de novo APL were treated with single-agent arsenic trioxide (ATO) for remission induction and postremission therapy. The postremission therapy continued for up to 4 years. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (87.9%) achieved a hematologic complete remission, and the most common adverse event during remission induction was leukocytosis (63.6%). Definite differentiation syndrome was observed in 5 patients. Nonhematologic adverse events were all manageable and reversible. Twenty-eight patients proceeded to postremission therapy. Adverse effects during postremission therapy were mild, transient, and no treatment was required. No patients died from ATO-related toxicities. With a median follow-up of 99 months, the 10-year cumulative incidence of relapse, overall survival, disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival were 10.3%, 69.3%, 64.8%, and 84.8%, respectively, which are comparable with those in the younger APL partners. No significant risks for development of chronic arsenicosis or second malignancy were observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the single-agent ATO regimen is safe and effective with long-term durable remission, and could be used as first-line treatment for elderly patients with de novo APL.","['Zhang, Yingmei', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Li, Jinmei', 'Li, Limin', 'Han, Xueying', 'Han, Lina', 'Hu, Longhu', 'Wang, Shuye', 'Zhao, Yanhong', 'Li, Xiaoxia', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Lv, Chengfang', 'Li, Yinghua', 'Su, Yanhua', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Li J', 'Li L', 'Han X', 'Han L', 'Hu L', 'Wang S', 'Zhao Y', 'Li X', 'Zhang Y', 'Fan S', 'Lv C', 'Li Y', 'Su Y', 'Zhao H', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou J']","['Central Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120828,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",2012/08/30 06:00,2013/02/23 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27650 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Jan 1;119(1):115-25. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27650.

Using cancer registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, we assessed trends in 5-year relative survival for patients aged 15 years or more with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia divided by racial and ethnic group, including non-Hispanic whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Pacific Islanders in the 1990s and the early 21(st) century. Modeled period analysis was used to obtain the most up-to-date estimates of survival. Overall, the 5-year survival increased from 31.6% in 1997-2002 to 39.0% in 2003-2008 for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and from 15.5% in 1991-1996 to 22.5% in 2003-2008 for those with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Nevertheless, among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, age-adjusted 5-year relative survival rates remained lower for African-Americans and Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites. Among patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, the increase in survival was greatest (from 32.6% in 1991-1996 to 47.1% in 2003-2008) for younger patients (15-54 years), and was more pronounced for non-Hispanic whites (+16.4% units) than for other patients (+10.8% units). Increases in survival are observed in all ethnic or racial groups. Nevertheless, among patients with acute leukemias, disparities in survival persist between non-Hispanic white people and people of other ethnic or racial groups. Disparities are increasing in younger patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Improvements in access to treatment, especially for minority patients, may improve outcomes.","['Pulte, Dianne', 'Redaniel, Maria Theresa', 'Jansen, Lina', 'Brenner, Hermann', 'Jeffreys, Mona']","['Pulte D', 'Redaniel MT', 'Jansen L', 'Brenner H', 'Jeffreys M']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. pultedi@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', '*Minority Groups', 'Minority Health', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/30 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.063602 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.063602 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Feb;98(2):222-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.063602.

ONX 0912 (oprozomib) is an orally bioavailable derivative. The activities of carfilzomib and ONX 0912 against solid tumor malignancies are less well understood. We investigated the impact and mechanisms of action of carfilzomib and ONX 0912 in preclinical models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of carfilzomib and ONX 0912 on HNSCC cell survival and xenograft tumor growth were evaluated. The impact and mechanisms of both agents on apoptosis and autophagy induction were also investigated. The contribution of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to autophagy induction and the role of autophagy in attenuating HNSCC cell death were determined. RESULTS: Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 potently induced apoptosis in HNSCC cell lines via upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bik. Upregulation of Mcl-1 by these agents served to dampen their efficacies. Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 also induced autophagy, mediated, in part, by activation of the UPR pathway involving upregulation of ATF4 transcription factor. Autophagy induction served a prosurvival role. Oral administration of ONX 0912 inhibited the growth of HNSCC xenograft tumors in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that carfilzomib and ONX 0912 are potently active against HNSCC cells, and the activities of these agents can be enhanced via suppression of Mcl-1 or inhibition of autophagy. Oral ONX 0912 exhibits in vivo activity against HNSCC tumors and may represent a useful therapeutic agent for this malignancy.","['Zang, Yan', 'Thomas, Sufi M', 'Chan, Elena T', 'Kirk, Christopher J', 'Freilino, Maria L', 'DeLancey, Hannah M', 'Grandis, Jennifer R', 'Li, Changyou', 'Johnson, Daniel E']","['Zang Y', 'Thomas SM', 'Chan ET', 'Kirk CJ', 'Freilino ML', 'DeLancey HM', 'Grandis JR', 'Li C', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120828,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antinematodal Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (ONX 0912)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antinematodal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Head and Neck Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Neoplasms, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Unfolded Protein Response']",2012/08/30 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-1213 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1213 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Oct 15;18(20):5639-49. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1213.

We previously reported that cells expressing the K1 protein of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) resist death through the complex formation of the Ig-like domain of K1 with Fas. Recently, we investigated whether peptides derived from the Ig-like domain of the K1 protein may affect cell death. METHODS: K1 positive and negative cell lines were incubated with the K1-derived peptides, and cell death (apoptotic and necrotic) was assessed by flow cytometry and LDH assay. Activation of caspases was assessed by fluorometric assay and flow cytometry. Fas receptor-independent, peptide-mediated cell killing was tested in the Fas-resistant Daudi cell line and Jurkat cell clones deficient in caspase-8 and FADD functionality. Activation of TNF receptors I and II was blocked by pre-incubation with corresponding blocking antibodies. The effect of the K1 peptide in vivo was tested in a mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We observed that the peptide S20-3 enhanced cell death in K1-positive BJAB cells and HHV-8 positive primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines. Similar effects of this peptide were observed in B-cell lymphoma and T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells without K1 expression but not in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A single intratumoral injection of the S20-3 peptide decreased the growth of Jurkat xenografts in SCID mice. The mechanism of tumor cell death induced by the S20-3 peptide was associated with activation of caspases, but this activity was only partially inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD. Furthermore, the K1 peptide also killed Fas-resistant Daudi cells, and this killing effect was inhibited by pre-incubation of cells with antibodies blocking TNFRI. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings indicate that the S20-3 peptide can selectively induce the death of malignant hematological cell lines by Fas- and/or TNFRI-dependent mechanisms, suggesting the K1-derived peptide or peptidomimetic may have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematological cancers.","['Daniluk, Urszula', 'Kerros, Celine', 'Tao, Rong-Hua', 'Wise, Jillian F', 'Ao, Xue', 'Berkova, Zuzana', 'Samaniego, Felipe']","['Daniluk U', 'Kerros C', 'Tao RH', 'Wise JF', 'Ao X', 'Berkova Z', 'Samaniego F']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (K1 protein, Human herpesvirus 8)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Peptides/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Viral Proteins/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis', '*fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/30 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-31-69 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-31-69 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 28;31:69. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-31-69.,PMC3517441,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA158692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA1206173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK091490/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA153170/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRT was mostly abolished in the eighties because of its neurotoxicity, and replaced with more intensive intrathecal CT. In this study, a group of survivors treated with CRT before 1983 and another group treated without CRT thereafter are investigated 20-25 years later, giving a much stronger perspective on long-term quality of life than previous studies. The outcomes will help to better understand these groups' current needs and will aid in anticipating late effects of prophylactic CRT that is currently applied for other diseases. This study evaluates oscillatory neuronal activity in these long-term survivors. Power spectrum deviations are hypothesized to correlate with cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: Resting state eyes-closed magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were obtained from 14 ALL survivors treated with CT + CRT, 18 treated with CT alone and 35 controls. Relative spectral power was calculated in the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma frequency bands. The Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT) program was used to assess cognition in the executive functions domain. MEG data and ANT scores were correlated. RESULTS: In the CT + CRT group, relative theta power was slightly increased (p = 0.069) and alpha2 power was significantly decreased (p = 0.006). The CT + CRT group performed worse on various cognitive tests. A deficiency in visuomotor accuracy, especially of the right hand, could be clearly associated with the deviating regional theta and alpha2 powers (0.471 < r < 0.697). A significant association between decreased regional alpha2 power and less attentional fluctuations was found for CT + CRT patients as well as controls (0.078 < r < 0.666). Patients treated with CT alone displayed a power spectrum similar to controls, except for a significantly increased level of left frontal alpha2 power (p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: The tendency towards global slowing of brain oscillatory activity, together with the fact that dementia has been reported as a late effect of CRT and the neuropsychological deficiencies currently present, suggest that the irradiated brain might be aging faster and could be at risk for early-onset dementia. The CT group showed no signs of early aging.","['Daams, Marita', 'Schuitema, Ilse', 'van Dijk, Bob W', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder, Eline', 'Veerman, Anjo Jp', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'de Sonneville, Leo Mj']","['Daams M', 'Schuitema I', 'van Dijk BW', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder E', 'Veerman AJ', 'van den Bos C', 'de Sonneville LM']","['Department of Clinical Child and Adolescent Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences & Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden University, Wassenaarseweg 52, P,O, Box 9555, 2300 RB, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*prevention & control', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal/adverse effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetoencephalography/*methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*prevention & control', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal/*adverse effects', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/30 06:00,2013/05/18 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2377-12-84 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2377-12-84 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2012 Aug 28;12:84. doi: 10.1186/1471-2377-12-84.,PMC3517522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Type II isoform of this enzyme is selectively upregulated in lymphocytes and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, and is an excellent target for antileukemic agent. The molecular dynamics simulation results (15 ns) of three unliganded 1B3O, 1JCN, and 1JR1 structures have clearly revealed that IN, IC (N- and C-terminal of catalytic domains) and C1, C2 (cystathionine-beta-synthase-1 and 2) domains of IMPDH enzyme have been stabilized by six conserved water (center) mediated salt bridge interactions. These conserved water molecules could be involved in interdomain or intradomain recognition, intradomain coupling, and charge transfer processes. The binding propensity of cystathionine-beta-synthase domain to catalytic domain (through conserved water-mediated salt bridges) has provided a new insight to the biochemistry of IMPDH. Stereospecific interaction of IN with C2 domain through conserved water molecule (K109-W(II) 1-D215/D216) is observed to be unique in the simulated structure of hIMPDH-II. The geometrical/structural consequences and topological feature around the W(II) 1 water center may be utilized for isoform specific inhibitor design for CML cancer.

Histopathological investigation is usually required for this condition, because clinical data are frequently insufficient to make a definite diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To identify and analyze the causes of patients presenting with tender leg nodules and to reveal clinical clues that could help to differentiate causes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records and histopathological slides of patients presenting with tender cutaneous nodules of the legs between January 2005 and December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of the total of 154 patients, 122 (79.2%) were female. Definite diagnoses were categorized into four groups: inflammation (84.4%); infection (5.8%); tumor (6.5%); and nonspecific (3.2%). The most common cause in the inflammation group was erythema nodosum. The infections found were Acremonium spp., Penicillium sp., Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium leprae. The tumors included leiomyoma, leukemia cutis, and lymphomas. Clinical data that correlated with and could be used as clues for the inflammation group were female sex (P = 0.03, OR 6.43) and lower leg involvement (P = 0.03, OR 7.14). LIMITATIONS: The retrospective manner of this study is a limitation. CONCLUSION: Various inflammatory conditions, infections, and tumors can present as tender cutaneous nodules of the legs. Female sex and lower leg involvement were clinical data that could be used as clues for the diagnoses in the inflammation group. However, histopathological investigation is still crucial to determine a definite diagnosis in patients presenting with tender cutaneous nodules of the legs.","['Eimpunth, Sasima', 'Pattanaprichakul, Penvadee', 'Sitthinamsuwa, Panitta', 'Chularojanamontri, Leena', 'Sethabutra, Piyaroj', 'Mahaisavariya, Punkae']","['Eimpunth S', 'Pattanaprichakul P', 'Sitthinamsuwa P', 'Chularojanamontri L', 'Sethabutra P', 'Mahaisavariya P']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120828,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Dermatomycoses/diagnosis', 'Erythema Nodosum/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leg/*pathology', 'Leiomyoma/diagnosis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Panniculitis/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial/diagnosis/microbiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Vasculitis, Leukocytoclastic, Cutaneous/diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/30 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2012/08/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-4632.2011.05394.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2013 May;52(5):560-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2011.05394.x.

We report here that miR290-5p (100049710) and miR292-5p (100049711) are induced at the pre-B stage of murine B cell development and that they influence assembly of the Igkappa light chain gene (243469) by contributing to the activation of germline Igkappa transcription (kappaGT). We found that upon forced over-expression of miR290-5p/292-5p in Abelson Murine Leukemia Virus (AMuLV) transformed pro-B cells, two known activators of kappaGT, E2A (21423) and NF-kappaB (19697), show increased chromosomal binding to the kappa intronic enhancer. Conversely, knockdown of miR290-5p/292-5p in AMuLV pro-B cells blunts drug-induced activation of kappaGT. Furthermore, miR290-5p/292-5p knockdown also diminishes kappaGT activation, but not Rag1/2 (19373, 19374) expression, in an IL-7 dependent primary pro-B cell culture system. In addition, we identified a deficiency in kappaGT induction in miR290 cluster knockout mice. We hypothesize that increased expression of miR290-5p and miR292-5p contributes to the induction of kappaGT at the pre-B stage of B cell development through increased binding of NF-kappaB and E2A to kappa locus regulatory sequences.","['Garcia, Patty B', 'Cai, Amie', 'Bates, Jamie G', 'Nolla, Hector', 'Schlissel, Mark S']","['Garcia PB', 'Cai A', 'Bates JG', 'Nolla H', 'Schlissel MS']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (MIRN290 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MIRN292 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism/virology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Loci/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Introns/genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043805 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-17955 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43805. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043805.

Rapid administration of antibiotics when fever develops can prevent progression to sepsis and shock, and serves as an important indicator of the quality of care in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. We analyzed factors associated with (1) Longer times from fever onset to hospital presentation/antibiotic treatment and (2) Sepsis and infection-related mortality. METHOD: This prospective cohort study included children aged 0-16 years with newly diagnosed acute leukemia treated at Benjamin Bloom Hospital, San Salvador. We interviewed parents/caregivers within one month of diagnosis and at the onset of each new febrile episode. Times from initial fever to first antibiotic administration and occurrence of sepsis and infection-related mortality were documented. FINDINGS: Of 251 children enrolled, 215 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (85.7%). Among 269 outpatient febrile episodes, median times from fever to deciding to seek medical care was 10.0 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0-20.0), and from decision to seek care to first hospital visit was 1.8 hours (IQR 1.0-3.0). Forty-seven (17.5%) patients developed sepsis and 7 (2.6%) died of infection. Maternal illiteracy was associated with longer time from fever to decision to seek care (P = 0.029) and sepsis (odds ratio [OR] 3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-8.63; P = 0.034). More infectious deaths occurred in those with longer travel time to hospital (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03-1.81; P = 0.031) and in families with an annual household income <US$2,000 (OR 13.90, 95% CI 1.62-119.10; P = 0.016). INTERPRETATION: Illiteracy, poverty, and longer travel times are associated with delays in assessment and treatment of fever and with sepsis and infectious mortality in pediatric leukemia. Providing additional education to high-risk families and staying at a nearby guest house during periods of neutropenia may decrease sepsis and infectious mortality.","['Gavidia, Ronald', 'Fuentes, Soad L', 'Vasquez, Roberto', 'Bonilla, Miguel', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Diorio, Caroline', 'Caniza, Miguela', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Gavidia R', 'Fuentes SL', 'Vasquez R', 'Bonilla M', 'Ethier MC', 'Diorio C', 'Caniza M', 'Howard SC', 'Sung L']","[""Pediatric Oncology, Benjamin Bloom National Children's Hospital, San Salvador, El Salvador.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'El Salvador/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fever/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Sepsis/complications/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', '*Social Class', 'Time Factors']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043639 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-10248 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43639. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043639.

This interaction is direct and requires the Rbm15 SPOC domain and the Setd1b LSD motif.

These cells exhibit enhanced proliferation and cytokine-independent cell growth, which requires an intact Rbm15 SPOC domain that mediates interaction between the Rbm15-Mkl1 fusion protein and the Setd1b methyltransferase.

METHODS: Patients enrolled on the St Jude ALL Total Therapy Study XV, which omitted prophylactic cranial irradiation in all patients, were assessed 120 weeks after completion of consolidation therapy (n = 243) using a comprehensive cognitive battery. chi(2) analysis was used to compare the percentage of below-average performers among the entire ALL patient group to the expected rate based on the normative sample. Univariate logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of intensity of chemotherapy (treatment arm), age at diagnosis, and sex on the probability of below-average performance. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Overall, the ALL group had a statistically significantly higher risk for below-average performance on a measure of sustained attention (67.31% more than 1 SD below the normative mean for omission errors, P < .001) but not on measures of intellectual functioning, academic skills, or memory. Patients given higher intensity chemotherapy were at greater risk for below-average performance compared with those given lower intensity therapy on measures of processing speed (27.14% vs 6.25%, P = .009) and academic abilities (Math Reasoning: 18.60% vs 3.90%, P = .008; Word Reading: 20.00% vs 2.60%, P = .007; Spelling: 27.91% vs 3.90%, P = .001) and had higher parent-reported hyperactivity (23.00% vs 9.84%, P = .018) and learning problems (35.00% vs 16.39%, P = .005).

CONCLUSIONS: Omitting cranial irradiation may help preserve global cognitive abilities, but treatment with chemotherapy alone is not without risks.

We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for an MLL split signal on 223 adult T-ALL samples obtained within the framework of the German Multicenter ALL 07/2003 therapy trial. Three biphenotypic leukemias (T-ALL/AML) were also included in the analysis. Samples showing any alteration by FISH were further investigated to characterize the MLL aberration. In addition, they were investigated for common genetic lesions known in T-ALL. Twenty-two cases (9.5%) showed an abnormal MLL signal by FISH analysis. Most of these appeared to be deletions or gains but in five cases (2.1%) a chromosomal translocation involving the MLL gene was identified. The translocation partners and chromosomal breakpoints were molecularly characterized. Three T-ALLs had an MLL-AF6/t(6;11) and two biphenotypic leukemias had an MLL-ELL/t(11;19). The chromosomal breakpoints in two of the MLL-AF6-positive cases were located outside the classical MLL major breakpoint cluster known from BCP ALL. In conclusion, the spectrum of MLL translocation partners in adult T-ALL much more resembles that of AML than that of BCP ALL and thus the mechanisms by which MLL contributes to leukemogenesis in adult T-ALL appear to differ from those in BCP ALL. Proposals are made for the diagnostic assessment of MLL fusion genes in adult T-ALL.","['Turkmen, Seval', 'Timmermann, Bernd', 'Bartels, Gesine', 'Groger, Daniela', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Rieder, Harald', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Burmeister, Thomas']","['Turkmen S', 'Timmermann B', 'Bartels G', 'Groger D', 'Meyer C', 'Schwartz S', 'Haferlach C', 'Rieder H', 'Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D', 'Marschalek R', 'Burmeister T']","['Labor Berlin, Abteilung Tumorzytogenetik, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120825,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.21996 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2012 Dec;51(12):1114-24. doi: 10.1002/gcc.21996.

We demonstrate that statins can impair FLT3 glycosylation, thus leading to loss of surface expression and induction of cell death, as well as mitigation of TKI resistance. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms a reduction in surface localization and an increase in intracellular FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) accumulation. This aberrant localization was associated with increased STAT5 activation but inhibition of both MAPK and AKT phosphorylation. Growth inhibition studies indicate that FLT3/ITD-expressing cells were killed with an IC(50) within a range of 0.2-2muM fluvastatin. Several mechanisms of resistance could be circumvented by fluvastatin treatment. An increase in the IC(50) for inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3/ITD by lestaurtinib caused by exogenous FLT3 ligand, resistance to sorafenib caused by the D835Y or FLT3/ITD N676K mutations, and activation of the IL-3 compensatory pathway were all negated by fluvastatin treatment. Finally, fluvastatin treatment in vivo reduced engraftment of BaF3 FLT3/ITD cells in Balb/c mice. These results demonstrate that statins, a class of drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, might be repurposed for the management of FLT3 mutant acute myeloid leukemia cases either alone or in conjunction with FLT3 TKI.","['Williams, Allen B', 'Li, Li', 'Nguyen, Bao', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Levis, Mark', 'Small, Donald']","['Williams AB', 'Li L', 'Nguyen B', 'Brown P', 'Levis M', 'Small D']","['Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120827,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '4L066368AS (Fluvastatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticholesteremic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fluvastatin', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46311-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-403493 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 11;120(15):3069-79. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-403493.

Little is known of possible variations in the levels of Pax5 expression and their influences on hematopoietic development. We have developed a retroviral transduction system that allows for the study of possible intermediate stages of this commitment by controlling the levels of Pax5 expressed in Pax5-deficient progenitors in vitro and in vivo. Retroviral transduction of Pax5-deficient pro-/pre-B cell lines with a doxycycline-inducible (TetON) form of the human Pax5 (huPax5) gene yielded cell clones that could be induced to different levels of huPax5 expression. Clones inducible to high levels developed B220(+)/CD19(+)/IgM(+) B cells, while clones with low levels differentiated to B220(+)/CD19(-)/CD11b(+)/Gr-1(-) B-lymphoid/myeloid biphenotypic cells in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analyses of genes expressed at these lower levels of huPax5 identified C/ebpalpha, C/ebpdelta, Pu.1, Csf1r, Csf2r, and Gata-3 as myeloid-related genes selectively expressed in the pro-/pre-B cells that can develop under myeloid/lymphoid conditions to biphenotypic cells. Therefore, reduced expression of huPax5 during the induction of early lymphoid progenitors to B-lineage-committed cells can fix this cellular development at a stage that has previously been seen during embryonic development and in acute lymphoblastic lymphoma-like biphenotypic acute leukemias.","['Simmons, Szandor', 'Knoll, Marko', 'Drewell, Christopher', 'Wolf, Ingrid', 'Mollenkopf, Hans-Joachim', 'Bouquet, Corinne', 'Melchers, Fritz']","['Simmons S', 'Knoll M', 'Drewell C', 'Wolf I', 'Mollenkopf HJ', 'Bouquet C', 'Melchers F']","['Lymphocyte Development Group, Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120827,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/01/03 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46203-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-414821 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 1;120(18):3688-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-414821.

We identified that these stimuli regulate apoptosis resistance by modulating sphingolipid metabolism. Applying liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we revealed a significant decrease of proapoptotic ceramide in BCR/IL-4/CD40L-stimulated primary CLL cells compared with untreated controls. Antiapoptotic glucosylceramide levels were significantly increased after BCR cross-linking. We identified BCR engagement to catalyze the crucial modification of ceramide to glucosylceramide via UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG). Besides specific UGCG inhibitors, our data demonstrate that IgM-mediated UGCG expression was inhibited by the novel and highly effective PI3Kdelta and BTK inhibitors CAL-101 and PCI-32765, which reverted IgM-induced resistance toward apoptosis of CLL cells. Sphingolipids were recently shown to be crucial for mediation of apoptosis via mitochondria. Our data reveal ABT-737, a mitochondria-targeting drug, as interesting candidate partner for PI3Kdelta and BTK inhibition, resulting in synergistic apoptosis, even under protection by the BCR. In summary, we identified the mode of action of novel kinase inhibitors CAL-101 and PCI-32765 by controlling the UGCG-mediated ceramide/glucosylceramide equilibrium as a downstream molecular switch of BCR signaling, also providing novel targeted treatment options beyond current chemotherapy-based regimens.","['Schwamb, Janine', 'Feldhaus, Valeska', 'Baumann, Michael', 'Patz, Michaela', 'Brodesser, Susanne', 'Brinker, Reinhild', 'Claasen, Julia', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Frenzel, Lukas P']","['Schwamb J', 'Feldhaus V', 'Baumann M', 'Patz M', 'Brodesser S', 'Brinker R', 'Claasen J', 'Pallasch CP', 'Hallek M', 'Wendtner CM', 'Frenzel LP']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120827,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucosylceramides)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glucosylceramides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53876-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-431783 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 8;120(19):3978-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-431783.

Here we show that short-term treatment with the p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-alpha partially and transiently rescued the myeloid and lymphoid abnormalities found in NHD13(+) Tg mice, with no improvement in the anemia, while the genetic deletion of 2 alleles of p53 rescued both the myeloid progenitor cell and long-term hematopoietic stem cell compartments. Nonetheless, loss of one or both alleles of p53 did not rescue the MDS phenotype, but instead exacerbated the MDS phenotype and accelerated the development of acute myeloid leukemia. Our studies suggest that while targeting p53 may transiently improve hematopoiesis in MDS, over the long-term, it has detrimental effects, raising caution about abrogating its function to treat the cytopenias that accompany this disease.","['Xu, Haiming', 'Menendez, Silvia', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Bae, Narae', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Deblasio, Tony R', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Xu H', 'Menendez S', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Bae N', 'Aplan PD', 'Gohring G', 'Deblasio TR', 'Nimer SD']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120827,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (NUP98-HOXD13 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', 'D213B92S1Y (pifithrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Toluene/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46313-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-405332 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 11;120(15):3089-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-405332.

DIAGNOSIS: Hypereosinophilia has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1,500/mm(3) and may be associated with tissue damage. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ-hybridization, flow immunocytometry, and T-cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic myeloid or lymphoproliferative disorder. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2008 World Health Organization establishes a semimolecular classification scheme of disease subtypes including ""myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1,"" chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified' (CEL, NOS), lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which is a diagnosis of exclusion. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (e.g., <1,500/mm(3) ) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close-follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and steroid-refractory cases of HES. In addition to hydroxyurea, second line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and hematopoietic cell transplant have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL with outcomes reported for limited numbers of patients. Although clinical trials have been performed with anti IL-5 (mepolizumab) and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) antibodies, their therapeutic role in primary eosinophilic diseases and HES has yet to be established.","['Gotlib, Jason']",['Gotlib J'],"['Division of Hematology, Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA. jason.gotlib@stanford.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Eosinophilia/classification/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'World Health Organization']",2012/08/29 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23293 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Sep;87(9):903-14. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23293.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

We recently showed the potential therapeutic benefit of the pegylated-human-arginase I (peg-Arg I) in T-ALL. However, the mechanisms by which peg-Arg I induces an anti-T-ALL effect remained unknown. Our results show the induction of T-ALL cell apoptosis by peg-Arg I, which associated with a global arrest in protein synthesis and with the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic-translation-initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha). Inhibition of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in T-ALL cells prevented the apoptosis induced by peg-Arg I, whereas the expression of a phosphomimetic eIF2alpha form increased the sensibility of T-ALL cells to peg-Arg I. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by peg-Arg I was mediated through kinases PERK and GCN2 and down-regulation of phosphatase GADD34. GCN2 and decreased GADD34 promoted T-ALL cell apoptosis after treatment with peg-Arg I, whereas PERK had an unexpected anti-apoptotic role. Additional results showed that phospho-eIF2alpha signaling further increased the anti-leukemic effects induced by peg-Arg I in T-ALL-bearing mice. These results suggest the central role of phospho-eIF2alpha in the anti-T-ALL effects induced by peg-Arg I and support its study as a therapeutic target.","['Morrow, K', 'Hernandez, C P', 'Raber, P', 'Del Valle, L', 'Wilk, A M', 'Majumdar, S', 'Wyczechowska, D', 'Reiss, K', 'Rodriguez, P C']","['Morrow K', 'Hernandez CP', 'Raber P', 'Del Valle L', 'Wilk AM', 'Majumdar S', 'Wyczechowska D', 'Reiss K', 'Rodriguez PC']","['Louisiana State University, Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120828,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (EIF2AK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arginase/*administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'eIF-2 Kinase/*metabolism']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012247 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.247 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):569-77. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.247.

In this study, we provide evidence that Mst1 loss in the mouse enhances chemically and genetically induced lymphoma development by inducing chromosomal instability. Mst1 deficiency increased susceptibility to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia induced by mutagen exposure. Notably, before transformation Mst1(-/-) normal thymocytes showed no changes in proliferation or apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, but they displayed elevated levels of abnormal mitotic chromosomes and aneuploidy, conditions known to promote tumorigenesis. Mst1(-/-) mice also showed accelerated formation of spontaneous lymphomas in a p53-deficient background, accompanied by severe aneuploidy. In clinical specimens of lymphoma and leukemia, we documented frequent downregulation of MST1 expression, consistent with our findings. Taken together, our findings reveal a tumor suppressive function of Mst1 based on its ability to prevent chromosomal instability in lymphocytes.","['Kim, Tae-Shin', 'Lee, Da-Hye', 'Kim, Sang Kyum', 'Shin, So Youn', 'Seo, Eul-Ju', 'Lim, Dae-Sik']","['Kim TS', 'Lee DH', 'Kim SK', 'Shin SY', 'Seo EJ', 'Lim DS']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Biological Sciences, National Creative Research Initiatives Center, Graduate School of Nanoscience and Technology (WCU), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120827,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Stk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomal Instability', '*Chromosomes', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*prevention & control', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/08/29 06:00,2012/12/27 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-3956 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3956 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Oct 15;72(20):5386-95. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3956.

MLL1 knockdown downregulated various growth and angiogenic factors, such as HIF1alpha, VEGF and CD31, in tumor tissue affecting tumor growth. MLL1 is overexpressed along the line of vascular network and localized adjacent to endothelial cell layer expressing CD31, indicating potential roles of MLL1 in vasculogenesis.

Among many other substrates BCR-ABL phosphorylates STAT5 and Src family kinases (SFK). Activated pSTAT5 is essential for initial transformation and maintenance of the disease. Cytokine-induced phosphorylation on tyrosine 694 typically leads to nuclear accumulation of pSTAT5 and target gene expression. We verified that in BCR-ABL-positive progenitor cells from a CML patient and in K562 cells pSTAT5 is cytoplasmic. However, upon ectopic expression of BCR-ABL p210 in non-myeloid cells, co-transfected STAT5A is phosphorylated on Y694 and localized in the nucleus arguing for an additional factor mediating cytoplasmic retention in CML cells. Expression of the SFK v-Src, Hck or Lyn together with STAT5A results in phosphorylation on Y694 and cytoplasmic retention. Upon coexpression of BCR-ABL and individual SFK the cytoplasmic retention of activated STAT5A mediated by v-Src and Hck but not Lyn is dominant over nuclear translocation induced by BCR-ABL. Cytoplasmic retention depends on the kinase activity of SFK and is mediated through the interaction of the SH2 domain of STAT5A with the SFK. Interestingly, nuclear accumulation of STAT5A as a result of activation by FLT3-ITD, an oncogene found in acute myeloid leukemia, cannot be prevented by coexpression of SFK. Importantly, inhibition of SFK in K562 cells restored nuclear accumulation of pSTAT5A, enhanced STAT5 target gene expression and increased colony formation. Thus, SFK mediate cytoplasmic retention of pSTAT5A in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Cytoplasmic pSTAT5A in CML cells might balance the controversial functions of STAT5 in cellular senescence and differentiation versus G1/S progression and survival.","['Chatain, N', 'Ziegler, P', 'Fahrenkamp, D', 'Jost, E', 'Moriggl, R', 'Schmitz-Van de Leur, H', 'Muller-Newen, G']","['Chatain N', 'Ziegler P', 'Fahrenkamp D', 'Jost E', 'Moriggl R', 'Schmitz-Van de Leur H', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie und Molekularbiologie, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120827,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012369 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.369 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Aug 1;32(31):3587-97. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.369.

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-two long term children survived leukaemia, aged from 8 to 15 years (27 females, 25 males; mean age 11.5 years) were evaluated for the possible effects of the anti-leukaemic therapy on dental development and compared to a control group of 52 healthy children (27 females, 25 males, mean age 11 years). All long-term children who survived were at least 24 months in continuous complete remission. The study of the dental status with a routine oral examination and panoramic radiographs was performed. The DMFT (recorded according to the WHO criteria) and dental anomalies were registered and evaluated. RESULTS: The results of this study evidence that long-term children survived leukaemia, in comparison with the control group, have an higher risk to develop dental caries and show a greater severity of dental anomalies including V-shaped roots, dental agenesis, microdontia, enamel dysplasias. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric patients with haemathological diseases require a special attentions in dental care in addition to the antineoplastic treatment. Therefore, oral hygiene and oral health can be maintained thanks to a close cooperation between the paediatric oncohaematologists, pediatrics dental surgeons and dental hygienists.","['Lauritano, Dorina', 'Petruzzi, Massimo']","['Lauritano D', 'Petruzzi M']",['Department of Neuroscience University of Milano - Bicocca - Italy'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121101,Spain,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",101231694,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*DMF Index', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Tooth Abnormalities/*epidemiology']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/04/30 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['17955 [pii]', '10.4317/medoral.17955 [doi]']",epublish,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal. 2012 Nov 1;17(6):e977-80. doi: 10.4317/medoral.17955.,PMC3505719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We linked California cancer and birth registries to obtain information on 5788 cases and 5788 controls matched on age and sex (1:1). We examined the association of birth weight, gestational age, birth and pregnancy order, parental ages, and specific conditions during pregnancy and risk of total leukemia, ALL and AML using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) per 1000 g increase in birth weight was 1.11 for both total leukemia and ALL. The OR were highest for babies weighing >/= 4500 g with reference < 2500 g: 1.59 (95% CI: 1.05-2.40) and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.08-2.68) for total leukemia and ALL, respectively. For AML, increase in risk was also observed but the estimate was imprecise due to small numbers. Compared to average-for-gestational age (AGA), large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies were at slightly increased risk of total childhood leukemia (OR = 1.10) and both ALL and AML (OR = 1.07 and OR = 1.13, respectively) but estimates were imprecise. Being small-for-gestational age (SGA) was associated with reduced risk of childhood leukemia (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97) and ALL (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94), but not AML. Being first-born was associated with decreased risk of AML only (OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53-0.93). Compared to children with paternal age <25 years, children with paternal age between 35 and 45 years were at increased risk of total childhood leukemia (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04-1.40) and ALL (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.04-1.47). None of conditions during pregnancy examined or maternal age were associated with increased risk of childhood leukemia or its subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high birth weight and LGA were associated with increased risk and SGA with decreased risk of total childhood leukemia and ALL, being first-born was associated with decreased risk of AML, and advanced paternal age was associated with increased risk of ALL. These findings suggest that associations of childhood leukemia and perinatal factors depend highly on subtype of leukemia.","['Oksuzyan, S', 'Crespi, C M', 'Cockburn, M', 'Mezei, G', 'Kheifets, L']","['Oksuzyan S', 'Crespi CM', 'Cockburn M', 'Mezei G', 'Kheifets L']","['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, United States. soksuzyan@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120825,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Birth Weight', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Registries']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(12)00111-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2012.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Dec;36(6):e359-65. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2012.08.002.

Following contusion injury to muscle, the cytokine leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) is up-regulated and knockout of Lif negatively impacts on morphometric parameters of muscle regeneration. Although it was speculated that LIF regulates muscle regeneration through direct effects on myogenic cells, the inflammatory effects of LIF have not been examined in regenerating skeletal muscle. Therefore, the expression and function of LIF was examined using the antagonist MH35-BD during specific inflammatory and myogenic stages of notexin-induced muscle regeneration in mice. LIF protein and mRNA were up-regulated in two distinct phases following intramuscular injection of notexin into tibialis anterior muscles. The first phase of LIF up-regulation coincided with the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines; the second phase coincided with myogenic differentiation and formation of new myotubes. Administration of the LIF receptor antagonist MH35-BD during the second phase of LIF up-regulation had no significant effects on transcript expression of genes required for myogenic differentiation or associated with inflammation; there were no significant differences in morphometric parameters of the regenerating muscle. Conversely, when MH35-BD was administered during the acute inflammatory phase, increased gene transcripts for the pro-inflammatory cytokines Tnf (Tumor necrosis factor), Il1b (Interleukin-1beta) and Il6 (Interleukin-6) alongside an increase in the number of Ly6G positive neutrophils infiltrating the muscle were observed. This was followed by a reduction in Myog (Myogenin) mRNA, which is required for myogenic differentiation, and the subsequent number of myotubes formed was significantly decreased in MH35-BD-treated groups compared to sham. Thus, antagonism of the LIF receptor during the inflammatory phase of skeletal muscle regeneration appeared to induce an inflammatory response that inhibited subsequent myotube formation. We propose that the predominant role of LIF in skeletal muscle regeneration appears to be in regulating the inflammatory response rather than directly effecting myogenic cells.","['Hunt, Liam C', 'Upadhyay, Aradhana', 'Jazayeri, Jalal A', 'Tudor, Elizabeth M', 'White, Jason D']","['Hunt LC', 'Upadhyay A', 'Jazayeri JA', 'Tudor EM', 'White JD']","['Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Flemington road, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Myog protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37223-96-4 (notexin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Elapid Venoms/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/prevention & control', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Muscle Development/drug effects', 'Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myogenin/genetics/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', '*Regeneration/drug effects', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00418-012-1018-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 2013 Jan;139(1):13-34. doi: 10.1007/s00418-012-1018-0.

Like other TNF family members, in vivo and in vitro activity of CD40L requires a homotrimeric configuration, and growing evidence suggests that bioactivity depends on higher-order clustering of CD40. We generated a novel formulation of human recombinant CD40L (CD40L-Tri) in which the CD40L extracellular domain and a trimerization motif are connected by a long flexible peptide linker. We demonstrate that CD40L-Tri significantly expands normal CD19+ B cells by over 20- to 30-fold over 14 days and induces B cells to become highly immunostimulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Consistent with these results, CD40L-Tri-activated B cells could effectively stimulate antigen-specific T responses (against the influenza M1 peptide) from normal volunteers. In addition, CD40L-Tri could induce malignant B cells to become effective APCs, such that tumor-directed immune responses could be probed. Together, our studies demonstrate the potent immune-stimulatory effects of CD40L-Tri on B cells that enable their expansion of antigen-specific human T cells. The potent bioactivity of CD40L-Tri is related to its ability to self-multimerize, which may be facilitated by its long peptide linker.","['Naito, Masayasu', 'Hainz, Ursula', 'Burkhardt, Ute E', 'Fu, Buyin', 'Ahove, Deborah', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Rajasagi, Mohini', 'Zhu, Baogong', 'Alonso, Anselmo', 'Witten, Elizabeth', 'Matsuoka, Ken-Ichi', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Duke-Cohan, Jonathan S', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Freeman, Gordon J']","['Naito M', 'Hainz U', 'Burkhardt UE', 'Fu B', 'Ahove D', 'Stevenson KE', 'Rajasagi M', 'Zhu B', 'Alonso A', 'Witten E', 'Matsuoka K', 'Neuberg D', 'Duke-Cohan JS', 'Wu CJ', 'Freeman GJ']","['Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120825,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (M1 protein, Influenza A virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/immunology']",2012/08/29 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1331-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2013 Feb;62(2):347-57. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1331-4.

Cancer cells that use the ALT pathway exhibit distinct phenotypes such as heterogeneous telomeres and specialised Promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear foci called APBs. In our study, we used wild-type PML and a PML mutant, in which the coiled-coil domain is deleted (PML C/C-), to investigate how these proteins can affect telomere maintenance pathways in cancer cells that use either the telomerase or ALT pathway. RESULTS: Stable over-expression of both types of PML does not affect the telomere maintenance in the ALT cells. We report novel observations in PML over-expressed telomerase-positive MCF7 cells: 1) APBs are detected in telomerase-positive MCF7 cells following over-expression of wild-type PML and 2) rapid telomere elongation is observed in MCF7 cells that stably express either wild-type PML or PML C/C-. We also show that the telomerase activity in MCF7 cells can be affected depending on the type of PML protein over-expressed. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that APBs might not be essential for the ALT pathway as MCF7 cells that do not contain APBs exhibit long telomeres. We propose that wild-type PML can either definitively dominate over telomerase or enhance the activity of telomerase, and PML C/C- can allow for the co-existence of both telomerase and ALT pathways. Our findings add another dimension in the study of telomere maintenance as the expression of PML alone (wild-type or otherwise) is able to change the dynamics of the telomerase pathway.","['Yong, Jacklyn W Y', 'Yeo, Xiujun', 'Khan, Md Matiullah', 'Lee, Martin B', 'Hande, M Prakash']","['Yong JW', 'Yeo X', 'Khan MM', 'Lee MB', 'Hande MP']","['Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117597, Singapore. phsmph@nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120827,England,Genome Integr,Genome integrity,101534214,,,,2012/08/29 06:00,2012/08/29 06:01,['2012/08/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:01 [medline]']","['2041-9414-3-5 [pii]', '10.1186/2041-9414-3-5 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Integr. 2012 Aug 27;3(1):5. doi: 10.1186/2041-9414-3-5.,PMC3447653,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant methylation of ALOX12 was associated with the subcategory AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P = 0.0439) and specifically with megakaryocytic dysplasia (P = 0.0003). An association between HS3ST2 and AML patients with favourable cytogenetic risk was identified (P = 0.0469). In univariate and multivariate analysis, methylation of GSTM1 was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), with hazard ratios of 2.57 and 1.86, respectively. Furthermore, the significance of methylation of GSTM1 in predicting poor prognosis was maintained within the subcategories of AML not otherwise specified (NOS), AML with intermediate cytogenetic risk and normal karyotype AML. Finally, patients with both GSTM1 and ALOX12 methylated, demonstrated worse outcomes when all AML patients were assessed (OS; P = 0.000411) as well as within AML NOS (DFS; P = 0.0023), AML with intermediate cytogenetic risk (OS; P = 0.0104) and normal karyotype AML (OS; P = 0.00636). This study implicates methylation of specific genes in the classification and prognostication of AML and suggests that the morphological feature of multilineage dysplasia may be a surrogate marker of gene methylation in at least a subset of AML cases.","['Ohgami, Robert S', 'Ma, Lisa', 'Ren, Li', 'Weinberg, Olga K', 'Seetharam, Mahesh', 'Gotlib, Jason R', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Ohgami RS', 'Ma L', 'Ren L', 'Weinberg OK', 'Seetharam M', 'Gotlib JR', 'Arber DA']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120828,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (FZD9 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.31.

The compound has many biological properties, including antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antitumor activities. This review focuses on the in vitro antileukemic effects of purified hyperforin and related mechanisms in chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - conditions that are known for their resistance to chemotherapy. Hyperforin induces apoptosis in both CLL and AML cells. In AML cell lines and primary AML cells, hyperforin directly inhibits the kinase activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase B/AKT1, leading to activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bad through its non-phosphorylation by AKT1. In primary CLL cells, hyperforin acts by stimulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Noxa (possibly through the inhibition of proteasome activity). Other hyperforin targets include matrix metalloproteinase-2 in AML cells and vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in CLL cells - two mediators of cell migration and angiogenesis. In summary, hyperforin targets molecules involved in signaling pathways that control leukemic cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis. Hyperforin also downregulates the expression of P-glycoprotein, a protein that is involved in the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

Using Affymetrix SNP arrays we found large regions of LOH in 16 of the cases. Eight cases (42%) demonstrated LOH at 5q and/or 7, which is a known marker of complex karyotypic changes and poor prognosis. In accordance with literature data, the overall survival for these patients was significantly shorter as compared to patients without this alteration (P=0,014).

The proposed model consists of two stages: first, the well-known minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (mRMR) method is applied to preselect genes that have the highest relevance with the target class and are maximally dissimilar to each other. Then, PSO is proposed to form a novel weighted SVM (WSVM) to classify samples. In this WSVM, PSO not only discards redundant genes, but also especially takes into account the degree of importance of each gene and assigns diverse weights to the different genes. We also use PSO to find appropriate kernel parameters since the choice of gene weights influences the optimal kernel parameters and vice versa. Experimental results show that the proposed mRMR-PSO-WSVM model achieves highest classification accuracy on two popular leukemia and colon gene expression datasets obtained from DNA microarrays. Therefore, we can conclude that our proposed method is very promising compared to the previously reported results.","['Abdi, Mohammad Javad', 'Hosseini, Seyed Mohammad', 'Rezghi, Mansoor']","['Abdi MJ', 'Hosseini SM', 'Rezghi M']","['Department of Computer Sciences, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, P.O.

Neurological syndromes can be seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mostly present as either leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of combined sensory-motor neuropathy, myopathy, and dermatitis in a patient with CLL. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old African American man presented with acute dysphagia, rapidly progressive proximal limb-girdle weakness, and dermatitis. He had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14,600/mm(3), hemoglobin of 11.4 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 165,000/mm(3). Lymphocytes comprised 15% of the total WBC with an absolute lymphocyte count of 2100/mm(3). Metabolic profile was unremarkable except for a serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level of 1056 mg/dL. Serum protein electrophoresis, serologic studies for autoimmune, genetic diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes were all negative. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed sensorimotor neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating features. Muscle biopsy revealed discrete areas of interstitial fibrosis juxtaposed to areas of intact muscle without any inflammation. At that point, a bone marrow biopsy was done because of anemia and slightly elevated mean corpuscular volume of 103. Bone marrow biopsy revealed minimal involvement with CD5/CD19-positive CLL. Flow cytometry demonstrated monoclonal CD5/CD19/CD20/CD23-positive cells, with dim kappa expression, and negative FMC-7 and CD3. This case doesn't meet the criteria for CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma. However, considering the possibility of paraneoplastic phenomenon for his symptoms, it was decided to start the patient on CLL-directed therapy with Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide. After only two cycles, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in his muscle strength with disappearance of the rash. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a unique clinical picture of inflammatory dermatitis with electromyography and biopsy findings suggestive of myopathy and combined sensorimotor neuropathy with response to CLL-directed therapy. Also the symptoms started before peripheral lymphocytosis which masked the diagnosis for over a year.","['Hassan, Samer', 'Popalzai, Muhammad', 'Yu, Edward', 'Wrzolek, Monika', 'Odaimi, Marcel']","['Hassan S', 'Popalzai M', 'Yu E', 'Wrzolek M', 'Odaimi M']","['Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20120731,New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,,,2012/08/28 06:00,2012/08/28 06:01,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJGM.S32993 [doi]', 'ijgm-5-647 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Gen Med. 2012;5:647-53. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S32993.

Interactions between resveratrol and pan-HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) were examined in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Pharmacologically achievable resveratrol concentrations (25-50 muM) synergistically potentiated HDACI lethality in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. Resveratrol antagonized RelA acetylation and NF-kappaB activation in HDACI-treated cells. However, short hairpin RNA Sirt1 knockdown failed to modify HDACI sensitivity, which suggests that factors other than or in addition to Sirt1 activation contribute to resveratrol/HDACI interactions. These interactions were associated with death receptor 5 (DR5) up-regulation and caspase-8 activation, whereas cells expressing dominant-negative caspase-8 were substantially protected from resveratrol/HDACI treatment, which suggests a significant functional role for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in lethality. Exposure to resveratrol with HDACI induced sustained reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was accompanied by increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks, as reflected in gammaH2A.X and comet assays. The free radical scavenger Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride blocked ROS generation, DR5 up-regulation, caspase-8 activation, DNA damage, and apoptosis, which indicates a primary role for oxidative injury in lethality. Analyses of cell-cycle progression and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation through flow cytometry revealed that resveratrol induced S-phase accumulation; this effect was abrogated by HDACI coadministration, which suggests that cells undergoing DNA synthesis may be particularly vulnerable to HDACI lethality. Collectively, these findings indicate that resveratrol interacts synergistically with HDACIs in AML cells through multiple ROS-dependent actions, including death receptor up-regulation, extrinsic apoptotic pathway activation, and DNA damage induction. They also raise the possibility that S-phase cells may be particularly susceptible to these actions.","['Yaseen, Alae', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Hock, Stefanie', 'Rosato, Roberto', 'Dent, Paul', 'Dai, Yun', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yaseen A', 'Chen S', 'Hock S', 'Rosato R', 'Dent P', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, P.O.

To understand the leukemogenic chromatin signature, we analyzed acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of leukemia characterized by the expression of RARalpha-fusion proteins, such as PML-RARalpha. We used nuclease accessibility sequencing in cell lines as well as patient blasts to identify accessible DNA elements and identified > 100 000 accessible regions in each case. Using ChIP-seq, we identified H2A.Z as a histone modification generally associated with these accessible regions, whereas unsupervised clustering analysis of other chromatin features, including DNA methylation, H2A.Zac, H3ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and the regulatory factor p300, distinguished 6 distinct clusters of accessible sites, each with a characteristic functional makeup. Of these, PML-RARalpha binding was found specifically at accessible chromatin regions characterized by p300 binding and hypoacetylated histones. Identifying regions with a similar epigenetic make up in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, another subtype of AMLs, revealed that these regions are occupied by the oncofusion protein AML1-ETO. Together, our results suggest that oncofusion proteins localize to accessible regions and that chromatin accessibility together with p300 binding and histone acetylation characterize AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha binding sites.","['Saeed, Sadia', 'Logie, Colin', 'Francoijs, Kees-Jan', 'Frige, Gianmaria', 'Romanenghi, Mauro', 'Nielsen, Fiona G', 'Raats, Lianne', 'Shahhoseini, Maryam', 'Huynen, Martijn', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G']","['Saeed S', 'Logie C', 'Francoijs KJ', 'Frige G', 'Romanenghi M', 'Nielsen FG', 'Raats L', 'Shahhoseini M', 'Huynen M', 'Altucci L', 'Minucci S', 'Martens JH', 'Stunnenberg HG']","['Radboud University, Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120824,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*physiology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46310-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-386086 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 11;120(15):3058-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-386086.

We examined the effect of HLA-DP genetic variation on risk and evaluated its potential interaction with 4 proxies for early immune modulation, including measures of infectious exposures in infancy (presence of older siblings, daycare attendance, ear infections) and breastfeeding. A total of 585 ALL cases and 848 controls were genotyped at the HLA-DPA1 and DPB1 loci. Because of potential heterogeneity in effect by race/ethnicity, we included only non-Hispanic white (47%) and Hispanic (53%) children and considered these 2 groups separately in the analysis. Logistic regression analyses showed an increased risk of ALL associated with HLA-DPB1*01:01 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.43, 95% CI, 1.01-2.04) with no heterogeneity by Hispanic ethnicity (P = .969). Analyses of DPB1 supertypes showed a marked childhood ALL association with DP1, particularly for high-hyperdiploid ALL (OR = 1.83; 95% CI, 1.20-2.78). Evidence of interaction was found between DP1 and older sibling (P = .036), and between DP1 and breastfeeding (P = .094), with both showing statistically significant DP1 associations within the lower exposure categories only. These findings support an immune mechanism in the etiology of childhood ALL involving the HLA-DPB1 gene in the context of an insufficiently modulated immune system.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Barcellos, Lisa F', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Taylor, Malcolm', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Moonsamy, Priscilla', 'Erlich, Henry A', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Urayama KY', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Metayer C', 'Ma X', 'Selvin S', 'Barcellos LF', 'Wiemels JL', 'Wiencke JK', 'Taylor M', 'Brennan P', 'Dahl GV', 'Moonsamy P', 'Erlich HA', 'Trachtenberg E', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. kurayama@luke.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120824,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-DP alpha-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPA1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DP alpha-Chains/*genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains/*genetics', 'Hispanic or Latino/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Factors', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Whites/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46308-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-404723 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 11;120(15):3039-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-404723.

We investigated whether this holds true in other diseases and in HLA-C allele-mismatched patients. Twenty-four myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 39 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/CML, and 34 acute lymphoblastic leukemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients received unrelated unmanipulated PBPC. HLA matching was analyzed retrospectively (including DNA-based direct sequencing of HLA-C). Only in AML/CML, the C2 ligand was associated with impaired overall survival (OS, p < 0.05). We next calculated the impact of donor/recipient HLA-C allele matching within the C1 and C2 groups. Surprisingly, AML/CML and MDS patients with C2 ligands profited from HLA-C allele mismatching (OS, p < 0.01), whereas in the C1 group, allele matching was beneficial (p < 0.05). HLA-C allele mismatching in the C2 KIR ligand group was associated with lower TRM (OR 0.48, p < 0.009) and lower relapse rate (OR 2.7 p < 0.1) when compared to allele-matched C2 patients. Thus, patients could be assigned to a low- and a high-risk group according to their C1/C2 ligand status and the HLA-C allele matching degree. These data suggest that four-digit allele matching of HLA-C has differential effects dependent on the presence of C1 and C2 KIR epitopes in the patient.","['Fischer, Johannes C', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Enczmann, Jurgen', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Uhrberg, Markus']","['Fischer JC', 'Kobbe G', 'Enczmann J', 'Haas R', 'Uhrberg M']","['Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany. fischer@itz.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120826,United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/surgery', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/transplantation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/mortality/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/surgery', 'Receptors, KIR/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00251-012-0648-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2012 Dec;64(12):879-85. doi: 10.1007/s00251-012-0648-7.

The objective of this study was to determine whether neighborhood- (nSES) and/or individual-level SES (iSES) also predicted current quality of life in adolescent and young adult survivors. METHODS: The Socioeconomics and Quality of Life study surveyed adolescent and young adult survivors of leukemia and lymphoma at least one year post-diagnosis using population-based ascertainment. Factor analysis was used to create a multidimensional age-relevant iSES score and compared with a preexisting census-block-group derived nSES score. Four quality of life domains were assessed: physical health, psychological and emotional well-being, social relationships, and life skills. Nested multivariable linear regression models were run to test the associations between both SES measures and quality of life and to compare the explanatory power of nSES and iSES. RESULTS: Data from 110 individuals aged 16-40 were included in the final analysis. After adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, low nSES was associated only with poorer physical health, whereas low iSES was related to poorer quality of life in all four domains with iSES accounting for an additional 14, 12, 25, and 10 % of the variance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of SES at the individual as compared to the neighborhood level may be stronger indicators of outcomes in adolescents and young adults, which has important implications for SES measurement in the context of cancer surveillance.","['Kent, Erin E', 'Sender, Leonard S', 'Morris, Rebecca A', 'Grigsby, Timothy J', 'Montoya, Michael J', 'Ziogas, Argyrios', 'Anton-Culver, Hoda']","['Kent EE', 'Sender LS', 'Morris RA', 'Grigsby TJ', 'Montoya MJ', 'Ziogas A', 'Anton-Culver H']","['Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 6116 Executive Blvd, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

METHODS: A double-blind comparative study of patients treated with PRED and DEX was performed. Sixteen patients received PRED (40 mg/m(2)/day) and 13 patients received DEX (6 mg/m(2)/day), both for 28 days. A low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone test (1.0 microg/m(2), IV) was performed before and weekly for 8 weeks after abrupt cessation of glucocorticoid therapy. Sixteen children without ALL were used as controls to determine the cutoff peak cortisol level (14.2 microg/dl). RESULTS: Both groups (PRED and DEX) displayed similar mean peak cortisol levels before treatment and during the 8 weeks of evaluation (p = 0.652). No relationship was observed between the incidence of infection/stress and peak cortisol level within each group, nor was there a difference in the frequency of infection/stress between groups (p = 0.359). Although the patients presented variations in peak cortisol during the study period, no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients who received PRED or DEX for 4 weeks showed similar adrenal reserves and infection rates for 8 weeks after abruptly stopping glucocorticoid therapy, suggesting that DEX, which is a better antileukemic drug than PRED, has similar adrenal suppression and recovery rates.","['Kuperman, Hilton', 'Odone Filho, Vicente', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Assis de Almeida, Maria Tereza', 'Setian, Nuvarte', 'Damiani, Durval']","['Kuperman H', 'Odone Filho V', 'Cristofani LM', 'Assis de Almeida MT', 'Setian N', 'Damiani D']","['Pediatric Endocrine Unit, Instituto da Crianca, Pediatrics Department, Sao Paulo University Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil. hkuperman@terra.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120821,Switzerland,Horm Res Paediatr,Hormone research in paediatrics,101525157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Glands/*metabolism', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*blood', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['000339830 [pii]', '10.1159/000339830 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res Paediatr. 2012;78(2):73-80. doi: 10.1159/000339830.

With age, the functional quality of HSCs declines, partly owing to the accumulation of damaged DNA. However, the factors that damage DNA and the protective mechanisms that operate in these cells are poorly understood. We have recently shown that the Fanconi anaemia DNA-repair pathway counteracts the genotoxic effects of reactive aldehydes. Mice with combined inactivation of aldehyde catabolism (through Aldh2 knockout) and the Fanconi anaemia DNA-repair pathway (Fancd2 knockout) display developmental defects, a predisposition to leukaemia, and are susceptible to the toxic effects of ethanol-an exogenous source of acetaldehyde. Here we report that aged Aldh2(-/-) Fancd2(-/-) mutant mice that do not develop leukaemia spontaneously develop aplastic anaemia, with the concomitant accumulation of damaged DNA within the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool. Unexpectedly, we find that only HSPCs, and not more mature blood precursors, require Aldh2 for protection against acetaldehyde toxicity. Additionally, the aldehyde-oxidizing activity of HSPCs, as measured by Aldefluor stain, is due to Aldh2 and correlates with this protection. Finally, there is more than a 600-fold reduction in the HSC pool of mice deficient in both Fanconi anaemia pathway-mediated DNA repair and acetaldehyde detoxification. Therefore, the emergence of bone marrow failure in Fanconi anaemia is probably due to aldehyde-mediated genotoxicity restricted to the HSPC pool. These findings identify a new link between endogenous reactive metabolites and DNA damage in HSCs, and define the protective mechanisms that counteract this threat.","['Garaycoechea, Juan I', 'Crossan, Gerry P', 'Langevin, Frederic', 'Daly, Maria', 'Arends, Mark J', 'Patel, Ketan J']","['Garaycoechea JI', 'Crossan GP', 'Langevin F', 'Daly M', 'Arends MJ', 'Patel KJ']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120826,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Fancd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Mutagens)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (ALDH2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial)', 'GO1N1ZPR3B (Acetaldehyde)']",IM,"['Acetaldehyde/metabolism/toxicity', 'Aging', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial', 'Aldehydes/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Repair', 'Ethanol/toxicity', 'Fanconi Anemia/pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/deficiency/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagens/*toxicity']",2012/08/28 06:00,2012/11/13 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['nature11368 [pii]', '10.1038/nature11368 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2012 Sep 27;489(7417):571-5. doi: 10.1038/nature11368.

Using high-resolution 450K arrays, we provide the most comprehensive DNA methylation study of CLL to date, analyzing paired diagnostic/follow-up samples from IGHV-mutated/untreated and IGHV-unmutated/treated patients (n=36) and patient-matched peripheral blood and lymph node samples (n=20). On an unprecedented scale, we revealed 2239 differentially methylated CpG sites between IGHV-mutated and unmutated patients, with the majority of sites positioned outside annotated CpG islands. Intriguingly, CLL prognostic genes (for example, CLLU1, LPL, ZAP70 and NOTCH1), epigenetic regulator (for example, HDAC9, HDAC4 and DNMT3B), B-cell signaling (for example, IBTK) and numerous TGF-beta and NF-kappaB/TNF pathway genes were alternatively methylated between subgroups. Contrary, DNA methylation over time was deemed rather stable with few recurrent changes noted within subgroups.

The cytogenetic and molecular responses of 189 CML patients were analyzed. Of this group, 121 patients were classified as the early chronic phase (ECP) group and started IM within 12 months of diagnosis. The other 68 patients were classified as the late chronic phase (LCP) group who had been treated with interferon (IFN)-alpha-2 and crossed over to IM more than 12 months after diagnosis. The overall rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at last follow-up were 83.6 and 78.1% in the ECP and LCP groups, respectively. The CCyR rates were 89.3 (for ECP patients) versus 73.5% (for LCP patients; p < 0.0001). At last follow-up, 82.4% ECP and 64.2% LCP patients had achieved an MMR (p < 0.0001). No significant differences were noted between the two groups with regard to survival outcomes. Our experience reveals that IM is an effective rescue therapy in most CML LCP patients who are intolerant or in whom IFN-alpha therapy fails.

We investigated the effects of PDCD2 knockdown on the development and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). CD34(+) cells derived from normal human bone marrow and K562 leukemic cells were effectively transduced with short-hairpin RNA to knockdown PDCD2. Colony-forming assays were used to investigate the effects of PDCD2 loss on HPC clonogenic potential and on 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-and arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced terminal differentiation. In CD34(+) clonogenic progenitors, PDCD2 knockdown decreased the total number of colony-forming units, increased the number of colony-forming units-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte and burst-forming unit-erythroid primitive colonies, and decreased the number of burst-forming unit-erythroid mature colonies. Similar results were observed in K562 cells, suggesting that PDCD2 is important for HPC differentiation and/or survival, and for erythroid lineage commitment. Furthermore, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-induced megakaryocytic differentiation and proliferation of K562 cells was not affected by PDCD2 knockdown. In contrast, arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was significantly reduced with PDCD2 knockdown, with no effect on cell proliferation. The effects of PDCD2 knockdown were attributed to a cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1), along with increased messenger RNA expression of early progenitor factors c-MYB and GATA-2, and decreased expression of erythroid factors GATA-1, EpoR, and gamma-globin. We conclude that PDCD2 loss of function(s) impedes erythroid differentiation by inducing cell cycle arrest and increasing expression of early hematopoietic progenitor factors. These findings suggest that PDCD2 has a novel regulatory role in human hematopoiesis and is essential for erythroid development.","['Kokorina, Natalia A', 'Granier, Celine J', 'Zakharkin, Stanislav O', 'Davis, Stephani', 'Rabson, Arnold B', 'Sabaawy, Hatem E']","['Kokorina NA', 'Granier CJ', 'Zakharkin SO', 'Davis S', 'Rabson AB', 'Sabaawy HE']","['The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (PDCD2 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2011/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00345-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Dec;40(12):1028-1042.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.08.004.

In this study we analyzed the gene expression profile in correlation with the profile of ex vivo resistance to etoposide in children with acute leukemias. METHODS: The ex vivo drug resistance profile was determined by the MTT cytotoxicity assay performed on leukemic blasts of 56 patients. Gene expression profiles were obtained from the results of hybridization of cRNA to Human Genome U133A 2.0 ologonucleotide arrays. The following analyses were performed: correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering, the assignment of location and function. Verification of data for four selected genes (MNDA, GH1, NUDT21, RHOG) was performed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction in the studied population and in an independent group of 54 leukemic patients. RESULTS: Using the permutation Spearman correlation test, a set of 233 probes/209 genes was selected. The global test confirmed the significance of the correlation of gene expression profile and resistance to etoposide (p<0.001). The NUDT21 (nudix, nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type, motif 21) gene showed the strongest correlation with resistance to etoposide (FDR<0.0001%). CONCLUSIONS: Profiling of transcriptome may help in assessing the sensitivity to drugs used in chemotherapy. Resistance to etoposide is possibly associated with a change of expression of a large number of biologically important genes that influence several cellular mechanisms.","['Szczepanek, Joanna', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Tretyn, Andrzej', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Szczepanek J', 'Styczynski J', 'Tretyn A', 'Pogorzala M', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland. szczepanekjoanna@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120619,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor)', '0 (GH2 protein, human)', '0 (MNDA protein, human)', '0 (Nudt21 protein, human)', '0 (Placental Hormones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147605-13-8 (RHOG protein, human)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Growth Hormone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Placental Hormones/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptome', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/05/03 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1000903 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1000903 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2012 Jun 19;66:401-8. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1000903.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A first-in-human study evaluated safety, dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of SF1126, in patients with advanced solid and B-cell malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SF1126 was administered IV days 1 and 4, weekly in 28day-cycles. Dose escalation utilised modified Fibonacci 3+3. Samples to monitor PK and PD were obtained. RESULTS: Forty four patients were treated at 9 dose levels (90-1110 mg/m(2)/day). Most toxicity was grade 1 and 2 with a single DLT at180 mg/m(2) (diarrhoea). Exposure measured by peak concentration (C(max)) and area under the time-concentration curve (AUC(0-)(t)) was dose proportional. Stable disease (SD) was the best response in 19 of 33 (58%) evaluable patients. MTD was not reached but the maximum administered dose (MAD) was 1110 mg/m(2). The protocol was amended to enrol patients with CD20+ B-cell malignancies at 1110 mg/m(2). A CLL patient who progressed on rituximab [R] achieved SD after 2 months on SF1126 alone but in combination with R achieved a 55% decrease in absolute lymphocyte count and a lymph node response. PD studies of CLL cells demonstrated SF1126 reduced p-AKT and increased apoptosis indicating inhibition of activated PI3K signalling. CONCLUSION: SF1126 is well tolerated with SD as the best response in patients with advanced malignancies.","['Mahadevan, D', 'Chiorean, E G', 'Harris, W B', 'Von Hoff, D D', 'Stejskal-Barnett, A', 'Qi, W', 'Anthony, S P', 'Younger, A E', 'Rensvold, D M', 'Cordova, F', 'Shelton, C F', 'Becker, M D', 'Garlich, J R', 'Durden, D L', 'Ramanathan, R K']","['Mahadevan D', 'Chiorean EG', 'Harris WB', 'Von Hoff DD', 'Stejskal-Barnett A', 'Qi W', 'Anthony SP', 'Younger AE', 'Rensvold DM', 'Cordova F', 'Shelton CF', 'Becker MD', 'Garlich JR', 'Durden DL', 'Ramanathan RK']","['University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA. dmahadevan@westclinic.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120823,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SF 1126)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Chromones/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hypokalemia/chemically induced', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Salvage Therapy', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(12)00564-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2012.06.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Dec;48(18):3319-27. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2012.06.027.

Consequently, MLL-rearranged ALL cells respond well to demethylating cytosine analogue drugs. In human cancer cells, enhanced promoter methylation is typically accompanied by global loss of methylation in non-promoter regions of the genome. In turn, global hypomethylation usually leads to genomic instability, which may have contributed to cancer development. DESIGN AND METHODS: Here we examined global methylation densities in MLL-rearranged infant ALL (n=45) samples in comparison with germline MLL infant ALL (n=11), non-infant B-cell precursor ALL (n=11) and normal paediatric bone marrow (n=9) samples. For this we performed high-resolution bisulfite pyrosequencing to determine methylation levels at the repetitive elements LINE-1, Alu and satellite alpha (SAT-alpha). As an additional measure of global methylation levels we used the LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA). RESULTS: We found that MLL-rearranged infant ALL is not characterised by global hypomethylation, despite its characteristic promoter CpG hypermethylation patterns. Instead we observed a moderate trend towards global hypermethylation and demonstrated that these methylated non-promoter sequences are responsive to demethylating agents. CONCLUSIONS: MLL-rearranged infant ALL cells are characterised by an overall methylated genomic state, and both promoter and non-promoter methylation responds to demethylating agents, which may further explain the remarkable sensitivity of these cells for the methylation-inhibiting therapeutics.","['Stumpel, Dominique J P M', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'van Roon, Eddy H J', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['Stumpel DJ', 'Schneider P', 'van Roon EH', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Room: Ee15-14a, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120823,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)'],IM,"['DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(12)00574-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2012.07.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2013 Jan;49(1):175-84. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2012.07.013.

Euphohelioscopin A also inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of the myeloid leukemia cell lines THP-1 and HL-60.

In order to understand present-day positions and peculiarities in any field of human endeavor, familiarity with the past is essential. Those of us who study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or care for patients diagnosed with these troublesome conditions may wonder also how the current state of affairs evolved with respect to our narrow area of focus, and how we know what we think we know now about these still-enigmatic bone marrow diseases. Here, I review a number of developments that collectively represent a brief ""history of MDS."" I first highlight a few landmark observations that preceded any concept of MDS by hundreds of years. Twentieth-century case descriptions and series with hypotheses about the etiology and nature of disorders described as ""refractory anemia"", ""preleukemia"", and with other terminology culminated in the efforts of the French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group of morphologists, whose landmark 1976 and 1982 papers provided the first widely-used classification of MDS. More recent developments in the MDS field include new mechanistic biological insights, regulatory approval of several somewhat-effective treatments, and improved organizational support and advocacy. The history of a disease concept like MDS, as for history in general, provides both inspiration and cautionary tales that can inform present and future work.","['Steensma, David P']",['Steensma DP'],"['Adult Leukemia Program, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Boston, MA, USA. david_steensma@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20120823,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*history/pathology/therapy', 'Terminology as Topic']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00340-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Dec;36(12):1441-52. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.08.007.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between copper and hematological malignancies. METHODS: 84 patients with hematological diseases were studied, along with 50 healthy individuals. Copper was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The patients were classified to 2 homogeneous groups, acute and chronic hematological neoplasms, respectively. For the patients with acute hematological malignancies, relapse and remission were investigated in relation to serum copper levels. For chronic hematological neoplasms, serum copper was connected either with stable or progressive disease. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) and CD38 expression, along with the unmutated VH immunoglobulin genes (IgVH) status were also determined for the 22 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. RESULTS: 54 patients with relapse or progressive disease had elevated copper levels (mean value 1.8 mg/l), whereas 30 patients either in remission or in stable disease had normal copper levels (mean value 1.01 mg/l) (normal range 0.8-1.3mg/l). CONCLUSION: Hence, our study indicates that serum elevated copper levels are associated with hematological malignancies either in relapse or in disease progression, whereas normal copper levels are linked with hematological neoplasms in remission or in stable disease. Furthermore, we report for the first time an association between high serum copper levels and several adverse prognostic markers in CLL, such as increased expression of ZAP70 and CD38, along with elevated percentage of unmutated IgVH.","['Kaiafa, Georgia D', 'Saouli, Zoi', 'Diamantidis, Michael D', 'Kontoninas, Zisis', 'Voulgaridou, Virginia', 'Raptaki, Maria', 'Arampatzi, Stergiani', 'Chatzidimitriou, Maria', 'Perifanis, Vasilios']","['Kaiafa GD', 'Saouli Z', 'Diamantidis MD', 'Kontoninas Z', 'Voulgaridou V', 'Raptaki M', 'Arampatzi S', 'Chatzidimitriou M', 'Perifanis V']","['Department of Haematology, First Propedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120821,Netherlands,Eur J Intern Med,European journal of internal medicine,9003220,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Copper/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0953-6205(12)00201-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejim.2012.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Intern Med. 2012 Dec;23(8):738-41. doi: 10.1016/j.ejim.2012.07.009.

We examined: (1) the expression profiles of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and their protein content in the endometrium of cyclic and pregnant gilts on Days 10 to 18 after estrus; (2) the effect of conceptus-exposed medium on LIF and IL-6 synthesis in the endometrium; (3) the profiles of IL6R and LIFR mRNA expression in pig conceptuses collected on Days 10 to 18 of pregnancy; and (4) the effect of LIF and IL-6 on the attachment and proliferation of porcine trophoblast cells. The expression of LIF mRNA in the endometrium increased between Days 10 and 12 in both cyclic and pregnant gilts, and tended to be higher in Day 12 pregnant animals compared with nonpregnant ones. The LIF protein content in the uterine lumen peaked on Day 12 of pregnancy, and was higher than on Day 12 of the estrous cycle. Endometrial IL-6 mRNA expression was upregulated on Day 12 in pregnant gilts compared with nonpregnant animals. Moreover, a higher content of IL-6 protein was observed in pregnant than in cyclic gilts. The addition of conceptus-exposed medium resulted in up-regulation of LIF and IL6 mRNA expression, and increased IL-6 content in endometrial slices. In conceptuses, increased mRNA expression was detected on Days 10 to 14 for IL6R and on Day 14 for LIFR, when compared with other days studied. LIF and IL-6 stimulated the attachment and proliferation of trophoblast cells in vitro. In summary, LIF and IL-6 are important components of embryo-uterine interactions during early pregnancy in the pig, and may contribute to successful conceptus implantation.","['Blitek, A', 'Morawska, E', 'Ziecik, A J']","['Blitek A', 'Morawska E', 'Ziecik AJ']","['Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences, Olsztyn, Poland. a.blitek@pan.olsztyn.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Theriogenology,Theriogenology,0421510,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Estrous Cycle/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/metabolism', 'Swine/*physiology', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-691X(12)00306-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Theriogenology. 2012 Sep 15;78(5):951-64. doi: 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.05.016.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the forward genetics approach provides an alternative, conceptually distinct, strategy for identifying target molecules de novo. This approach, which uses unbiased selection protocols relying directly on the effects of the genes themselves on cell fate, has the potential to identify novel cancer targets which have not been highlighted by conventional approaches. PLAC8, a small cysteine-rich protein with little homology to other proteins, has been identified by both these strategies. Here we confirm that PLAC8 overexpression protects some cancer cell lines from apoptosis, but we also demonstrate for the first time that, in other cell lines, the effect of PLAC8 overexpression is reversed, and, in this context, PLAC8 induces apoptosis. In both cases siRNA-mediated down-regulation of PLAC8 confirms that the activity of endogenously expressed PLAC8 is consistent with that shown by exogenous PLAC8. The striking reversal of the effects of PLAC8 in different cell types is not readily explained by the level of PLAC8 expressed within the cells, by the differential expression of PLAC8 splice variants observed, or by the p53 status of the host cells. This intriguing contrast in the effects of PLAC8 on cell fate in different cellular contexts presents attractive possibilities for the development of novel therapies for cancers, such as pancreatic cancers, where PLAC8 has been shown to be overexpressed.","['Mourtada-Maarabouni, Mirna', 'Watson, David', 'Munir, Mamoona', 'Farzaneh, Farzin', 'Williams, Gwyn T']","['Mourtada-Maarabouni M', 'Watson D', 'Munir M', 'Farzaneh F', 'Williams GT']","['Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine, Keele University, Keele, UK. bia19@biol.keele.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PLAC8 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', '*Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",2012/08/28 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['CCDT-EPUB-20120816-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2013 Jan;13(1):80-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is now flanked by two second-generation molecules, dasatinib and nilotinib - and others are in advanced clinical development. One of the reasons for such intensive research on novel compounds is the problem of resistance, that is thought to be caused, in a proportion of cases, by point mutations in Bcr-Abl. In this article, the authors review how the biological and clinical relevance of Bcr-Abl mutations has evolved in parallel with the availability of more and more therapeutic options.

Early breast cancer, brain tumor, sarcoma, skin cancer, gastrointestinal, lung, gynecological, hematological and other malignancies can be seen in adults. Predictive testing in families with detected LFS and TP53 mutation is offered from the age of 18 for various reasons. One of the most important reasons is a very limited effectivity of prevention especially in children, also the possible risk of psychological harm to the child and his family caused by the diagnosis of this syndrome. Progress in diagnostic methods, especially total body MRI, enables to propose preventive care for early cancer diagnoses for children and adults. Biochemical tests, ultrasound, MRI may improve survival of these high risk individuals and support the possibility of predictive testing in children.","['Foretova, L', 'Sterba, J', 'Opletal, P', 'Mach, V', 'Lisy, J', 'Petrakova, K', 'Palacova, M', 'Navratilova, M', 'Gaillyova, R', 'Puchmajerova, A', 'Krepelova, A', 'Machackova, E']","['Foretova L', 'Sterba J', 'Opletal P', 'Mach V', 'Lisy J', 'Petrakova K', 'Palacova M', 'Navratilova M', 'Gaillyova R', 'Puchmajerova A', 'Krepelova A', 'Machackova E']","['Oddeleni epidemiologie a genetiky nadoru, Masarykuv onkologicky ustav, Brno. foretova@mou.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,,IM,"['Genes, p53/*genetics', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*diagnosis/genetics/prevention & control', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', '*Mutation', '*Whole Body Imaging']",2012/09/07 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['38584 [pii]'],ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2012;25 Suppl:S49-54.,,,,,,,Li-Fraumeni syndrom - navrh komplexni preventivni pece o nosice TP53 mutace s pouzitim celotelove magneticke rezonance.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation Kernel has been recently applied to classification problems with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this paper, we develop a novel and parsimonious positive semidefinite kernel. The proposed kernel is shown experimentally to have better performance when compared to the usual correlation kernel. In addition, we propose a new kernel based on the correlation matrix incorporating techniques dealing with indefinite kernel. The resulting kernel is shown to be positive semidefinite and it exhibits superior performance to the two kernels mentioned above. We then apply the proposed method to some cancer data in discriminating different tumor tissues, providing information for diagnosis of diseases.

These have more restricted lineage potential and eventually differentiate into specific blood cell types. Bone marrow also contains mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which present multilineage differentiation potential toward mesodermal cell types. In bone marrow niches, stem cell interaction with the extracellular matrix is mediated by integrin receptors. Ion channels regulate cell proliferation and differentiation by controlling intracellular Ca(2+), cell volume, release of growth factors, and so forth. Although little evidence is available about the ion channel roles in true HSCs, increasing information is available about HPCs and MSCs, which present a complex pattern of K(+) channel expression. K(+) channels cooperate with Ca(2+) and Cl(-) channels in regulating calcium entry and cell volume during mitosis. Other K(+) channels modulate the integrin-dependent interaction between leukemic progenitor cells and the niche stroma. These channels can also regulate leukemia cell interaction with MSCs, which also involves integrin receptors and affects the MSC-mediated protection from chemotherapy. Ligand-gated channels are also implicated in these processes. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate cell proliferation and migration in HSCs and MSCs and may be implicated in the harmful effects of smoking.","['Pillozzi, Serena', 'Becchetti, Andrea']","['Pillozzi S', 'Becchetti A']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Viale Morgagni 50, 50134 Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120805,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,2012/08/25 06:00,2012/08/25 06:01,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/217910 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Int. 2012;2012:217910. doi: 10.1155/2012/217910.

The n-BuOH fraction of the ethanolic extract of tubers exhibits significant antifertility activity in laboratory animals. The present investigation explored the active principle(s) of the tuber extract with reference to contragestive effects in rats and probed the possible mechanism of action. Bioactivity-guided fractionation identified puerarin as the major constituent that exerted pregnancy-terminating effects. Oral administration of puerarin at >/=300 mg/kg per day for days (D) 1-2 post-coitus resulted in complete implantation failure. Serum oestradiol levels during D2-D5 and progesterone (P(4)) level on D5 remained unaffected, but the endometrial expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and ERbeta was adversely modulated that disrupted the implantation-specific characteristic endometrial oestrogenic milieu. The eventual consequence was loss of endometrial receptivity characterised by down-regulation of the uterine expression of P(4) receptor (PR) and attenuation of endometrial expression of leukaemia inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and cyclo-oxygenase-2, the three important signalling molecules involved in the process of implantation. Light microscopic examination of the embryos demonstrated no untoward effect of puerarin on the development of embryos until D4, but D5 blastocysts underwent gross morphological distortion. The findings taken together are interpreted to suggest that puerarin adversely impacts the uterine expression of ER and PR that disrupts the implantation-conducive uterine milieu and prevents implantation. In conclusion, puerarin may be envisaged as a prospective molecule that merits further exploration for the development of non-steroidal post-coital contraceptive for women.","['Saha, Piyali', 'Saraswat, Ghungroo', 'Chakraborty, Pratip', 'Banerjee, Sayani', 'Pal, Bikas C', 'Kabir, Syed N']","['Saha P', 'Saraswat G', 'Chakraborty P', 'Banerjee S', 'Pal BC', 'Kabir SN']","['Department of Reproductive Biology Research, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Jadavpur, Kolkata 700032, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120823,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Contraceptives, Postcoital)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'Z9W8997416 (puerarin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Contraceptives, Postcoital', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/analysis', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects/physiology', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Isoflavones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/blood', 'Rats', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Uterus/chemistry', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis']",2012/08/25 06:00,2013/04/09 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-11-0423 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-11-0423 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2012 Nov;144(5):633-45. doi: 10.1530/REP-11-0423.

In particular, C-terminal truncation mutations lack a transcription regulatory domain and have increased DNA binding through the runt homology domain. The expression of the runt homology domain, RUNX1(41-214), in mouse hematopoietic cells induced progression to MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. Analysis of premyelodysplastic animals found expansion of c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells and skewed differentiation to myeloid at the expense of the lymphoid lineage. These abnormalities correlate with the phenotype of Runx1-deficient animals, as expected given the reported dominant-negative role of C-terminal mutations over the full-length RUNX1. However, MDS is not observed in Runx1-deficient animals. Gene expression profiling found that RUNX1(41-214) c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells have an overlapping yet distinct gene expression profile from Runx1-deficient animals. Moreover, an unexpected parallel was observed between the hematopoietic phenotype of RUNX1(41-214) and aged animals. Genes deregulated in RUNX1(41-214), but not in Runx1-deficient animals, were inversely correlated with the aging gene signature of HSCs, suggesting that disruption of the expression of genes related to normal aging by RUNX1 mutations contributes to development of MDS.

However, the exact mechanism of APAP-induced JNK activation is incompletely understood. It has been established that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) regulates the late phase of APAP-induced JNK activation, but the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that mediates the initial phase of APAP-induced JNK activation has not been identified. Oxidative stress produced during APAP metabolism causes JNK activation, which promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and results in the amplification of oxidative stress. Therefore, inhibition of the initial phase of JNK activation may be key to protection against APAP-induced liver injury. The goal of this study was to determine whether mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) mediates the initial, ASK1-independent phase of APAP-induced JNK activation and thus promotes drug-induced hepatotoxicity. We found that MLK3 was activated by oxidative stress and was required for JNK activation in response to oxidative stress. Loss of MLK3 attenuated APAP-induced JNK activation and hepatocyte death in vitro, independent of receptor-interacting protein 1. Moreover, JNK and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta activation was significantly attenuated, and Mcl-1 degradation was inhibited in APAP-treated MLK3-knockout mice. Furthermore, we showed that loss of MLK3 increased expression of glutamate cysteine ligase, accelerated hepatic GSH recovery, and decreased production of reactive oxygen species after APAP treatment. MLK3-deficient mice were significantly protected from APAP-induced liver injury, compared with wild-type mice. Together, these studies establish a novel role for MLK3 in APAP-induced JNK activation and hepatotoxicity, and they suggest MLK3 as a possible target in the treatment of APAP-induced liver injury.","['Sharma, Manju', 'Gadang, Vidya', 'Jaeschke, Anja']","['Sharma M', 'Gadang V', 'Jaeschke A']","['Department of Pathology, Metabolic Diseases Institute, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45237, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120823,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ralbp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 11)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*enzymology/etiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2012/08/25 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.079863 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.079863 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2012 Nov;82(5):1001-7. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.079863.

Strikingly, there is a large variability in disease symptoms between individual patients carrying an identical LMNA mutation. This is why classical genetic screens for mutations appear to have limited predictive value for disease development. Recently, the widespread occurrence of repetitive nuclear ruptures has been described in fibroblast cultures from various laminopathy patients. Since this phenomenon was strongly correlated with disease severity, the identification of biomarkers that report on these rupture events could have diagnostic relevance. One such candidate marker is the PML nuclear body, a structure that is normally confined to the nuclear interior, but leaks out of the nucleus upon nuclear rupture. Here, we show that a variety of laminopathies shows the presence of these cytoplasmic PML particles (PML CPs), and that the amount of these protein aggregates increases with severity of the disease. In addition, between clinically healthy individuals, carrying LMNA mutations, significant differences can be found. Therefore, we postulate that detection of PML CPs in patient fibroblasts could become a valuable marker for diagnosis of disease development.","['Houben, F', 'De Vos, W H', 'Krapels, I P C', 'Coorens, M', 'Kierkels, G J J', 'Kamps, M A F', 'Verstraeten, V L R M', 'Marcelis, C L M', 'van den Wijngaard, A', 'Ramaekers, F C S', 'Broers, J L V']","['Houben F', 'De Vos WH', 'Krapels IP', 'Coorens M', 'Kierkels GJ', 'Kamps MA', 'Verstraeten VL', 'Marcelis CL', 'van den Wijngaard A', 'Ramaekers FC', 'Broers JL']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, CARIM, School for Cardiovascular Diseases, Maastricht University Medical Center, UNS50 Box 17, P.O.

RECENT FINDINGS: Long-term follow-up confirmed that unmanipulated HBMT is a promising protocol that can be successfully extended to treat severe aplastic anemia. Recent observations regarding immune recovery, infections, and strategy for modified donor lymphocyte infusions have provided insight into the prevention of infections and the decrease in relapse after HBMT. Extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) strongly and negatively impacts patient health-related quality of life, suggesting that it should be successfully controlled. A prospective study suggested the inclusion of HBMT in treatment algorithms as a viable option for adults with acute myeloid leukemia with unfavorable cytogenetics who lack a matched donor. Randomized clinical trials are warranted to investigate whether mixture grafts of G-CSF-mobilized blood and marrow or G-PB alone should be chosen as allografts in haploidentical settings. SUMMARY: Unmanipulated HBMT is a reliable protocol. New strategies should be investigated to decrease the incidences of GVHD and relapse. Novel mobilization regimens such as AMD3100 alone or G-CSF+AMD3100 for allograft engineering may improve transplant outcomes following HBMT.","['Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Chang YJ', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Haploidy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*psychology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/08/25 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283582322 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Nov;19(6):454-61. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283582322.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collectively, the EuroClonality (BIOMED-2) guidelines and consensus reporting system should help to improve the general performance level of clonality assessment and interpretation, which will directly impact on routine clinical management (standardized best-practice) in patients with suspected lymphoproliferations.","['Langerak, A W', 'Groenen, P J T A', 'Bruggemann, M', 'Beldjord, K', 'Bellan, C', 'Bonello, L', 'Boone, E', 'Carter, G I', 'Catherwood, M', 'Davi, F', 'Delfau-Larue, M-H', 'Diss, T', 'Evans, P A S', 'Gameiro, P', 'Garcia Sanz, R', 'Gonzalez, D', 'Grand, D', 'Hakansson, A', 'Hummel, M', 'Liu, H', 'Lombardia, L', 'Macintyre, E A', 'Milner, B J', 'Montes-Moreno, S', 'Schuuring, E', 'Spaargaren, M', 'Hodges, E', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['Langerak AW', 'Groenen PJ', 'Bruggemann M', 'Beldjord K', 'Bellan C', 'Bonello L', 'Boone E', 'Carter GI', 'Catherwood M', 'Davi F', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Diss T', 'Evans PA', 'Gameiro P', 'Garcia Sanz R', 'Gonzalez D', 'Grand D', 'Hakansson A', 'Hummel M', 'Liu H', 'Lombardia L', 'Macintyre EA', 'Milner BJ', 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Schuuring E', 'Spaargaren M', 'Hodges E', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. a.langerak@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120824,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",2012/08/25 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012246 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.246 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Oct;26(10):2159-71. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.246.

Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of miRNA expression is associated with increased tumorigenicity and a poor prognosis in several types of cancers. The miRNA let-7b is one of the severely downregulated miRNAs in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. In vitro transfection of leukemogenic MLL fusion genes into human embryonic kidney-293 cells suppressed let-7b expression. In leukemic cells with an MLL fusion gene, the regulatory region for let-7b expression was hypermethylated, and its expression was partially recovered after culturing the cells with the demethylating agent 5-azacitidine. These results suggest that loss of let-7b expression may be one of the consequences of oncogenic MLL fusion proteins, and contributes to leukemogenesis possibly through the upregulation of let-7b-regulated target genes with leukemogenic potential in hematopoietic cells. The enforced expression of let-7b in ALL cell lines with an MLL fusion gene inhibited their growth, indicating the possible use of let-7b as a new therapeutic tool for refractory infant ALL with an MLL fusion gene.","['Nishi, M', 'Eguchi-Ishimae, M', 'Wu, Z', 'Gao, W', 'Iwabuki, H', 'Kawakami, S', 'Tauchi, H', 'Inukai, T', 'Sugita, K', 'Hamasaki, Y', 'Ishii, E', 'Eguchi, M']","['Nishi M', 'Eguchi-Ishimae M', 'Wu Z', 'Gao W', 'Iwabuki H', 'Kawakami S', 'Tauchi H', 'Inukai T', 'Sugita K', 'Hamasaki Y', 'Ishii E', 'Eguchi M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120824,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/08/25 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012242 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.242 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Feb;27(2):389-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.242.

Although HU has been associated with an increased risk of leukemia in some patients with myeloproliferative disorders, the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of HU has not been established. This study used the alkaline comet assay to investigate DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes from 41 individuals with SCA treated with HU (SCAHU) and from 26 normal individuals. The presence of HbS and the analysis of the haplotypes of the beta S gene cluster were done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The damage index (DI) in the SCAHU group was significantly higher than in controls (p<0.001). Neither gender nor age was associated with DNA damage in controls or SCAHU individuals. Among the SCAHU individuals, DI was significantly influenced by length of HU treatment (p=0.0039) and BMI (p=0.001). Individuals with length of HU treatment>/=20 months and BMI</=20kg/m(2) had a significantly greater DI than those with length of HU treatment<20 months and BMI>20kg/m(2). No significant influence of mean HU dose was observed on DI (p=0.950). However, individuals who received a mean HU dose>/=20mg/kg showed a higher DI than those who received less. Furthermore, an association was observed between DI damage and HBB*S gene haplotypes. DI values for the Bantu/Bantu haplotype was greater when compared to the Benin/Benin haplotype; and the Bantu/Benin haplotype had a DI lower than the Bantu/Bantu haplotype and greater than the Benin/Benin haplotype.

Recent study showed that cold winter temperature naturally selected p53 Arg72 in eastern Asian population, suggesting that p53 plays a role in reproduction. It has also been reported that some SNPs of p53, Mdm2(Murine double minute 2), MdmX and Hausp (Herpes virus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease) in p53 pathway are associated with the risk of the women's reproduction disorder. p53 regulates the LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor) expression level by its DBD domain, and thus contributes to female reproduction by affecting the embryo implantation process. The MDM2, MDMX, and HAUSP proteins regulates the level and activity of p53 protein, which are critical for the appropriate p53 response in the embryo implantation process. The members of p53 family, p63 and p73, also play roles in female reproduction through other pathways. p63 has been implicated as a major regulator of oocyte death following treatment with irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which prevents fetal malformation. p73 regulates the formation of spindle assembly complex(SAC). The dysfunction of SAC results in poor blastocyst quality and defects in kinetochore-microtubule associations, which leads to aneuploidy. This review summarized the function of p53 family and its pathway related proteins in female reproduction, pointed out a new method in improving the success rate in IVF-ET, and provided a new diagnosis idea for unexplained infertile women.

Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes represent a novel class of point mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. These mutations prevent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate and confer novel enzymatic activity, facilitating the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to d-2-hydroxyglutarate, a putative oncometabolite. IDH1/IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, and their combined frequency is approximately 17% in unselected acute myeloid leukemia cases, 27% in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia cases, and up to 67% in acute myeloid leukemia cases with cuplike nuclei. These mutations are largely mutually exclusive. Despite many similarities of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, it is possible that they represent distinct molecular or clinical subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia. All known mutations involve arginine (R), in codon 132 of IDH1 or codon 140 or 172 of IDH2. IDH1(R132) and IDH2(R140) mutations are frequently accompanied by normal cytogenetics and NPM1 mutation, whereas IDH2(R172) is frequently the only mutation detected in acute myeloid leukemia. There is increasing evidence that the prognostic impact of IDH1/2 mutations varies according to the specific mutation and also depends on the context of concurrent mutations of other genes. IDH1(R132) mutation may predict poor outcome in a subset of patients with molecular low-risk acute myeloid leukemia, whereas IDH2(R172) mutations confer a poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

However, patient resistance and cytotoxicity make secondary lines of treatment, such as omacetaxine mepesuccinate, a necessity. Given that drug cytotoxicity represents a major problem during treatment, it is essential to understand the biological pathways affected to better predict poor drug response and prioritize a treatment regime. METHODS: We conducted cell viability and gene expression assays to determine heritability and gene expression changes associated with imatinib and omacetaxine treatment of 55 non-cancerous lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived from 17 pedigrees. In total, 48,803 transcripts derived from Illumina Human WG-6 BeadChips were analyzed for each sample using SOLAR, whilst correcting for kinship structure. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity within cell lines was highly heritable following imatinib treatment (h2 = 0.60-0.73), but not omacetaxine treatment. Cell lines treated with an IC20 dose of imatinib or omacetaxine showed differential gene expression for 956 (1.96%) and 3,892 transcripts (7.97%), respectively; 395 of these (0.8%) were significantly influenced by both imatinib and omacetaxine treatment. k-means clustering and DAVID functional annotation showed expression changes in genes related to kinase binding and vacuole-related functions following imatinib treatment, whilst expression changes in genes related to cell division and apoptosis were evident following treatment with omacetaxine. The enrichment scores for these ontologies were very high (mostly >10). CONCLUSIONS: Induction of gene expression changes related to different pathways following imatinib and omacetaxine treatment suggests that the cytotoxicity of such drugs may be differentially tolerated by individuals based on their genetic background.","['Kulkarni, Hemant', 'Goring, Harald H H', 'Diego, Vincent', 'Cole, Shelley', 'Walder, Ken R', 'Collier, Greg R', 'Blangero, John', 'Carless, Melanie A']","['Kulkarni H', 'Goring HH', 'Diego V', 'Cole S', 'Walder KR', 'Collier GR', 'Blangero J', 'Carless MA']","['Department of Genetics, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227, USA. hkulkarn@txbiomedgenetics.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120823,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Harringtonines/*toxicity', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inheritance Patterns/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperazines/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2012/08/25 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-5-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-5-37 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2012 Aug 23;5:37. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-5-37.,PMC3483163,"['P01 HL045522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 MH059490/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029392/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR017515/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although extensively documented in various types of human cancers and viral infections, controversy exists in the exact mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) retroviral infections. RESULTS: IFN-alpha displayed strong anti-HIV-1 effects in HIV-1/HTLV-1 co-infected MT-4 cells in vitro, demonstrated by the dose-dependent inhibition of the HIV-1-induced cytopathic effect (IC50 = 83.5 IU/ml, p < 0.0001) and p24 levels in cell-free supernatant (IC50 = 1.2 IU/ml, p < 0.0001). In contrast, IFN-alpha treatment did not affect cell viability or HTLV-1 viral mRNA levels in HTLV-1 mono-infected cell lines, based on flow cytometry and nCounter analysis, respectively. However, we were able to confirm the previously described post-transcriptional inhibition of HTLV-1 p19 secretion by IFN-alpha in cell lines (p = 0.0045), and extend this finding to primary Adult T cell Leukemia patient samples (p = 0.031). In addition, through microarray and nCounter analysis, we performed the first genome-wide simultaneous quantification of complete human and retroviral transciptomes, demonstrating significant transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes without concomitant decrease of HTLV-1 mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that both the absence of in vitro antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity as well as the modest post-transcriptional antiviral activity of IFN-alpha against HTLV-1, were not due to a cell-intrinsic defect in IFN-alpha signalisation, but rather represents a retrovirus-specific phenomenon, considering the strong HIV-1 inhibition in co-infected cells.","['Moens, Britta', 'Pannecouque, Christophe', 'Lopez, Giovanni', 'Talledo, Michael', 'Gotuzzo, Eduardo', 'Khouri, Ricardo', 'Bittencourt, Achilea', 'Farre, Lourdes', 'Galvao-Castro, Bernardo', 'Vandamme, Anne-Mieke', 'Van Weyenbergh, Johan']","['Moens B', 'Pannecouque C', 'Lopez G', 'Talledo M', 'Gotuzzo E', 'Khouri R', 'Bittencourt A', 'Farre L', 'Galvao-Castro B', 'Vandamme AM', 'Van Weyenbergh J']","['Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120823,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Signal Transduction']",2012/08/25 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-9-171 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-9-171 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2012 Aug 23;9:171. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-9-171.,PMC3492208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromatograms of on-line post column derivatisation assay coupled with HPLC revealed the existence of active phenolics (hump) in the coloured genotypes, which was lacking in the white-coloured breeding line, TF(Ic*As)*483/13. Roasting reduced the phenolic content, and diminished antioxidant activity by 10-40 % as measured by the reagent-based assays (diphenylpicrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) in all genotypes. Cell culture-based antioxidant activity assay (cellular antioxidant activity) showed an increase of activity in the coloured genotypes after roasting. Faba bean extracts demonstrated cellular protection ability against H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage (assessed using RAW264.7 cells), and inhibited the proliferation of all human cancer cell lines (BL13, AGS, Hep G2 and HT-29) evaluated. However, the effect of faba bean extracts on the non-transformed human cells (CCD-18Co) was negligible. Flow cytometric analyses showed that faba bean extracts successfully induced apoptosis of HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia) cells. The faba bean extracts also exhibited ACE, alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activities. Overall, extracts from Nura (buff-coloured) and Rossa (red-coloured) were comparable, while TF(Ic*As)*483/13 (white-coloured) contained the lowest phenolic content and exhibited the least antioxidant and enzyme inhibition activities. These results are important to promote the utilisation of faba beans in human diets for various health benefits.","['Siah, Siem D', 'Konczak, Izabela', 'Agboola, Samson', 'Wood, Jennifer A', 'Blanchard, Christopher L']","['Siah SD', 'Konczak I', 'Agboola S', 'Wood JA', 'Blanchard CL']","['Food Futures Flagship, CSIRO Food and Nutritional Sciences, 11 Julius Avenue, North Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Nutr,The British journal of nutrition,0372547,"['0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)']",IM,"['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/analysis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Australia', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Chemoprevention', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Diet', '*Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/analysis', 'Genotype', 'Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors', '*Health Promotion', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Lipase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Phenols/analysis', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', '*Seeds/chemistry/genetics', '*Vicia faba/chemistry/genetics']",2012/08/25 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007114512000803 [pii]', '10.1017/S0007114512000803 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 1:S123-34. doi: 10.1017/S0007114512000803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice derived from this source were selectively bred for sensitivity to histamine diphosphate and the B strain of Friend leukemia virus. This led to the establishment of the FVB/N inbred strain, which was subsequently imported to the Jackson Laboratory and designated FVB/NJ. The FVB/NJ mouse has several distinct characteristics, such as large pronuclear morphology, vigorous reproductive performance, and consistently large litters that make it highly desirable for transgenic strain production and general purpose use. RESULTS: Using next-generation sequencing technology, we have sequenced the genome of FVB/NJ to approximately 50-fold coverage, and have generated a comprehensive catalog of single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertion/deletion polymorphisms, and structural variants, relative to the reference C57BL/6J genome. We have examined a previously identified quantitative trait locus for atherosclerosis susceptibility on chromosome 10 and identify several previously unknown candidate causal variants. CONCLUSION: The sequencing of the FVB/NJ genome and generation of this catalog has increased the number of known variant sites in FVB/NJ by a factor of four, and will help accelerate the identification of the precise molecular variants that are responsible for phenotypes observed in this widely used strain.","['Wong, Kim', 'Bumpstead, Suzannah', 'Van Der Weyden, Louise', 'Reinholdt, Laura G', 'Wilming, Laurens G', 'Adams, David J', 'Keane, Thomas M']","['Wong K', 'Bumpstead S', 'Van Der Weyden L', 'Reinholdt LG', 'Wilming LG', 'Adams DJ', 'Keane TM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120823,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Genome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2012/08/25 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2012/08/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['gb-2012-13-8-r72 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2012-13-8-r72 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2012 Aug 23;13(8):R72. doi: 10.1186/gb-2012-13-8-r72.,PMC3491372,"['G0800024/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P40 OD010972/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We performed transcriptional profiling on these stromal fibroblasts to investigate if they were affected by the presence of drug-treated ALL cells. These mitotically inactivated MEFs showed few changes in gene expression, but a family of sequences of which transcription is significantly increased was identified. A sequence related to this family, which we named cassini, was selected for further characterization. We found that cassini was highly upregulated in drug-treated ALL cells. Analysis of RNAs from different normal mouse tissues showed that cassini expression is highest in spleen and thymus, and can be further enhanced in these organs by exposure of mice to bacterial endotoxin. Heat shock, but not other types of stress, significantly induced the transcription of this locus in ALL cells. Transient overexpression of cassini in human 293 embryonic kidney cells did not increase the cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs but provided some protection. Database searches revealed that sequences highly homologous to cassini are present in rodents, apicomplexans, flatworms and primates, indicating that they are conserved in evolution. Moreover, CASSINI RNA was induced in human ALL cells treated with vincristine. Surprisingly, cassini belongs to the previously reported murine family of gamma-satellite/major satellite DNA sequences, which were not known to be present in other species. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the transcription of at least one member of these sequences is regulated, suggesting that this has a function in normal and transformed immune cells.

JAK2-selective inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Data from drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients demonstrate that treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor generates resistance via mutation or amplification of BCR-ABL. We hypothesize that treatment with small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 will similarly generate inhibitor-resistant mutants in JAK2. METHODOLOGY: In order to identify inhibitor-resistant JAK2 mutations a priori, we utilized TEL-JAK2 to conduct an in vitro random mutagenesis screen for JAK2 alleles resistant to JAK Inhibitor-I. Isolated mutations were evaluated for their ability to sustain cellular growth, stimulate downstream signaling pathways, and phosphorylate a novel JAK2 substrate in the presence of inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations were found exclusively in the kinase domain of JAK2. The panel of mutations conferred resistance to high concentrations of inhibitor accompanied by sustained activation of the Stat5, Erk1/2, and Akt pathways. Using a JAK2 substrate, enhanced catalytic activity of the mutant JAK2 kinase was observed in inhibitor concentrations 200-fold higher than is inhibitory to the wild-type protein. When testing the panel of mutations in the context of the Jak2 V617F allele, we observed that a subset of mutations conferred resistance to inhibitor, validating the use of TEL-JAK2 in the initial screen. These results demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors select for JAK2 inhibitor-resistant alleles, and the design of next-generation JAK2 inhibitors should consider the location of mutations arising in inhibitor-resistant screens.","['Marit, Michael R', 'Chohan, Manprit', 'Matthew, Natasha', 'Huang, Kai', 'Kuntz, Douglas A', 'Rose, David R', 'Barber, Dwayne L']","['Marit MR', 'Chohan M', 'Matthew N', 'Huang K', 'Kuntz DA', 'Rose DR', 'Barber DL']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*chemistry/*drug effects/genetics', 'Mutagenesis/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043437 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-23173 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43437. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043437.

Tumor viruses often target DNA repair machinery to achieve transformation. The Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the only known transforming human retrovirus and the etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATLL). Although HTLV-I-transformed leukemic cells have numerous genetic lesions, the precise role of the viral tax gene in this process is not fully understood. RESULTS: Our results show a novel function of HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax as an inducer of genomic DNA double strand breaks (DDSB) during DNA replication. We also found that Tax acts as a potent inhibitor of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair through the activation of the NF-kB pathway. These results were confirmed using HTLV-I molecular clones expressing Tax at physiological levels in a natural context. We further found that HTLV-I- and Tax-transformed cells are not more susceptible to DNA damaging agents and repair DNA lesions at a rate similar to that of normal cells. Finally, we demonstrated that during S phase, Tax-associated DDSB are preferentially repaired using the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights in Tax effects on DNA repair and genome instability. Although it may not be self sufficient, the creation of DNA breaks and subsequent abnormal use of the non-conservative NHEJ DNA repair during the S phase in HTLV-I-infected Tax-expressing cells may cooperate with other factors to increase genetic and genome instability and favor transformation.","['Baydoun, Hicham H', 'Bai, Xue Tao', 'Shelton, Shary', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Baydoun HH', 'Bai XT', 'Shelton S', 'Nicot C']","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120820,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA End-Joining Repair', '*DNA Replication', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0042226 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-09147 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e42226. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0042226.

Here we show that deletion of mir-181a-1/b-1 expression inhibits the development of Notch1 oncogene-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). mir-181a-1/b-1 controls the strength and threshold of Notch activity in tumorigenesis in part by dampening multiple negative feedback regulators downstream of NOTCH and pre-T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways. Importantly, although Notch oncogenes utilize normal thymic progenitor cell genetic programs for tumor transformation, comparative analyses of mir-181a-1/b-1 function in normal thymocyte and tumor development demonstrate that mir-181a-1/b-1 can be specifically targeted to inhibit tumor development with little toxicity to normal development.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib was the first targeted therapy licensed for patients with chronic-phase CML, and its introduction was associated with substantial improvements in response and survival compared with previous therapies. Clinical trial data are now available for the second-generation TKIs (nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib) in the first-, second-, and third-line settings. A qualitative systematic review was conducted to qualitatively compare the clinical effectiveness, safety, and effect on quality of life of TKIs for the management of chronic-, accelerated-, or blast-phase CML patients. METHODS: Included studies were identified through a search of electronic databases in September 2011, relevant conference proceedings and the grey literature. RESULTS: In the first-line setting, the long-term efficacy (up to 8 years) of imatinib has been confirmed in a single randomized controlled trial (International Randomized Study of Interferon [IRIS]). All second-generation TKIs reported lower rates of transformation, and comparable or superior complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and complete molecular response rates compared with imatinib by 2-year follow-up. Each of the second-generation TKIs was associated with a distinct adverse-event profile. Bosutinib was the only second-generation TKI to report quality-of-life data (no significant difference compared with imatinib treatment). Data in the second- and third-line setting confirmed the efficacy of the second-generation TKIs in either imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, as measured by CCyR and MMR rates. CONCLUSION: Data from first-line randomized controlled trials reporting up to 2-year follow-up indicate superior response rates of the second-generation TKIs compared with imatinib. Current evidence from single-arm studies in the second-line setting confirm that nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are valuable treatment options for the significant subgroup of patients who are intolerant or resistant to imatinib treatment.","['Ferdinand, Roxanne', 'Mitchell, Stephen A', 'Batson, Sarah', 'Tumur, Indra']","['Ferdinand R', 'Mitchell SA', 'Batson S', 'Tumur I']","['Pfizer, Tadworth, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120803,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,2012/08/24 06:00,2012/08/24 06:01,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S33380 [doi]', 'jbm-3-051 [pii]']",ppublish,J Blood Med. 2012;3:51-76. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S33380.

FeLV antigen-positive cats were significantly younger (median 3.7 v 11.3 years), and had significantly shorter response duration (median 25 days v 472 days) with therapy. In the cats of the second period, gastrointestinal and extranodal lymphomas were the most common anatomical sites, and the majority of those cats were FeLV antigen-negative. Thus, other aetiologies than progressive FeLV infection must have a greater impact on cancerogenesis among affected cats with lymphoma to date.","['Meichner, K', 'Kruse, D B', 'Hirschberger, J', 'Hartmann, K']","['Meichner K', 'Kruse DB', 'Hirschberger J', 'Hartmann K']","['Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, Centre of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Veterinaerstrasse 13, 80539 Munich, Germany.

CRLF2 binds its ligand thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a heterodimer with IL7R. Subsets of CRLF2-overexpressing B-ALLs also have a gain-of-function CRLF2 F232C mutation or activating mutations in JAK2. Whether these mutant alleles confer differences in signaling has not been addressed. Through a domain mutation analysis, we demonstrate a distinct dependence on the CRLF2 intracellular tyrosine Y368 in signaling by CRLF2 F232C, but not signaling induced by TSLP or through CRLF2/mutant JAK2. In contrast, CRLF2 signaling in each context is strictly dependent on both the CRLF2 box1 domain and the intracellular tryptophan W286. Using a global quantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by TSLP, we previously identified TSLP-induced phosphorylation of multiple kinases implicated in B-cell receptor signaling, including Lyn, Btk, Hck, Syk, MAPK8, MAPK9, and MAPK10. We now demonstrate that cells dependent on CRLF2/mutant JAK2 have reduced phosphorylation at these targets, suggesting that the kinases promote TSLP-mediated proliferation but serve as negative regulators of CRLF2/mutant JAK2 signaling. Thus, targetable nodes downstream of CRLF2 differ based on the presence or absence of additional mutations in CRLF2 signaling components.","['van Bodegom, Diederik', 'Zhong, Jun', 'Kopp, Nadja', 'Dutta, Chaitali', 'Kim, Min-Sik', 'Bird, Liat', 'Weigert, Oliver', 'Tyner, Jeffrey', 'Pandey, Akhilesh', 'Yoda, Akinori', 'Weinstock, David M']","['van Bodegom D', 'Zhong J', 'Kopp N', 'Dutta C', 'Kim MS', 'Bird L', 'Weigert O', 'Tyner J', 'Pandey A', 'Yoda A', 'Weinstock DM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120820,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'GT0IL38SP4 (thymic stromal lymphopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/metabolism']",2012/08/24 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46341-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-413252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 4;120(14):2853-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-413252.

Molecular mutations have been analyzed to subdivide AML with normal karyotype into prognostic subsets. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for the entire AML cohort solely based on molecular markers. One thousand patients with cytogenetic data were investigated for the following molecular alterations: PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, FLT3-ITD, and MLL-PTD, as well as mutations in NPM1, CEPBA, RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53. Clinical data were available in 841 patients. Based on Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, 5 distinct prognostic subgroups were identified: (1) very favorable: PML-RARA rearrangement (n = 29) or CEPBA double mutations (n = 42; overall survival [OS] at 3 years: 82.9%); (2) favorable: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n = 35), CBFB-MYH11 (n = 31), or NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD (n = 186; OS at 3 years: 62.6%); (3) intermediate: none of the mutations leading to assignment into groups 1, 2, 4, or 5 (n = 235; OS at 3 years: 44.2%); (4) unfavorable: MLL-PTD and/or RUNX1 mutation and/or ASXL1 mutation (n = 203; OS at 3 years: 21.9%); and (5) very unfavorable: TP53 mutation (n = 80; OS at 3 years: 0%; P < .001).

Intracellular CRT translocation to the cell surface induces immunogenic cell death, suggesting a role in tumor suppression. In this study, we investigated CRT regulation in the serum of patients with AML. We found that CRT is not only exposed by exocytosis on the outer cell membrane after treatment with anthracyclin but also ultimately released to the serum in vitro and in AML patients during induction therapy. Leukemic cells of 113 AML patients showed increased levels of cell-surface CRT (P < .0001) and N-terminus serum CRT (P < .0001) compared with normal myeloid cells. Neutrophil elastase was identified to cleave an N-terminus CRT peptide, which was characterized as vasostatin and blocked ATRA-triggered differentiation. Levels of serum vasostatin in patients with AML inversely correlated with bone marrow vascularization, suggesting a role in antiangiogenesis. Finally, patients with increased vasostatin levels had longer relapse-free survival (P = .04) and specifically benefited from autologous transplantation (P = .006). Our data indicate that vasostatin is released from cell-surface CRT and impairs differentiation of myeloid cells and vascularization of the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Mans, Sarah', 'Banz, Yara', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Mans S', 'Banz Y', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (vasostatin)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calreticulin/genetics/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*prevention & control', 'Peptide Fragments/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46373-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-412759 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Sep 27;120(13):2690-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-412759.

Similarly, in other malignancies leukemia cells accumulate mutations during growth, forming heterogeneous cell populations that are subject to Darwinian selection and may respond differentially to treatment. There is therefore a clinical need to monitor changes in the subclonal composition of cancers during disease progression. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing to track subclonal heterogeneity in 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients subjected to repeated cycles of therapy. We reveal different somatic mutation profiles in each patient and use these to establish probable hierarchical patterns of subclonal evolution, to identify subclones that decline or expand over time, and to detect founder mutations. We show that clonal evolution patterns are heterogeneous in individual patients. We conclude that genome sequencing is a powerful and sensitive approach to monitor disease progression repeatedly at the molecular level. If applied to future clinical trials, this approach might eventually influence treatment strategies as a tool to individualize and direct cancer treatment.","['Schuh, Anna', 'Becq, Jennifer', 'Humphray, Sean', 'Alexa, Adrian', 'Burns, Adam', 'Clifford, Ruth', 'Feller, Stephan M', 'Grocock, Russell', 'Henderson, Shirley', 'Khrebtukova, Irina', 'Kingsbury, Zoya', 'Luo, Shujun', 'McBride, David', 'Murray, Lisa', 'Menju, Toshi', 'Timbs, Adele', 'Ross, Mark', 'Taylor, Jenny', 'Bentley, David']","['Schuh A', 'Becq J', 'Humphray S', 'Alexa A', 'Burns A', 'Clifford R', 'Feller SM', 'Grocock R', 'Henderson S', 'Khrebtukova I', 'Kingsbury Z', 'Luo S', 'McBride D', 'Murray L', 'Menju T', 'Timbs A', 'Ross M', 'Taylor J', 'Bentley D']","['Oxford National Institute of Health Research NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom. anna.schuh@ndcls.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Clonal Deletion', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Selection, Genetic', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53844-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-433540 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 15;120(20):4191-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-433540.

We tested this hypothesis in a register-based study of hospitalisations for infectious diseases prior to diagnosis of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: A nation-wide cohort encompassing all Danish children aged 0-14 years and born between 1977 and 2008 (N = 1,778,129) was established and followed for hospitalisations for infectious diseases and risk of childhood ALL. The exposure was lagged 1 year to limit reverse causality. In the statistical analyses exposure was defined as (time dependent) number of early or late (before 2 or at/after 2 years of age) hospitalisations to further explore possible age-dependent associations. RESULTS: A total of 815 children were diagnosed with ALL during follow-up. Risk of ALL was associated neither with hospitalisations for infectious diseases before (incidence rate ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.07) nor at/after 2 years of age (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.81-1.32). This also applied to subsets of ALL supposedly initiated prenatally. CONCLUSION: The absence of association between hospitalisation for infections and risk of childhood ALL directs future investigations of the role of infections in development of childhood ALL towards exploration of less severe infections.","['Vestergaard, Therese Risom', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Grau, Katrine', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik']","['Vestergaard TR', 'Rostgaard K', 'Grau K', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Hjalgrim H']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. theresevestergaard@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24286 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Mar;60(3):428-32. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24286.

In this retrospective study, we identified patients who underwent HSCT between January 1992 and December 2010 and had IMDD post transplant. A total of 1,484 patients received HSCT and 7 (0.5 %) suffered from IMDD; five were men, and the median age was 54 years (range, 29-64 years). HSCT treated acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (n = 1). All received an HLA matched donor graft, related (6), unrelated (1); from the bone marrow (1), peripheral blood stem cell (6); and T-cell depleted, ex vivo (6) or in vivo (1). The median time from transplant to neurologic symptoms was 120 days (range, 60-390 days). Three had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), three acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (AIDP) and one autonomic neuropathy. Four of six patients tested had hemopoietic mixed chimerism prior to neurologic symptoms and low CD4(+) T-cell counts, median 76 (15-500 cells/muL). Two patients had simultaneous systemic graft versus host disease (GVHD). Two patients with ADEM had a spinal cord or brain biopsy which revealed demyelination. No patients had a viral etiology identified in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were treated with IV immunoglobulin, high dose steroids and/or rituximab. Five patients had a significant recovery. Response to immune modulators suggests an immune-based etiology. The incidence of de novo autoimmune disease after HSCT for hematological diseases is rare and may be difficult to differentiate from GVHD.","['Delios, Anna Maria', 'Rosenblum, Marc', 'Jakubowski, Ann A', 'DeAngelis, Lisa M']","['Delios AM', 'Rosenblum M', 'Jakubowski AA', 'DeAngelis LM']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120823,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,,IM,"['Adult', 'Central Nervous System/*immunology/pathology', 'Demyelinating Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/immunology/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nervous System/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-012-0962-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2012 Nov;110(2):251-6. doi: 10.1007/s11060-012-0962-9.

A sample of newly diagnosed (n = 158) AML patients from the Japanese Childhood AML Cooperative Treatment Protocol, AML 99, were simultaneously analyzed for WT1 expression, cytogenetic abnormalities and gene alterations (FLT3, KIT, MLL, and RAS). WT1 expression (including more than 2,500 copies/mugRNA) was detected in 122 of the 158 (77.8 %) initial diagnostic AML bone marrow samples (median 45,500 copies/mugRNA). Higher WT1 expression was detected in French American British (FAB)-M0, M3, M7 and lower expression in M4 and M5. Higher WT1 expression was detected in AML with inv(16), t(15;17) and Down syndrome and lower in AML with 11q23 abnormalities. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), KIT mutation, MLL-partial tandem duplication were correlated with poor prognosis; however, higher WT1 expression was not. FLT3-ITD was correlated with WT1 expression and prognosis. Furthermore, 74 WT1 expression after induction chemotherapy was analyzed. Higher WT1 expression after induction chemotherapy was significantly correlated with M1 or M2/M3 marrow, FLT3-ITD and poor prognosis. Multivariate analyses in 74 AML patients revealed that FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD, and KIT mutations were associated with poor prognosis; however, NRAS Mutation, KRAS mutation and high WT1 expression (>10,000 copies/mugRNA) did not show poor prognosis. Our findings suggest that higher WT1 expression at diagnosis does not correlate with poor prognosis, but that WT1 expression after induction chemotherapy is considered to be a useful predictor of clinical outcome in pediatric AML.","['Shimada, Akira', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Koga, Daisuke', 'Tabuchi, Ken', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Tsukimoto, Ichiro', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Shimada A', 'Taki T', 'Koga D', 'Tabuchi K', 'Tawa A', 'Hanada R', 'Tsuchida M', 'Horibe K', 'Tsukimoto I', 'Adachi S', 'Kojima S', 'Hayashi Y']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, 779 Shimohakoda, Hokkitsu, Shibukawa, Gunma 377-8577, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120823,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1163-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Oct;96(4):469-76. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1163-1.

BLV has many effects on the health status and productivity of infected animals and is a potential risk for humans. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of and genotype bovine leukemia viruses on Jordanian dairy farms. Nested PCR coupled with RFLP and direct sequencing of a partial fragment of the env gene were carried out. Two BLV genotypes were found, genotypes 1 and 6. These genotypes were identified by nested PCR-RFLP of 444 bp of the env gene by restriction digestion with HaeIII, Bcl I and Pvu II. However, BLV-Jordan-10 seems to represent an entirely new genotype in our phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequence identity between these two Jordanian BLV genotypes (1 and 6) was 96.2 %. The nucleotide sequence identity between Jordanian BLV genotype 1 and other reference BLV genotype 1 strains ranged from 99 % to 99.5 %.

Moreover, it has recently emerged that several types of leukemia develop and relapse through complex interactions with bone marrow (BM) components and may directly affect the HSC and their niche. Increasing attention has therefore been dedicated to the BM microenvironment the HSC reside in, with the view that a better understanding of the molecular regulators of HSC-niche interaction in vivo will allow improving HSC mobilization, collection and transplantation and provide clues for the development of innovative leukemia treatments. This chapter focuses on a recently established technique for the visualization of transplanted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) within the calvarium bone marrow of live mice (Lo Celso et al. Nature 457:92-96, 2007). Intravital microscopy is a rapidly developing field, driven by constant improvement in both detection technologies (i.e., spatial resolution, depth of penetration, spectral definition) and probe availability (i.e., increasingly sophisticated genetic and chemical reporter systems). We therefore discuss the current limitations and challenges related to intravital microscopy of the HSC niche and introduce a number of potential imaging approaches, which could be promising candidates for future development of this technique.","['Barrett, Oliver', 'Sottocornola, Roberta', 'Lo Celso, Cristina']","['Barrett O', 'Sottocornola R', 'Lo Celso C']","['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Imperial College, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Imaging/*methods', 'Skull', 'Staining and Labeling', '*Stem Cell Niche']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-980-8_18 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2012;916:231-42. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-980-8_18.,,['11831/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phytochemical screening of active extracts was also planned. METHODS: Petroleum ether, ethanolic, and aqueous extracts of S indicus Linn, G lucidum P Karst, and U dioica Linn were subjected to cytotoxicity studies using 7 different cancer cell lines. Potent cytotoxicity was noted in petroleum ether extract of S indicus (SIP), which inhibited proliferation of various cancer cell lines. Growth inhibition was determined by sulforhodamine B assay. Two biochemical markers, namely beta-sitosterol and 7-hydroxyfrullanolide were isolated and characterized using high-performance thin layer chromatography, melting point, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass analysis. Cytotoxicity of isolated beta-sitosterol and 7-hydroxyfrullanolide were also determined. The IC(50) of SIP was calculated in the HL-60 cells and was found to be 53 microg/mL. Furthermore, SIP induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells as measured by several biological end points. Cell cycle analysis and change in mitochondrial membrane potential was quantified by flow cytometry. Subsequently, using annexin V/PI assay, proportion of cells actively undergoing apoptosis was determined. Changes in DNA were observed by DNA ladder assay. RESULTS: SIP induced apoptotic bodies formation, induced DNA laddering, enhanced annexin-V-FITC binding of the cells, increased sub-G(0) DNA fraction, and induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in HL-60 cells. SIP also elevated the caspase 3 and caspase 9 levels in the HL-60 cells, which clearly indicates the involvement of the intrinsic proteins in inducing apoptosis. DISCUSSION: All the above parameters revealed that SIP induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial-dependent pathway in HL-60 cells. The criterion for anticancer activity in cytotoxicity assay was >/=70% growth inhibition at 100 microg/mL against at least 4 cell lines. As G lucidum and U dioica did not exhibit appreciable inhibitory activity against human cancer cell lines (less than 50%), they were not included in the study thereafter. The results established that SIP has apoptosis-inducing effect against HL-60 cells in vitro and is a promising candidate for further anticancer study. beta-Sitosterol and 7-hydroxyfrullanolide can be considered to be potent anticancer compounds isolated from SIP on the basis of present studies.","['Nahata, Alok', 'Saxena, Arpita', 'Suri, Nitasha', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar', 'Dixit, Vinod Kumar']","['Nahata A', 'Saxena A', 'Suri N', 'Saxena AK', 'Dixit VK']","['Doctor Hari Singh Gour Vishwavidyalaya, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,"['0 (7-hydroxyfrullanolide)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sitosterols)', '5LI01C78DD (gamma-sitosterol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Asteraceae/*chemistry', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reishi/chemistry', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sitosterols/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Urtica dioica/chemistry']",2012/08/24 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1534735412451997 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735412451997 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2013 May;12(3):236-47. doi: 10.1177/1534735412451997.

Molecular studies require adequate fresh material and are typically performed on a dedicated aspirate specimen, which may not be available in all cases. Prior flow cytometric studies have suggested an association between CD123 overexpression in AML and FLT3-ITD and/or NPM1 mutations; however, the immunohistochemical (IHC) correlate is unknown. We assessed CD123 IHC expression in 157 AML bone marrow biopsies and/or marrow particle preparations, and correlated with the morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features and with the presence of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations. We found that CD123 IHC expression, seen in 40% of AML, occurred across a wide spectrum of 2008 World Health Organization subtypes and was most frequent within the intermediate risk group. As compared with CD123 IHC-AML, CD123 IHC+AML demonstrated higher marrow blast percentages (median 69%), monocytic differentiation (33/63 cases), and CD34 negativity (29/63 cases). Eighty-three percent (25/30) FLT3-ITD-mutated AML were CD123+ (P<0.0001) and 62% (18/29) NPM1-mutated cases were CD123 IHC+ (P=0.0052) with negative predictive values of 95% for FLT3-ITD and 88% for NPM1.

CXCR4 expression appears to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in a heterogeneous group of AML patients. To better assess its significance, we analyzed CXCR4 expression in a group of AML patients. METHODS: The prognostic value of CXCR4 expression in 53 patients with AML presenting between 2003 and 2008 was analyzed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy or clot sections were stained using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: CXCR4 was expressed in 26 patients (49.1%). A patient age of less than 60 years (P=0.023), achievement of complete remission after induction therapy (P<0.001), and no CXCR4 expression (P=0.010) were all associated with better progression-free survival (PFS). Among mutations of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3 ITD, and FLT3 D835 and expression of CXCR4, only CXCR4 expression was associated with PFS (P=0.010; by log-rank test). By multivariate analysis, CXCR4 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.001 for PFS and P=0.001 for overall survival). CXCR4 expression in patients with a normal karyotype was detected in 15 of 22 patients (68.2%, relative ratio 4.46, P=0.035). Expression of CXCR4 in normal-karyotype AML showed inferior PFS (median 2.0 vs. 10.7 mo, P=0.026) and had a trend toward inferior overall survival (median 10.8 vs. 14.0 mo, P=0.058). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CXCR4 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with AML. Specifically, CXCR4 expression is common in normal-karyotype AML and is a marker of more aggressive disease in this population. CXCR4 expression could be incorporated into the risk assessment of patients with AML.","['Ahn, Jeong Yeal', 'Seo, Katie', 'Weinberg, Olga K', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Ahn JY', 'Seo K', 'Weinberg OK', 'Arber DA']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/immunology/*metabolism', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/05/18 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e3182606f4d [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2013 Jan;21(1):79-84. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3182606f4d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a G80A polymorphism has been described in the RFC1. This study evaluated the effect of the G80A polymorphism in the RFC1 gene on survival and risk of relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. An association between the polymorphism and risk of relapse was found (P < 0.05). Patients with the G/A genotype have 3.97 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-14.06) and carriers of the A/A genotype have 7.84 (95% confidence interval, 1.66-37.10) higher chance of a relapse. Other variables such as age and leukocyte count were associated (P < 0.05) with the risk of relapse of disease. Individuals with G/A or A/A genotypes had poorer survival (log-rank test, P = < 0.05).

However, a frequent and unfortunate side-effect of cancer therapy is a long-term decline in neurocognitive function. Specifically, cranial radiation therapy markedly alters memory processes, while chemotherapeutic agents are correlated with deficits in attention, concentration, and speed of information processing. Here, we describe the putative cellular etiologies of cancer treatment-induced cognitive decline, with an emphasis on the role of neural stem and precursor cell dysfunction. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies highlight the lasting effects of chemotherapy on memory, executive function, attention, and speed of information processing up to 20 years following chemotherapy. Cognitive decrements are associated with decreased white-matter integrity as well as alterations in stem cell function in humans and rodent models of cancer therapy. Genetic polymorphisms may underlie differential sensitivity of certain individuals to the neurological consequences of chemotherapy. Increasing data support the concept that disruption of normal neural stem and precursor cell function is an important causative factor for the cognitive deficits that result from cancer therapy in both children and adults. SUMMARY: Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of chemotherapy on cell-intrinsic processes and cellular microenvironments. Further, the effects of the new generation of targeted molecular therapies on neural stem and progenitor cell function remains largely untested. Understanding the mechanisms behind cancer therapy-induced damage to neural stem and precursor cell populations will elucidate neuroprotective and cell replacement strategies aimed at preserving cognition after cancer therapy.","['Gibson, Erin', 'Monje, Michelle']","['Gibson E', 'Monje M']","['Division of Neuro-oncology, Department of Neurology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cognition/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Memory Disorders/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Neural Stem Cells/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/physiopathology']",2012/08/24 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283571a8e [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2012 Nov;24(6):672-8. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283571a8e.,,"['5K08NS07092602/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025744/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same natural compound and ethyl acetate extract inhibited oxidation induced by 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells with respectively 50% inhibitory concentration values of 0.225 mg/ml and 0.31 mg/ml, reflecting a significant antioxidant potential. The same two products inhibited the genotoxicity induced by hydroxyl radicals in the same human cell line (by 77.77% at a concentration of 800 mug/ml and by 80.55% at a concentration of 1000 mug/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The isorhamnetin 3- o-robinobioside and its original extract, the ethyl acetate extract, from Nitraria retusa leaves, have a great antioxidant and antigenotoxic potential on human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562.","['Boubaker, Jihed', 'Ben Sghaier, Mohammed', 'Skandrani, Ines', 'Ghedira, Kamel', 'Chekir-Ghedira, Leila']","['Boubaker J', 'Ben Sghaier M', 'Skandrani I', 'Ghedira K', 'Chekir-Ghedira L']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Dental Medicine, University of Monastir, Rue Avicenne, Monastir 5000, Tunisia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '0 (isorhamnetin 3-O-robinobioside)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Antimutagenic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Glycosides/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Magnoliopsida/*chemistry', 'Nigeria', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quercetin/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism']",2012/08/24 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-12-135 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-12-135 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2012 Aug 22;12:135. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-12-135.,PMC3439276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The greatest accumulation of 2-chloroadenosine triphosphate is in the most active cells, where activating (phosphorylation) enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase, has the highest activity, whereas inactivating enzyme (dephosphorylation), cytoplasmic 5-nucleotidase, has the lowest activity. A very good ratio of the both enzymes for high effectiveness of cladribine is in resting and proliferating lymphocytes. Therefore, cladribine is an effective medication for hairy cell leukemia, Waldenstrom macroglo-bulinemia but also for chronic -B-lymphocytic leukemia. However, such high concentrations of 2-chloroadenosine triphosphate are reached in some cells of histiocytic lines, in monocytes and also in Langerhans dendritic cells. That's why cladribine is highly effective medication in treating Langerhans cell histiocytosis and also in treating diseases of the juvenile xanthogranuloma group. In the paper we present a survey of published experience with cladribine in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The effectiveness of cladribine in the childhood form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is investigated only in 1 multicentric clinical study, other data are taken from single case reports or small series studies. Cladribine was used in 60 adult patients altogether and in 51 of them (85%) treatment response (CR + PR) was achieved. In the group of childhood patients cladribine was used in 182 cases and treatment response (CR + PR) was reached in 110 (60.4%) thereof. One possible explanation for a higher number of therapy responses in adults is lower Langerhans cell histiocytosis aggressiveness in adults than in children. Another explanation is the fact that therapy responses in adults are summarized only from case reports and smaller cohorts, whereas in children, case reports and also results of a prospective randomized clinical study are included. Diseases of the juvenile xanthogranuloma group are much more rare than Langerhans cell histiocytosis and so the number of publications is smaller. In total, 7 publications describe therapy response of cladribine in some of the juvenile xanthogranuloma forms (Erdheim-Chester disease, disseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma and localized form of plane xanthoma type). Cladribine was also effective in CNS infiltration by Langerhans cell histiocytosis cells or juvenile xanthogranuloma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine is a highly effective medication used in treating Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is very good tolerated in monotherapy. Therefore, it is suitable for initial therapy of adults with multifocal or multisystem form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Furthermore, it has the use in treating relapses after some other initial therapy. According to published experience, it is an effective drug for diseases of the juvenile xanthogranuloma group (Erdheim-Chester disease, diffuse juvenile xanthogranuloma and also Rosai-Dorfman disease).","['Adam, Z', 'Szturz, P', 'Pour, L', 'Krejci, M', 'Zahradova, L', 'Tomiska, M', 'Kral, Z', 'Koukalova, R', 'Rehak, Z', 'Mayer, J']","['Adam Z', 'Szturz P', 'Pour L', 'Krejci M', 'Zahradova L', 'Tomiska M', 'Kral Z', 'Koukalova R', 'Rehak Z', 'Mayer J']","['Intrni hematoonkologicka klinika Lekarske fakulty MU a FN Brno, pracoviste Bohunice. z.adam@fnbrno.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Xanthogranuloma, Juvenile/drug therapy']",2012/08/24 06:00,2012/10/06 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['38480 [pii]'],ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2012 Jun;58(6):455-65.,,,,,,,Kladribin je velmi ucinnym lekem pro lecbu histiocytozy z Langerhansovych bunek a vzacnych histiocytarnich nemoci ze skupiny juvenilniho xantogranulomu.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to investigate the distribution pattern of plasma activity level of anticoagulant protein such as proteins C and S, antithrombin, activated protein C resistance (APCR-V) and D-dimer in patients with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied thirty patients with confirmed ALL admitted in Shafa Hospital Hematology-Oncology and Thalassemia-Hemoglobinopathy Research Center and thirty normal (age and sex matched) subjects as control group. Proteins C and S, antithrombin, APCR-V were measured by coagulation analyzer and D-dimer analysed with Asserachrom D-Di enzyme immunoassay kit in patients and control group. RESULTS: The mean activity levels of protein C (p = 0.017) and antithrombin (p = 0.014) were significantly lower in patient to group compared to the control group. However, the patient group had significantly elevated mean levels of protein S (p = 0.004) and D-dimer (p = 0.0001) compared to the control grup. About 3% of patients had APCR-V. There was no significant difference in APCR-V found between patient and control group (p = 0.674). CONCLUSIONS: The hypercoagulability in ALL patients may attribute to the low levels of protein C and antithrombin and the high level of protein S and D-dimer. According to our findings, the use of suitable anticoagulant therapy as a prophylactic measure can be proposed.","['Jalali, M T', 'Khosravi, M', 'Keikhaei, B', 'Dehuori, F', 'Latifi, M']","['Jalali MT', 'Khosravi M', 'Keikhaei B', 'Dehuori F', 'Latifi M']","['Department of Laboratory Sciences, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Shafa Hospital, Ahwaz Jondi Shapour University of Medical Sciences, Ahwaz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (Protein S)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants/*blood', 'Antithrombins/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Protein C/analysis', 'Protein S/analysis']",2012/08/24 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2012 Aug;16(8):1045-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FINDINGS: We developed a real-time PCR array capable of simultaneously detecting eight human viral pathogens: human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and -2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and -2 (HTLV-1 and -2), vaccinia virus (VACV) and West Nile virus (WNV). One hundred twenty (120) primers were designed using a combination of bioinformatics approaches, and, after experimental testing, 24 primer sets targeting eight viral pathogens were selected to set up the array with SYBR Green chemistry. The specificity and sensitivity of the virus-specific primer sets selected for the array were evaluated using analytical panels with known amounts of viruses spiked into human plasma. The array detected: 10 genome equivalents (geq)/ml of HIV-2 and HCV, 50 geq of HIV-1 (subtype B), HBV (genotype A) and WNV. It detected 100-1,000 geq/ml of plasma of HIV-1 subtypes (A - G), group N and CRF (AE and AG) isolates. Further evaluation with a panel consisting of 28 HIV-1 and HIV-2 clinical isolates revealed no cross-reactivity of HIV-1 or HIV-2 specific primers with another type of HIV. All 28 viral isolates were identified with specific primer sets targeting the most conserved genome areas. The PCR array correctly identified viral infections in a panel of 17 previously quantified clinical plasma samples positive for HIV-1, HCV or HBV at as low as several geq per PCR reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The viral array described here demonstrated adequate performance in the testing of donors' clinical samples. Further improvement in its sensitivity for the broad spectrum of HIV-1 subtypes is under development.","['Pripuzova, Natalia', 'Wang, Richard', 'Tsai, Shien', 'Li, Bingjie', 'Hung, Guo-Chiuan', 'Ptak, Roger G', 'Lo, Shyh-Ching']","['Pripuzova N', 'Wang R', 'Tsai S', 'Li B', 'Hung GC', 'Ptak RG', 'Lo SC']","['Tissue Microbiology Laboratory, Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies, Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapy, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120817,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Quinolines)', '163795-75-3 (SYBR Green I)']",IM,"['Benzothiazoles', 'Blood-Borne Pathogens/*isolation & purification', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Diamines', 'HIV/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis Viruses/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Quinolines', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Virus Diseases/*diagnosis', 'West Nile virus/*genetics/isolation & purification']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043246 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-10771 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43246. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043246.

Historically, RNA obtained from slides is limited in utility because of their low quality and highly fragmented nature. MicroRNAs are small ( approximately 22 nt) non-coding RNA that regulate gene expression, and are speculated to preserve well in FFPE tissue. Here we investigate the use of archived bone marrow aspirate slides for miRNA expression analysis in paediatric leukaemia. After determining the optimal method of miRNA extraction, we used TaqMan qRT-PCR to identify reference miRNA for normalisation of other miRNA species. We found hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-26b to be the most stably expressed between lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary bone marrow aspirates and archived samples. We found the average fold change in expression of hsa-miR-26b and two miRNA reportedly dysregulated in leukaemia (hsa-miR-128a, hsa-miR-223) was <0.5 between matching archived slide and bone marrow aspirates. Differential expression of hsa-miR-128a and hsa-miR-223 was observed between leukaemic and non-leukaemic bone marrow from archived slides or flash frozen bone marrow. The demonstration that archived bone marrow aspirate slides can be utilized for miRNA expression studies offers tremendous potential for future investigations into the role miRNA play in the development and long term outcome of hematologic, as well as non-hematologic, diseases.","['Morenos, Leah', 'Saffery, Richard', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Ashley, David', 'Elwood, Ngaire', 'Craig, Jeffrey M', 'Wong, Nicholas C']","['Morenos L', 'Saffery R', 'Mechinaud F', 'Ashley D', 'Elwood N', 'Craig JM', 'Wong NC']","[""Cancer and Disease Epigenetics, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. leah.morenos@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN26A microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Preservation/methods', 'Transcriptome']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0042951 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-05868 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e42951. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0042951.

Although in vitro studies of PKCtheta(-/-) T cells have shown impaired activation responses, in vivo studies indicate that PKCtheta requirement is not universal. While PKCtheta is important in induction of experimentally induced autoimmune diseases in mice and generation of Th2 responses, it is not essential for induction of T cell proliferative and cytotoxic responses against influenza virus, LCMV, and vaccinia virus. The context-specific involvement of PKCtheta in T cell responses suggests that inhibition of PKCtheta may be beneficial in some but not all situations. In the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) setting, we have shown that graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) cannot be induced in the absence of PKCtheta. However, graft-versus-leukemia effects and T cell ability to clear virus infection remains intact. Therefore, PKCtheta is a potential therapeutic target in BMT, inhibition of which may prevent GVHD while retaining anti-tumor and anti-infection responses.","['Bronk, Crystina C', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong', 'Beg, Amer A']","['Bronk CC', 'Yu XZ', 'Beg AA']","['Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120814,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2012/08/23 06:00,2012/08/23 06:01,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2012.00259 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2012 Aug 14;3:259. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00259. eCollection 2012.,PMC3418525,['R01 AI082685/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell activation', 'alloreactivity', 'anti-tumor effect', 'graft-versus-host-disease', 'protein kinase C']",,,,,,,

Treatment of mice with IFN-alpha11 during Friend retrovirus infection (FV) significantly reduced viral loads and resulted in long-term protection from virus-induced leukemia. The effect of IFN-alpha11 on NK cells was direct and signaled through the type I IFN receptor. Furthermore, IFN-alpha11-mediated activation of NK cells enabled cytolytic killing of FV-infected target cells via the exocytosis pathway. Depletion and adoptive transfer experiments illustrated that NK cells played a major role in successful IFN-alpha11 therapy. Additional experiments with Mouse Cytomegalovirus infections demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha11 is not restricted to retroviruses. The type I IFN subtypes 2 and 5, which bind the same receptor as IFN-alpha11, did not elicit similar antiviral effects.

During latency the genomes of these viruses are intimately interacting with the cell nucleus environment. A hallmark of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency establishment is the shutdown of lytic genes expression and the concomitant induction of the latency associated (LAT) transcripts. Although the setting up and the maintenance of the latent genetic program is most likely dependent on a subtle interplay between viral and nuclear factors, this remains uninvestigated. Combining the use of in situ fluorescent-based approaches and high-resolution microscopic analysis, we show that HSV-1 genomes adopt specific nuclear patterns in sensory neurons of latently infected mice (28 days post-inoculation, d.p.i.). Latent HSV-1 genomes display two major patterns, called ""Single"" and ""Multiple"", which associate with centromeres, and with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) as viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (DCP-NBs). 3D-image reconstruction of DCP-NBs shows that PML forms a shell around viral genomes and associated Daxx and ATRX, two PML partners within PML-NBs. During latency establishment (6 d.p.i.), infected mouse TGs display, at the level of the whole TG and in individual cells, a substantial increase of PML amount consistent with the interferon-mediated antiviral role of PML. ""Single"" and ""Multiple"" patterns are reminiscent of low and high-viral genome copy-containing neurons. We show that LAT expression is significantly favored within the ""Multiple"" pattern, which underlines a heterogeneity of LAT expression dependent on the viral genome copy number, pattern acquisition, and association with nuclear domains. Infection of PML-knockout mice demonstrates that PML/PML-NBs are involved in virus nuclear pattern acquisition, and negatively regulate the expression of the LAT. This study demonstrates that nuclear domains including PML-NBs and centromeres are functionally involved in the control of HSV-1 latency, and represent a key level of host/virus interaction.","['Catez, Frederic', 'Picard, Christel', 'Held, Kathrin', 'Gross, Sylvain', 'Rousseau, Antoine', 'Theil, Diethilde', 'Sawtell, Nancy', 'Labetoulle, Marc', 'Lomonte, Patrick']","['Catez F', 'Picard C', 'Held K', 'Gross S', 'Rousseau A', 'Theil D', 'Sawtell N', 'Labetoulle M', 'Lomonte P']","['Virus and Centromere team, Centre de Genetique et de Physiologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire CNRS, UMR5534, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120809,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Atrx protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centromere/genetics/*metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Genetic Loci/*physiology', 'Genome, Viral/*physiology', 'Herpes Simplex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Rabbits', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Latency/*physiology', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2012/08/23 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002852 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-00913 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(8):e1002852. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002852.

Current treatments for CBF leukemias are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 5-y survival rate of ~50%. We hypothesize that the interaction between RUNX1 and CBFbeta is critical for CBF leukemia and can be targeted for drug development. We developed high-throughput AlphaScreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) methods to quantify the RUNX1-CBFbeta interaction and screen a library collection of 243,398 compounds. Ro5-3335, a benzodiazepine identified from the screen, was able to interact with RUNX1 and CBFbeta directly, repress RUNX1/CBFB-dependent transactivation in reporter assays, and repress runx1-dependent hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. Ro5-3335 preferentially killed human CBF leukemia cell lines, rescued preleukemic phenotype in a RUNX1-ETO transgenic zebrafish, and reduced leukemia burden in a mouse CBFB-MYH11 leukemia model. Our data thus confirmed that RUNX1-CBFbeta interaction can be targeted for leukemia treatment and we have identified a promising lead compound for this purpose.","['Cunningham, Lea', 'Finckbeiner, Steven', 'Hyde, R Katherine', 'Southall, Noel', 'Marugan, Juan', 'Yedavalli, Venkat R K', 'Dehdashti, Seameen Jean', 'Reinhold, William C', 'Alemu, Lemlem', 'Zhao, Ling', 'Yeh, Jing-Ruey Joanna', 'Sood, Raman', 'Pommier, Yves', 'Austin, Christopher P', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Liu, Paul']","['Cunningham L', 'Finckbeiner S', 'Hyde RK', 'Southall N', 'Marugan J', 'Yedavalli VR', 'Dehdashti SJ', 'Reinhold WC', 'Alemu L', 'Zhao L', 'Yeh JR', 'Sood R', 'Pommier Y', 'Austin CP', 'Jeang KT', 'Zheng W', 'Liu P']","['Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120821,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/methods', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Zebrafish']",2012/08/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1200037109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1200037109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Sep 4;109(36):14592-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1200037109.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed whether leukemia neoantigens could be generated from drug-resistant mutations in BCR-ABL after imatinib relapse in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). RESULTS: We computationally predicted that approximately 70 peptides derived from 26 BCR-ABL mutations would bind eight common alleles of MHC class I (IC(50) < 1,000 nmol/L). Seven of nine imatinib-resistant CML patients were predicted to generate at least 1 peptide that binds autologous HLA alleles. We predicted and confirmed that an E255K mutation-derived peptide would bind HLA-A3 with high affinity (IC(50) = 28 nmol/L), and showed that this peptide is endogenously processed and presented. Polyfunctional E255K-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in two imatinib-resistant HLA-A3+ CML patients concurrent with an effective anti-CML response to further therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro studies support the hypothesis that leukemia-driven genetic alterations are targeted by the immune system in association with a clinical response, and suggest the possibility of immunizing relapsed patients with CML against newly acquired tumor neoantigens.","['Cai, Ann', 'Keskin, Derin B', 'DeLuca, David S', 'Alonso, Anselmo', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Zhang, Guang Lan', 'Hammond, Naa Norkor', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Sidney, John', 'Brusic, Vladimir', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Cai A', 'Keskin DB', 'DeLuca DS', 'Alonso A', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang GL', 'Hammond NN', 'Nardi V', 'Stone RM', 'Neuberg D', 'Sidney J', 'Brusic V', 'Wu CJ']","['Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120821,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peptides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-1182 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1182 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Oct 15;18(20):5761-72. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1182.

METHODS: This matched case-control study was conducted on children less than 15 years affected by acute leukemia from March 20, 2003 to March 20, 2009. Two control groups were selected, one from hospital and the other from the study population. Cases and controls were matched on age and sex. Logistic regression model was used for data analysis. RESULTS: This study was done on 130 patients, 108 (83.1%) were affected by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and 22 (16.9%) by Acute Myeloblastic Leuke-mia. Seventy two of the patients were male (55.4%) and 58 were female (44.6%).

Duplication of the BST-2 gene has been observed in sheep and the paralogues are referred to as ovine BST-2A and BST2-B, although only a single gene corresponding to BST-2 has been identified in most species. In this study, we identified three isoforms of bovine BST-2, named bBST-2A1, bBST-2A2 and bBST-2B, in bovine cells treated with type I interferon, but not in untreated cells. Both bBST-2A1 and bBST-2A2 are posttranslationally modified by N-linked glycosylation and a GPI-anchor as well as hBST-2, while bBST-2B has neither of these modifications. Exogenous expression of bBST-2A1 or bBST-2A2 markedly reduced the production of bovine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus from cells, while the antiviral activity of bBST-2B was much weaker than those of bBST-2A1 and bBST-2A2.

Although associated with lymphocytosis, HTLV-2 infection is not associated with any malignant hematological disease. Similarly, no infection-related symptom has been detected in HTLV-3-infected individuals studied so far. Differences in individual Tax transcriptional activity might account for these distinct physiopathological outcomes. Tax-1 and Tax-3 possess a PDZ binding motif in their sequence. Interestingly, this motif, which is critical for Tax-1 transforming activity, is absent from Tax-2. We used the DNA microarray technology to analyze and compare the global gene expression profiles of different T- and non T-cell types expressing Tax-1, Tax-2 or Tax-3 viral transactivators. In a T-cell line, this analysis allowed us to identify 48 genes whose expression is commonly affected by all Tax proteins and are hence characteristic of the HTLV infection, independently of the virus type. Importantly, we also identified a subset of genes (n = 70) which are specifically up-regulated by Tax-1 and Tax-3, while Tax-1 and Tax-2 shared only 1 gene and Tax-2 and Tax-3 shared 8 genes. These results demonstrate that Tax-3 and Tax-1 are closely related in terms of cellular gene deregulation. Analysis of the molecular interactions existing between those Tax-1/Tax-3 deregulated genes then allowed us to highlight biological networks of genes characteristic of HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 infection. The majority of those up-regulated genes are functionally linked in biological processes characteristic of HTLV-1-infected T-cells expressing Tax such as regulation of transcription and apoptosis, activation of the NF-kappaB cascade, T-cell mediated immunity and induction of cell proliferation and differentiation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that, in T- and non T-cells types, Tax-3 is a functional analogue of Tax-1 in terms of transcriptional activation and suggest that HTLV-3 might share pathogenic features with HTLV-1 in vivo.","['Chevalier, Sebastien A', 'Durand, Stephanie', 'Dasgupta, Arindam', 'Radonovich, Michael', 'Cimarelli, Andrea', 'Brady, John N', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A']","['Chevalier SA', 'Durand S', 'Dasgupta A', 'Radonovich M', 'Cimarelli A', 'Brady JN', 'Mahieux R', 'Pise-Masison CA']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America. sebastien.chevalier@ens-lyon.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120720,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 3/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0041003 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-05773 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(7):e41003. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0041003.

We analyzed mtDNA sequences from 15 patients with AA. The samples were obtained from bone marrow, and patients' oral epithelial cells were collected for normal tissue comparison. Total DNA was amplified by PCR after extraction, and these segments were then sent for sequencing. The results were compared with those of oral epithelial tissues as well as mtDNA sequences in the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) database. We detected 61 heteroplasmic mutations in 11 genes, including those encoding NADH dehydrogenase (ND)1-2 and 4-6, tRNA glutamic acid (TRNE), ribosomal RNA (RNR) 1 and 2, cytochrome c oxidase (COX1), cytochrome b (CYTB), and tRNA glycine (TRNG); mutation rates were particularly high in ND2 (34.4%) and ND4 (21.3%) in the patients' mtDNA genomes. The products of these genes are involved in oxidation in the respiratory chain, and a large number of homoplasmic mutations were found. Interestingly, these 162 polymorphisms were mostly in the D-loop DNA structure (54.3%), in which numerous mutations associated with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes are found. We conclude that functional impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain induced by mutation may be an important reason for hematopoietic failure in AA patients.","['Cui, X', 'Liu, F', 'Wang, J Q', 'Zhang, W J', 'Wang, J Y', 'Liu, K', 'Cui, S Y', 'Zhang, J', 'Xu, R R']","['Cui X', 'Liu F', 'Wang JQ', 'Zhang WJ', 'Wang JY', 'Liu K', 'Cui SY', 'Zhang J', 'Xu RR']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China. cdz45@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120806,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Genes, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2012/08/23 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr2182 [pii]', '10.4238/2012.August.6.16 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2012 Aug 6;11(3):2130-7. doi: 10.4238/2012.August.6.16.,,,,,,['Genet Mol Res. 2012;11(4):4668-70; author reply 4671.

The myeloid leukemogenic activity of MYC has been demonstrated in different murine models. Not surprisingly, MYC has been found to be amplified or/and deregulated in the three major types of myeloid neoplasms: acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia.

However, the potential benefit of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) according to the NPM1/FLT3-ITD status has been poorly studied in AML patients with a normal karyotype (NK). Therefore, we evaluated the NPM1/FLT3-ITD molecular status in 135 NK-AML patients treated by allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), auto-HSCT, or chemotherapy as consolidation therapy within the GOELAMS LAM-2001 trial. In univariate analyzes, 4-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher for NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- patients compared with patients presenting another molecular profile (61 vs. 43% and 72 vs. 48%, P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). In the NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- subgroup, there was no benefit for allo-HSCT or auto-HSCT vs. chemotherapy (4-year LFS: 71, 56, and 60%; 4-year OS: 73, 71, and 60%, respectively; P = NS). For patients with other NPM1/FLT3-ITD molecular profiles, allo-HSCT was found to be the best consolidation therapy, whereas auto-HSCT was associated with a better outcome when compared with chemotherapy (allo-HSCT-, auto-HSCT-, and chemotherapy-related 4-year LFS: 68, 44, and 36%, P = 0.004; 4-year OS: 68, 52, and 29%, respectively, P = 0.02). Our study indicates that allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT provide similar outcomes compared with chemotherapy as consolidation for NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- NK-AML patients.

METHODS: To identify susceptibility immune genes, we conducted a 2-stage analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 1,253 genes using the Immune and Inflammation Panel. In Stage 1, we genotyped 7,670 SNPs in 425 NHL cases and 465 controls, and in Stage 2 we genotyped the top 768 SNPs on an additional 584 cases and 768 controls. The association of individual SNPs with NHL risk from a log-additive model was assessed using the OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, only the TAP2 coding SNP rs241447 (minor allele frequency = 0.26; Thr655Ala) at 6p21.3 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) achieved statistical significance after accounting for multiple testing (P = 3.1 x 10(-5)). The TAP2 SNP was strongly associated with follicular lymphoma (FL, OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.46-2.26; p = 6.9 x 10(-8)), and was independent of other known loci (rs10484561 and rs2647012) from this region. The TAP2 SNP was also associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77; P = 0.011), but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.32). Higher TAP2 expression was associated with the risk allele in both FL and DLBCL tumors. CONCLUSION: Genetic variation in TAP2 was associated with NHL risk overall, and FL risk in particular, and this was independent of other established loci from 6p21.3. IMPACT: Genetic variation in antigen presentation of HLA class I molecules may play a role in lymphomagenesis.","['Cerhan, James R', 'Fredericksen, Zachary S', 'Novak, Anne J', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Liebow, Mark', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Cunningham, Julie M', 'Wang, Alice H', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Asmann, Yan W', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Cerhan JR', 'Fredericksen ZS', 'Novak AJ', 'Ansell SM', 'Kay NE', 'Liebow M', 'Dogan A', 'Cunningham JM', 'Wang AH', 'Witzig TE', 'Habermann TM', 'Asmann YW', 'Slager SL']","['Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. cerhan.james@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120821,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Female', 'Genetic Loci', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2012/08/23 06:00,2012/12/28 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-0696 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0696 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Oct;21(10):1799-806. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0696.

To develop transgenesis as a functional approach for these pathogens, we previously demonstrated that pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) can transduce schistosomes leading to chromosomal integration of reporter transgenes and short hairpin RNA cassettes. Here we investigated vertical transmission of transgenes through the developmental cycle of S. mansoni after introducing transgenes into eggs. Although MLV infection of schistosome eggs from mouse livers was efficient in terms of snail infectivity, >10-fold higher transgene copy numbers were detected in cercariae derived from in vitro laid eggs (IVLE). After infecting snails with miracidia from eggs transduced by MLV, sequencing of genomic DNA from cercariae released from the snails also revealed the presence of transgenes, demonstrating that transgenes had been transmitted through the asexual developmental cycle, and thereby confirming germline transgenesis. High-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA from schistosome populations exposed to MLV mapped widespread and random insertion of transgenes throughout the genome, along each of the autosomes and sex chromosomes, validating the utility of this approach for insertional mutagenesis. In addition, the germline-transmitted transgene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase rescued cultured schistosomules from toxicity of the antibiotic G418, and PCR analysis of eggs resulting from sexual reproduction of the transgenic worms in mice confirmed that retroviral transgenes were transmitted to the next (F1) generation. These findings provide the first description of wide-scale, random insertional mutagenesis of chromosomes and of germline transmission of a transgene in schistosomes. Transgenic lines of schistosomes expressing antibiotic resistance could advance functional genomics for these significant human pathogens.

We compare cancer survival between Eastern and Western Germany in the early twenty-first century, i.e. the second decade after the German reunification. Using data from 11 population-based cancer registries covering a population of 33 million people, 5-year age-standardized relative survival for the time period 2002-2006 was estimated for the 25 most common cancers using model-based period analysis. In 2002-2006, 5-year relative survival was very similar for most cancers, with differences below 3% units for 20 of 25 cancer sites. Larger, statistically significant survival advantages were seen for oral cavity, oesophagus, and gallbladder cancer and skin melanoma in the West and for leukemia in the East. Our study shows that within two decades after the assimilation of political and health care systems, the former major survival gap of cancer patients in Eastern Germany has been essentially overcome. This result is encouraging as it suggests that, even though economic conditions have remained difficult in Eastern Germany, comparable health care provision may nevertheless enable comparable levels of cancer survival within a relatively short period of time.","['Jansen, Lina', 'Gondos, Adam', 'Eberle, Andrea', 'Emrich, Katharina', 'Holleczek, Bernd', 'Katalinic, Alexander', 'Brenner, Hermann']","['Jansen L', 'Gondos A', 'Eberle A', 'Emrich K', 'Holleczek B', 'Katalinic A', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. l.jansen@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany, East/epidemiology', 'Germany, West/epidemiology', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Political Systems', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', '*Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10654-012-9723-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2012 Sep;27(9):689-93. doi: 10.1007/s10654-012-9723-5.

This study was designed to investigate the role of the myocardial performance index (MPI) and serum concentrations of biomarkers (cTnT and NT-pro-BNP) in the early detection of subclinical anthracycline-induced functional alterations in children with ALL. METHODS: All children consecutively admitted to our Pediatric Oncologic Department from January 2009 to October 2010 with a diagnosis of ALL were enrolled in this study. cTnT and NT-pro-BNP were evaluated in all patients at diagnosis, before doxorubicin therapy and 2 and 24 h following each anthracycline administration. ECG and echocardiography were performed at diagnosis and 24 h after each anthracycline course. RESULTS: Nineteen children with standard-risk ALL were evaluated. The mean age was 6 years. The cumulative doxorubicin dosage was 240 mg/m(2) according to the AIEOP (Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica) ALL 2000 protocol. None of the 19 patients developed congestive heart failure. With increasing cumulative dosages of anthracyclines a significant increase was observed in MPI. This increase was statistically significant starting from the cumulative dosage of 120 mg/m(2) compared to baseline, while the median NT-pro-BNP level did not change significantly during treatment and cTnT levels never exceeded the cut-off value for cardiac injury. CONCLUSION: MPI value is a sensitive and accurate parameter, allowing subclinical cardiac dysfunction to be detected in children receiving anthracyclines. Lifelong cardiac surveillance of these patients is warranted in order to determine the clinical implications of increased MPI on long-term cardiac status.","['Ruggiero, Antonio', 'De Rosa, Gabriella', 'Rizzo, Daniela', 'Leo, Andrea', 'Maurizi, Palma', 'De Nisco, Alessia', 'Vendittelli, Francesca', 'Zuppi, Cecilia', 'Mordente, Alvaro', 'Riccardi, Riccardo']","['Ruggiero A', 'De Rosa G', 'Rizzo D', 'Leo A', 'Maurizi P', 'De Nisco A', 'Vendittelli F', 'Zuppi C', 'Mordente A', 'Riccardi R']","['Pediatric Oncology Division, ""A.

The screen validated saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and identified two novel anti-IAV agents, obatoclax and gemcitabine. Further experiments demonstrated that Mcl-1 (target of obatoclax) provides a novel host target for IAV treatment. Moreover, we showed that obatoclax and SaliPhe inhibited IAV uptake and gemcitabine suppressed viral RNA transcription and replication. These compounds possess broad spectrum antiviral activity, although their antiviral efficacies were virus-, cell type-, and species-specific.

The expression of these genes is regulated through the same mechanisms, with activation of the p38-MAPK pathway and inhibition of methylation making transcription factors more accessible to activate these genes. We could show that AraG, as well as other NAs, and P-gp substrates could induce global DNA demethylation and induction of Hbgamma and P-gp both at the mRNA and protein expression level. We speculate that the expression of HbF prior to drug exposure or in drug-resistant cell lines is a strategy of the cancer to gain more oxygen, and thereby survival benefits. We also believe that P-gp may be induced in order to excrete Hb degradation products from the cells that would otherwise be toxic. By using Hbgamma siRNA and pharmacological inhibitors of HbF production we here present a possible relationship between HbF induction and multi-drug resistance in a human leukemia cell line model.","['Fyrberg, A', 'Skoglund, K', 'Wolk, M', 'Lotfi, K']","['Fyrberg A', 'Skoglund K', 'Wolk M', 'Lotfi K']","['Centre for Biomedical Resources, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden. anna.fyrberg@liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120811,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/*physiology', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01436-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.129 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Oct 26;427(3):456-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.129.

Recent converging evidence suggests its implication in cancer progression and invasion for several solid tumors, including lung, breast, brain, thyroid, and pancreas. In the last decade, Axl has thus become an attractive target for therapeutic development of more aggressive cancers. An emerging class of therapeutic inhibitors is now represented by short nucleic acid aptamers. These molecules act as high affinity ligands with several advantages over conventional antibodies for their use in vivo, including their small size and negligible immunogenicity. Furthermore, these molecules can easily form conjugates able to drive the specific delivery of interfering RNAs, nanoparticles, or chemotherapeutics. We have thus generated and characterized a selective RNA-based aptamer, GL21.T that binds the extracellular domain of Axl at high affinity (12 nmol/l) and inhibits its catalytic activity. GL21.T blocked Axl-dependent transducing events in vitro, including Erk and Akt phosphorylation, cell migration and invasion, as well as in vivo lung tumor formation in mice xenografts. In this respect, the GL21.T aptamer represents a promising therapeutic molecule for Axl-dependent cancers whose importance is highlighted by the paucity of available Axl-specific inhibitory molecules.","['Cerchia, Laura', 'Esposito, Carla L', 'Camorani, Simona', 'Rienzo, Anna', 'Stasio, Loredana', 'Insabato, Luigi', 'Affuso, Andrea', 'de Franciscis, Vittorio']","['Cerchia L', 'Esposito CL', 'Camorani S', 'Rienzo A', 'Stasio L', 'Insabato L', 'Affuso A', 'de Franciscis V']","['Istituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale, CNR, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120821,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32232-8 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2012.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2012 Dec;20(12):2291-303. doi: 10.1038/mt.2012.163.

Vitamin D3 promotes differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. We analyzed the effect of vitamin D3 on dysferlin expression in vitro using HL60 cells, monocytes and myotubes from controls and carriers of a single mutation in DYSF. We also performed an observational study with oral vitamin D3 in a cohort of 21 carriers. Fifteen subjects were treated for 1 year and dysferlin expression in monocytes was analysed before and after treatment. Treatment with vitamin D3 increased expression of dysferlin in vitro. The effect of vitamin D3 was mediated by both a nongenomic pathway through MEK/ERK and a genomic pathway involving binding of vitamin D3 receptor to the dysferlin promoter. Carriers treated with vitamin D3 had significantly increased expression of dysferlin in monocytes compared with nontreated carriers (P < 0.05). These findings will have important therapeutic implications since a combination of different molecular strategies together with vitamin D3 uptake could increase dysferlin expression to nonpathological protein levels.","['De Luna, Noemi', 'Diaz-Manera, Jordi', 'Paradas, Carmen', 'Iturriaga, Cristina', 'Rojas-Garcia, Ricardo', 'Araque, Josefa', 'Genebriera, Mireia', 'Gich, Ignasi', 'Illa, Isabel', 'Gallardo, Eduard']","['De Luna N', 'Diaz-Manera J', 'Paradas C', 'Iturriaga C', 'Rojas-Garcia R', 'Araque J', 'Genebriera M', 'Gich I', 'Illa I', 'Gallardo E']","['Laboratori de Malalties Neuromusculars, Institut de Recerca Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120821,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (DYSF protein, human)', '0 (Dysferlin)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholecalciferol/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dysferlin', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscle Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Muscular Dystrophies/genetics/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'Prospective Studies', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/metabolism', 'Spain', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32195-5 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2012.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2012 Oct;20(10):1988-97. doi: 10.1038/mt.2012.156.

Within the goal of identifying anticancer agents, new pregnane derivatives were prepared by using a sequence of liquid and solid-phase reactions. After we dehydrated epi-allopregnanolone in one step with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride and generated a 2,3alpha-epoxide, the regio- and stereo-selective aminolysis of this epoxide enabled us to obtain a 2beta-piperazino-pregnane, whose secondary amine was protected as N-Fmoc-derivative. Using the difference in reactivity between OHs 3 and 20, we linked the pregnane nucleus-selectively on the polystyrene diethylbutylsilane resin via the OH in position 20. We next achieved in parallel the coupling of an amino acid (1st level of diversity) and the coupling of a carboxylic acid (2nd level of diversity) to generate two libraries of pregnane derivatives. The compounds inhibited the HL-60 leukemia cell growth and the most potent were three compounds (PD, LPC-37 and LPC-48) with a l-proline as first level of diversity and a cyclohexyl-carbonyl, a naphthalene-2-carbonyl or a 3-acetylbenzoyl as second level of diversity. LPC-48 efficiently inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation with IC(50) value of 1.9 muM and exhibited a low toxicity on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (IC(50)=31 muM).

Such neoplasms often involve recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, among which a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 20 (del20q) is common in myeloid malignancies. The del20q minimum deleted region contains nine genes, including MYBL2, which encodes a key protein involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we show that mice expressing half the normal levels of Mybl2 (Mybl2(+/Delta)) develop a variety of myeloid disorders upon ageing. These include myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplasia (MDS) and myeloid leukaemia, mirroring the human conditions associated with del20q. Moreover, analysis of gene expression profiles from patients with MDS demonstrated reduced levels of MYBL2, regardless of del20q status and demonstrated a strong correlation between low levels of MYBL2 RNA and reduced expression of a subset of genes related to DNA replication and checkpoint control pathways. Paralleling the human data, we found that these pathways are also disturbed in our Mybl2(+/Delta) mice. This novel mouse model, therefore, represents a valuable tool for studying the initiation and progression of haematological malignancies during ageing, and may provide a platform for preclinical testing of therapeutic approaches.","['Clarke, M', 'Dumon, S', 'Ward, C', 'Jager, R', 'Freeman, S', 'Dawood, B', 'Sheriff, L', 'Lorvellec, M', 'Kralovics, R', 'Frampton, J', 'Garcia, P']","['Clarke M', 'Dumon S', 'Ward C', 'Jager R', 'Freeman S', 'Dawood B', 'Sheriff L', 'Lorvellec M', 'Kralovics R', 'Frampton J', 'Garcia P']","['Institute of Biomedical Research, Immunity and Infection Department, Birmingham University School of Medical and Dental Science, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120822,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MYBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mybl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012241 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.241 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):661-70. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.241.

Its effect results from incorporation into DNA with subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation. Unfortunately, Gemcitabine is rapidly metabolized by the so-called cytidine-deaminase which limits its efficacy. Because of extensive deamination by intestinal cells, its oral administration results in very low bioavailability. The aim of this study was to introduce an oral formulation of the drug for the first time and improve its physicochemical properties. Chitosan nanoparticles containing were produced based on ionic gelation method and tripolyphosphate (TPP). Physicochemical properties such as particle size and shape, loading efficiency and release rate were evaluated. Oral absorption of both free and nanoparticle-loaded drugs was measured using the rat intestinal sac model. The Gemcitabine-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were spherical with a mean size of 95+/-8 nm and high drug loading (63%). The nanoparticles showed controlled release pattern characterized by a fast initial release (61%) during the first 8h, followed by slower and continuous release (74.66%).

Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common reasons for stopping treatment with l-asparaginase. Short-term complications of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis include development of pseudocysts and pancreatic necrosis. Long-term complications include chronic pancreatitis and diabetes. The pathophysiology of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis remains to be uncovered. Individual clinical and genetic risk factors have been identified, but they are only weak predictors of pancreatitis. This review explores the definition, possible risk factors, treatment and complications of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis.","['Raja, Raheel Altaf', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth']","['Raja RA', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Frandsen TL']","['The Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, the University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120822,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12016 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Oct;159(1):18-27. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12016.

However, we report a case of spontaneous regression of syndesmophyte development following allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia, who was also diagnosed as having ankylosing spondylitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report presenting the partial radiologic regression of syndesmophytes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old man with active ankylosing spondylitis achieved clinical remission and partial radiological regression of cervical spine syndesmophytes following a peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. Our patient received an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation following a pre-transplantation conditioning regimen of total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide. The donor was a human leukocyte antigen-matched 29-year-old man. Our patient has remained asymptomatic and has received no medication for ankylosing spondylitis for nearly three years. CONCLUSIONS: Several explanations are proposed for the regression of syndesmophytes and clinical improvement in active ankylosing spondylitis observed in our patient, including changes in bone remodeling and immune reconstitution following stem cell transplantation, the effect of immunosuppressive agents, or fluctuation in the natural course of ankylosing spondylitis although further studies are required. The regression of syndesmophytes in ankylosing spondylitis in this case raises the possibility that stem cell transplantation might contribute to the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of the disease.","['Yang, Hae Kyung', 'Moon, Su-Jin', 'Shin, Jae Ho', 'Kwok, Seung-Ki', 'Park, Kyung Su', 'Park, Sung-Hwan', 'Kim, Ho-Youn', 'Ju, Ji Hyeon']","['Yang HK', 'Moon SJ', 'Shin JH', 'Kwok SK', 'Park KS', 'Park SH', 'Kim HY', 'Ju JH']","[""Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St, Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic Institute of Medical Science, The Catholic University of Korea, 505 Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, South Korea. juji@catholic.ac.kr.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120821,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2012/08/23 06:00,2012/08/23 06:01,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-250 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-250 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Aug 21;6:250. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-250.,PMC3459693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with different types of leukaemia and minimum age of 14 years were eligible. Calibrated examiners assessed Seymour index (SI), plaque index (PlI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) and performed an interview. Haematological parameters were obtained from haemogram performed on the same day of the periodontal examinations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were evaluated, which corresponded to an 85% response rate. Periodontal parameters were in agreement with plaque accumulation (PlI 1.28 +/- 0.5, GI 0.74 +/- 0.4, PD 2.27 +/- 0.6, BOP 33%, CAL 2.31 +/- 1.6). PlI and CAL were statistically lower in acute leukaemia (1.13 +/- 0.61 and 1.96 +/- 1.7) in comparison with chronic leukaemia (1.46 +/- 0.44 and 2.74 +/- 1.4). Moreover, older age (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-1.56), higher educational level (CI: -1.94 to -0.64) and smoker (CI: 0.39-1.96) were associated with CAL. Correlation between periodontal and haematological parameters was not observed. Correlations between GI x SI and PD x SI were statistically significant (r(S) = 0.390, p = 0.001; r(S) = 0.517, p = 0.000 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal parameters were consistent with plaque accumulation and did not correlate with haematological parameters irrespective of the leukaemia type.","['Angst, Patricia Daniela Melchiors', 'Dutra, Danilo Antonio Milbradt', 'Moreira, Carlos Heitor Cunha', 'Kantorski, Karla Zanini']","['Angst PD', 'Dutra DA', 'Moreira CH', 'Kantorski KZ']","['Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120821,United States,J Clin Periodontol,Journal of clinical periodontology,0425123,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dental Plaque/*complications', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Female', 'Gingivitis/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Health', 'Periodontal Diseases/*complications/diagnosis', 'Periodontal Index', 'Platelet Count', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/23 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-051X.2012.01936.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Periodontol. 2012 Nov;39(11):1003-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2012.01936.x.

The age-at-exposure is an important risk modifier. Furthermore, it seems that radiation-associated increases in cancer rates persist throughout life. In addition, radiation has similar effects upon first-primary and second-primary cancer risks. A recent report on leukemia mortality suggested that the effect of radiation on leukemia mortality persisted for more than five decades. In addition, a significant dose-response for myelodysplastic syndrome is found in Nagasaki LSS members 40-60 y after radiation exposure.

The activity of this pathway is regulated at multiple levels, with inositol phosphatases PTEN and SHIP both playing critical roles. When deregulated, the PI3K pathway can contribute to B cell malignancies and autoantibody production. This review summarizes current knowledge on key mechanisms that activate and regulate the PI3K pathway and influence normal B cell functional responses including the development of B cell subsets, antigen presentation, immunoglobulin isotype switch, germinal center responses, and maintenance of B cell anergy. We also discuss PI3K pathway alterations reported in select B cell malignancies and highlight studies indicating the functional significance of this pathway in malignant B cell survival and growth within tissue microenvironments.

Perinatal overexpression of the MycN oncoprotein in embryonal cancer precursor cells causes postnatal rests, and later tumor formation through unknown mechanisms. However, overexpression of Myc in adult tissues normally activates apoptosis and/or senescence signals as an organismal defense mechanism against cancer. Here, we show that perinatal neuroblastoma precursor cells exhibited a transiently diminished p53 response to MycN oncoprotein stress and resistance to trophic factor withdrawal, compared with their adult counterpart cells from the TH-MYCN(+/+) transgenic mouse model of neuroblastoma. The adult stem cell maintenance factor and Polycomb group protein, Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site), had a critical role at neuroblastoma initiation in the model, by repressing p53 responses in precursor cells. We further show in neuroblastoma tumor cells that Bmi1 could directly bind p53 in a complex with other Polycomb complex proteins, Ring1A or Ring1B, leading to increased p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Repressed p53 signal responses were also seen in precursor cells for other embryonal cancer types, medulloblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Collectively, these date indicate a general mechanism for p53 inactivation in some embryonal cell types and consequent susceptibility to MycN oncogenesis at the point of embryonal tumor initiation.","['Calao, M', 'Sekyere, E O', 'Cui, H J', 'Cheung, B B', 'Thomas, W D', 'Keating, J', 'Chen, J B', 'Raif, A', 'Jankowski, K', 'Davies, N P', 'Bekkum, M V', 'Chen, B', 'Tan, O', 'Ellis, T', 'Norris, M D', 'Haber, M', 'Kim, E S', 'Shohet, J M', 'Trahair, T N', 'Liu, T', 'Wainwright, B J', 'Ding, H F', 'Marshall, G M']","['Calao M', 'Sekyere EO', 'Cui HJ', 'Cheung BB', 'Thomas WD', 'Keating J', 'Chen JB', 'Raif A', 'Jankowski K', 'Davies NP', 'Bekkum MV', 'Chen B', 'Tan O', 'Ellis T', 'Norris MD', 'Haber M', 'Kim ES', 'Shohet JM', 'Trahair TN', 'Liu T', 'Wainwright BJ', 'Ding HF', 'Marshall GM']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120820,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Medulloblastoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Polyubiquitin/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stress, Physiological', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2012/08/22 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2012/08/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012368 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.368 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Aug 1;32(31):3616-26. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.368.

Thus, inhibition of KIT has been a major focus for treatment of this disorder. Here we investigated a novel approach to such inhibition. Utilizing rational drug design, we targeted the switch pocket (SP) of KIT, which regulates its catalytic conformation. Two SP inhibitors thus identified, DP-2976 and DP-4851, were examined for effects on neoplastic mast cell proliferation and mast cell activation. Autophosphorylation of both wild-type and, where also examined, KIT D816V activation was blocked by these compounds in transfected 293T cells, HMC 1.1 and 1.2 human mast cell lines, and in CD34(+)-derived human mast cells activated by stem cell factor (SCF). Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in the neoplastic mast cell lines and reduced survival of primary bone marrow mast cells from patients with mastocytosis. Moreover, the SP inhibitors more selectively blocked SCF potentiation of FcvarepsilonRI-mediated degranulation. Overall, SP inhibitors represent an innovative mechanism of KIT inhibition whose dual suppression of KIT D816V neoplastic mast cell proliferation and SCF-enhanced mast cell activation may provide significant therapeutic benefits.","['Bai, Y', 'Bandara, G', 'Ching Chan, E', 'Maric, I', 'Simakova, O', 'Bandara, S N', 'Lu, W-P', 'Wise, S C', 'Flynn, D L', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Gilfillan, A M', 'Wilson, T M']","['Bai Y', 'Bandara G', 'Ching Chan E', 'Maric I', 'Simakova O', 'Bandara SN', 'Lu WP', 'Wise SC', 'Flynn DL', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Gilfillan AM', 'Wilson TM']","['Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1881, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20120731,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/08/22 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/08/22 06:00'],"['2012/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012218 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.218 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Feb;27(2):278-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.218.

This study aimed to evaluate the biological and clinical significance of PML in multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: We knocked down PML in myeloma cells with a lentiviral vector expressing microRNA to target PML, which were used for in vitro analyses. We also evaluated the association between PML expression in the bone marrow and patients' clinical parameters. RESULTS: The expression of IL-6 was decreased in myeloma cells with knocked-down PML expression. Immunohistochemical study showed that the PML expression level varied widely in the bone marrow of 48 MM patients, and that IL-6 expression correlated with PML expression in these patients. In addition, MM with high PML expression at diagnosis showed a poor prognosis regarding the 2-year survival, and PML and IL-6 positivity increased with the progression of disease in 13 sequentially analyzed cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PML expression was positively associated with IL-6 expression in patients and was also related to tumor development and resistance to treatment in MM.","['Ohgiya, Daisuke', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Amaki, Jun', 'Aoyama, Yasuyuki', 'Kawai, Hidetsugu', 'Ogawa, Yoshiaki', 'Kawada, Hiroshi', 'Ando, Kiyoshi']","['Ohgiya D', 'Matsushita H', 'Onizuka M', 'Nakamura N', 'Amaki J', 'Aoyama Y', 'Kawai H', 'Ogawa Y', 'Kawada H', 'Ando K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120817,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2012/08/22 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/08/22 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000339486 [pii]', '10.1159/000339486 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;128(4):213-22. doi: 10.1159/000339486.

Previous studies have shown that the withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) results in differentiation of the majority of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into various cell lineages, while some ES cells die within 3days. Thus, to investigate the function of BI-1 in ES cell survival and neuronal differentiation, we generated mES cell lines that overexpress BI-1 or a carboxy-terminal BI-1DeltaC mutant. Overexpression of BI-1 in mES cells significantly increased cell viability and resistance to apoptosis induced by LIF withdrawal, while the control vector or BI-1DeltaC-overexpressing mES cells had no effect. Moreover, overexpression of BI-1 produced significant inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway in response to LIF withdrawal, while activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK pathway was increased. Interestingly, we found that BI-1-overexpressing cells showed higher expression levels of neuroectodermal markers (Otx1, Lmx1b, En1, Pax2, Wnt1, Sox1, and Nestin) and greater neuronal differentiation efficiency than control or BI-1DeltaC-overexpressing mES cells did. Considering these findings, our results indicated that BI-1-modulated MAPK activity plays a key role in protecting mES cells from LIF-withdrawal-induced apoptosis and in promoting their differentiation toward neuronal lineages.","['Jeon, Kilsoo', 'Lim, Hyejin', 'Kim, Jung-Hyun', 'Han, Dawoon', 'Lee, Eung-Ryoung', 'Yang, Gwang-Mo', 'Song, Min-Kyoung', 'Kim, Jin-Hoi', 'Cho, Ssang-Goo']","['Jeon K', 'Lim H', 'Kim JH', 'Han D', 'Lee ER', 'Yang GM', 'Song MK', 'Kim JH', 'Cho SG']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology (BK21), Animal Resources Research Center, and SMART-IABS, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-702, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120812,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tmbim6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/08/22 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/08/22 06:00'],"['2012/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(12)00229-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012 Dec;1823(12):2190-200. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.08.005.

Major research efforts in recent years have been aimed at identifying and characterizing the LSC population in leukemias, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which represents an important paradigm for understanding the molecular evolution of cancer. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that promote LSC-mediated therapeutic recalcitrance have remained elusive. It has become clear that the LSC population evolves during disease progression, thus presenting a serious challenge for development of effective therapeutic strategies. Multiple reports have demonstrated that LSC initiation and propagation occurs as a result of aberrant activation of pro-survival and self-renewal pathways regulated by stem-cell related signaling molecules including beta-catenin and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Enhanced survival in LSC protective microenvironments, such as the bone marrow niche, as well as acquired dormancy of cells in these niches, also contributes to LSC persistence. Key components of these cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic pathways provide novel potential targets for therapies aimed at eradicating this dynamic and therapeutically recalcitrant LSC population. Furthermore, combination strategies that exploit LSC have the potential to dramatically improve the quality and quantity of life for patients that are resistant to current therapies.","['Crews, Leslie A', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M']","['Crews LA', 'Jamieson CH']","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120817,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2012/08/22 06:00,2013/11/07 06:00,['2012/08/22 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(12)00477-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2012.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Sep 10;338(1):15-22. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.08.006.

While there is some evidence that bone formation may be reduced in children after HCT, it is currently unknown whether bone resorption is increased. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in markers of bone resorption over the first six months after pediatric HCT. Twenty-six participants (eight females) aged 10.9 +/- 3.4 yr entered the study prior to HCT. Bone resorption was measured by urine DPD and PYD, and by plasma NTX and CTX. Seventeen participants who completed day +30 visit and either day +100 or +180 visits were included in the analysis. DPD increased between days +30 and +100 (mean change, 11.3 nmol/nmol creatinine; p = 0.012) and between days +30 and +180 (13.7 nmol/nmol creatinine; p = 0.036). PYD increased between days +30 and +100 (32 nmBCE/L; p = 0.019). CTX increased between baseline and day +100 (5.9 mug/L; p = 0.012). Changes in NTX levels were not statistically significant.

Disruption of these vessels can be achieved by inducing vascular endothelial-cell apoptosis. Moreover, endothelial cell apoptosis has been proven to be enhanced by ceramide-increasing drugs. Herein, we introduce a novel therapeutic approach which uses ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles used in combination with radiation to cause a rapid accumulation of ceramide in endothelial cells in-vitro. We also test this modality directly with other cell types as a general method of killing cancer cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML), murine fibrosarcoma cells (KHT-C), prostate cancer cells (PC3), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and astrocytes were used to evaluate this mechanism of inducing cell death. Survival was measured by clonogenic assays, and ceramide content was detected using immunohistochemistry. Exposure of cell types to ultrasound-stimulated bubbles alone resulted in increases in ceramide for all cell types and survivals of 12 +/- 2%, 65 +/- 5%, 83 +/- 2%, 58 +/- 4%, 58 +/- 3%, 18 +/- 7% for HUVEC, AML, PC3, MDA, KHT-C and astrocyte cells, respectively. Results from selected cell types involving radiation treatments indicated additive treatment enhancements and increases in intracellular ceramide content one hour after exposure to ultrasound-activated microbubbles and radiation. Endothelial cell survival decreased from 8 +/- 1% after 2 Gy of radiation treatment alone and from 12 +/- 2% after ultrasound and microbubbles alone, to 1 +/- 1% with combined treatment. In Asmase +/+ astrocytes, survival decreased from 56 +/- 2% after 2 Gy radiation alone and from 17 +/- 7% after ultrasound and microbubbles alone, to 5 +/- 2% when combined. Using ASMase deficient astrocytes (Asmase -/- ) and Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), we also demonstrate that ultrasound-activated microbubbles stimulate ASMase activity and ceramide production. These findings suggest that ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles could be used as a new biomechanical method to enhance the effects of radiation.","['Nofiele, J T', 'Karshafian, R', 'Furukawa, M', 'Al Mahrouki, A', 'Giles, A', 'Wong, S', 'Czarnota, G J']","['Nofiele JT', 'Karshafian R', 'Furukawa M', 'Al Mahrouki A', 'Giles A', 'Wong S', 'Czarnota GJ']","['Radiation Oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120810,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,['0 (Ceramides)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microbubbles', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Ultrasonic Therapy']",2012/08/22 06:00,2013/05/18 06:00,['2012/08/22 06:00'],"['2012/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['product-p17983.html [pii]', '10.7785/tcrt.2012.500253 [doi]']",ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2013 Feb;12(1):53-60. doi: 10.7785/tcrt.2012.500253.

We report the finding of follicular mucinosis in a cutaneous nodule of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The patient was a 69-year-old female of Caribbean descent with a history of ATLL who presented with erythematous nodules on the chest and abdomen. Histopathologic examination showed a pan-dermal infiltrate of medium-to-large sized atypical lymphocytes extending into follicular epithelium where they associated with large mucin deposits. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD4 and CD25 and negative for CD30. Cutaneous lesions of ATLL, which often present histopathologically as an epidermotropic lymphoma with Pautrier-type collections, are often difficult to distinguish from MF.

Interestingly, the past few years have seen the emergence of CD26 as an important diagnostic and prognostic marker for a number of systemic malignancies besides colo-rectal carcinomas. For instance, serum CD26 levels are an important emerging marker of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In fact, Molica et al have recently reported shorter time to first treatment in B-CLL which exhibit higher serum CD26 levels and simultaneously demonstrate absence of mutation in IgV (H). Similarly, CD26 serves as a marker of poor prognosis in T cell lymphomas. Simultaneously, a poor response to 2'-deoxycoformycin is seen T cell lymphomas expressing CD26. Similarly, breast carcinomas exhibit decreased CD26 mean fluorescence intensity and a decreased percentage of CD26 positive lymphocytes in comparison to benign breast tumors and healthy individuals.","['Kapoor, Shailendra']",['Kapoor S'],"['Shailendra Kapoor, Private practice, 7487 Sherwood Crossing place # 302, Mechanicsville, VA 23111, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Clin Oncol,World journal of clinical oncology,101549149,,,,2012/08/21 06:00,2012/08/21 06:01,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5306/wjco.v3.i8.126 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Oncol. 2012 Aug 10;3(8):126-7. doi: 10.5306/wjco.v3.i8.126.,PMC3421025,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD26', 'Cancer', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Colon cancer', 'Marker']",,,,,,,

Thus, we postulated that the NO sibling and thiophylic compound, nitroxyl (HNO), would inhibit LIF-induced JAK-STAT3 activation. Pretreatment of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with the HNO donors Angeli's salt or nitrosocyclohexyl acetate (NCA) inhibited LIF-induced STAT3 activation. NCA pretreatment also blocked the induction of downstream inflammatory genes (e.g. intercellular adhesion molecule 1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta). The related 1-nitrosocyclohexyl pivalate (NCP; not a nitroxyl donor) was equally effective in inhibiting STAT3 activation, suggesting that these compounds act as thiolate targeting electrophiles. The JAK1 redox switch is likely not a target of acyloxy nitroso compounds, as NCA had no effect on JAK1 catalytic activity and only modestly affected JAK1-induced phosphorylation of the LIF receptor. However, pretreatment of recombinant human STAT3 with NCA or NCP reduced labeling of free sulfhydryl residues. We show that NCP in the presence of diamide enhanced STAT3 glutathionylation and dimerization in adult mouse cardiac myocytes and altered STAT3 under non-reducing conditions. Finally, we show that monomeric STAT3 levels are decreased in the Galphaq model of heart failure in a redox-sensitive manner. Altogether, our evidence indicates that STAT3 has redox-sensitive cysteines that regulate its activation and are targeted by HNO donors and acyloxy nitroso compounds. These findings raise the possibility of new therapeutic strategies to target STAT3 signaling via a redox-dependent manner, particularly in the context of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases with prominent pro-inflammatory signaling.","['Zgheib, Carlos', 'Kurdi, Mazen', 'Zouein, Fouad A', 'Gunter, Barak W', 'Stanley, Brian A', 'Zgheib, Joe', 'Romero, Damian G', 'King, S Bruce', 'Paolocci, Nazareno', 'Booz, George W']","['Zgheib C', 'Kurdi M', 'Zouein FA', 'Gunter BW', 'Stanley BA', 'Zgheib J', 'Romero DG', 'King SB', 'Paolocci N', 'Booz GW']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, and Center for Excellence in Cardiovascular-Renal Research, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120815,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle Cells/*cytology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Nitrogen/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/02/12 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043313 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-05740 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43313. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043313.

This pretreatment dramatically increases post-transplant survival of immunocompromised mice injected with primary human bone marrow or peripheral blood cells and prevents the expansion of human CD3(+) lymphocytes in major recipient organs. Similar viral treatment also prevents human-human mixed alloreactive T lymphocyte reactions in vitro.

We sought to model the effects of high MN1 expression in AML models to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used cell lines and a genetically defined mouse model of AML to examine the effects of MN1 overexpression on prognosis and response to cytarabine and doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. Murine AML that was engineered to overexpress MN1 became more aggressive in vivo, leading to shortened survival in both treated and control groups. In vitro murine AML cells that overexpressed MN1 became resistant to treatment with cytarabine and highly resistant to doxorubicin. This resistant phenotype was also seen in vivo, where treatment with the combination of cytarabine and doxorubicin selected for cells expressing MN1. When therapy-induced DNA damage levels were assessed by gammaH2AX foci, no reduction was seen in MN1 expressing cells arguing against a drug efflux mechanism. Despite no reduction in DNA damage, MN1-expressing cells showed less apoptosis as assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Following treatment, p53 and BIM induction were markedly reduced in cells expressing MN1. Pharmacologic inhibition of the p53 E3 ligase MDM2 resulted in increased p53 levels and improved response to doxorubicin in vitro. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MN1 overexpression accelerates an already aggressive leukemia, confers resistance to chemotherapy, and suppresses p53 and BIM induction, resulting in decreased apoptosis. This provides a mechanistic explanation of the poor prognosis observed with high MN1 expression and suggests that therapies directed at increasing p53 function may be useful for these patients.","['Pardee, Timothy S']",['Pardee TS'],"['Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America. tspardee@wakehealth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120814,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/02/12 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0043185 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-01880 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43185. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043185.

Recent research has identified that balanced multi-component therapies might be more efficacious than highly specific single component therapies in certain cases. Ideally, synergistic combinations can provide 1) increased efficacy of the therapeutic effect 2) reduced toxicity as a result of decreased dosage providing equivalent or increased efficacy 3) the avoidance or delayed onset of drug resistance. Therefore, the interest in combinatorial drug discovery based on systems-oriented approaches has been increasing steadily in recent years. METHODOLOGY: Here we describe the development of Combinatorial Drug Assembler (CDA), a genomics and bioinformatics system, whereby using gene expression profiling, multiple signaling pathways are targeted for combinatorial drug discovery. CDA performs expression pattern matching of signaling pathway components to compare genes expressed in an input cell line (or patient sample data), with expression patterns in cell lines treated with different small molecules. Then it detects best pattern matching combinatorial drug pairs across the input gene set-related signaling pathways to detect where gene expression patterns overlap and those predicted drug pairs could likely be applied as combination therapy. We carried out in vitro validations on non-small cell lung cancer cells and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We found two combinatorial drug pairs that showed synergistic effect on lung cancer cells. Furthermore, we also observed that halofantrine and vinblastine were synergistic on TNBC cells. CONCLUSIONS: CDA provides a new way for rational drug combination. Together with phExplorer, CDA also provides functional insights into combinatorial drugs.

Overexpression of the Bcl-2 family members, including Mcl-1, in PCa cells is known to inhibit intracellular mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Here we report the development of a novel transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma by the inducible, conditional knockout of transforming growth factor beta receptor type II in stromal fibroblastic cells (Tgfbr2(ColTKO)). The Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostate epithelia demonstrated down-regulation of luminal and basal differentiation markers, as well as Pten expression and up-regulation of Mcl-1. However, unlike in men, Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostates exhibited no regression acutely after castration. The administration of Sabutoclax (BI-97C1), a pan-active Bcl-2 protein family antagonist mediated apoptosis in castrate-resistant PCa cells of Tgfbr2(ColTKO) mice and human subcutaneous, orthotopic, and intratibial xenograft PCa models. Interestingly, Sabutoclax had little apoptotic effect on benign prostate tissue in Tgfbr2(ColTKO) and wild-type mice. Sabutoclax was able to block c-Met activation, a critical axis in PCa metastatic progression. Further, Sabutoclax synergistically sensitized PC-3 cells to the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel (Taxotere).

Acceleration of CML is usually accompanied by basophilia. Several proangiogenic molecules have been implicated in disease acceleration, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). However, little is known so far about the cellular distribution and function of HGF in CML. We here report that HGF is expressed abundantly in purified CML basophils and in the basophil-committed CML line KU812, whereas all other cell types examined expressed only trace amounts of HGF or no HGF. Interleukin 3, a major regulator of human basophils, was found to promote HGF expression in CML basophils. By contrast, BCR-ABL1 failed to induce HGF synthesis in CML cells, and imatinib failed to inhibit expression of HGF in these cells. Recombinant HGF as well as basophil-derived HGF induced endothelial cell migration in a scratch wound assay, and these effects of HGF were reverted by an anti-HGF antibody as well as by pharmacologic c-Met inhibitors. In addition, anti-HGF and c-Met inhibitors were found to suppress the spontaneous growth of KU812 cells, suggesting autocrine growth regulation.

We show that JQ1 potently reduces the viability of B-ALL cell lines with high-risk cytogenetics. Among the most sensitive were lines with rearrangements of CRLF2, which is overexpressed in ~ 10% of B-ALL. CRLF2 heterodimerizes with the IL7 receptor (IL7R) and signals through JAK2, JAK1, and STAT5 to drive proliferation and suppress apoptosis. As previously observed, JQ1 induced the down-regulation of MYC transcription, the loss of BRD4 at the MYC promoter, and the reduced expression of c-Myc target genes. Strikingly, JQ1 also down-regulated IL7R transcription, depleted BRD4 from the IL7R promoter, and reduced JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated a restricted effect of JQ1 on transcription, with MYC and IL7R being among the most down-regulated genes. Indeed, IL7R was the only cytokine receptor in CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL cells significantly down-regulated by JQ1 treatment. In mice xenografted with primary human CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL, JQ1 suppressed c-Myc expression and STAT5 phosphorylation and significantly prolonged survival. Thus, bromodomain inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for B-ALL as well as other conditions dependent on IL7R signaling.","['Ott, Christopher J', 'Kopp, Nadja', 'Bird, Liat', 'Paranal, Ronald M', 'Qi, Jun', 'Bowman, Teresa', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Bradner, James E', 'Weinstock, David M']","['Ott CJ', 'Kopp N', 'Bird L', 'Paranal RM', 'Qi J', 'Bowman T', 'Rodig SJ', 'Kung AL', 'Bradner JE', 'Weinstock DM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120817,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Azepines/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/08/21 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46340-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-413021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Oct 4;120(14):2843-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-413021.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Endogenous plasma CETP activity was measured in a population of 348 women. We defined a low CETP group corresponding to subjects displaying an endogenous plasma CETP activity within the first tertile and a high CETP group corresponding to subjects with an endogenous plasma CETP activity within the third tertile. Subjects from the high CETP activity group displayed a significant increase in the capacity of their plasma (+8.2%; P=0.001) to mediate cholesterol efflux from human acute monocytic leukemia cell line human macrophages and from ATP-binding cassette transporter A1-dependent pathway (+23.4%; P=0.0001) as compared with those from the low CETP activity group. Multivariate analyses revealed that the impact of CETP activity was independent of plasma lipids levels. Pre-beta1-high-density lipoprotein concentrations were significantly elevated (+29.6%; P=0.01) in the high CETP activity group as compared with the low CETP activity group. A positive correlation between pre-beta1-high-density lipoprotein levels and plasma efflux efficiency from human acute monocytic leukemia cell line human macrophages was observed (r=0.29, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CETP leading to the improvement of plasma efflux capacity, as a result of efficient pre-beta-high-density lipoprotein formation and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 efflux, should be preserved to prevent lipid accumulation in human macrophages.","['Villard, Elise F', 'El Khoury, Petra', 'Duchene, Emilie', 'Bonnefont-Rousselot, Dominique', 'Clement, Karine', 'Bruckert, Eric', 'Bittar, Randa', 'Le Goff, Wilfried', 'Guerin, Maryse']","['Villard EF', 'El Khoury P', 'Duchene E', 'Bonnefont-Rousselot D', 'Clement K', 'Bruckert E', 'Bittar R', 'Le Goff W', 'Guerin M']","[""INSERM UMRS939, Hopital de la Pitie, Pavillon Benjamin Delessert, 83, boulevard de l'Hopital, 75651 Paris Cedex 13, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (CETP protein, human)', '0 (Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/blood', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/01/12 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.112.252841 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.252841 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012 Oct;32(10):2341-9. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.252841.

CLA was expressed in all cases of leukemia whereas CD54 was negative within blasts. CD62-L was expressed in 4 of 10 specimens of marrow infiltrates with MLC and 6 of 10 specimens of matching skin infiltrates; in marrows without MLC, only 2 of 15 were positive.

Regulation of apoptosis is essential for neutrophil homeostasis; however, the molecular signaling that regulates this process needs further investigation. Unlike TLR4 wild-type C3H/HeN mice, TLR4 mutated C3H/HeJ mice were insusceptible to LPS-induced blood neutrophilia. LPS prevented constitutive apoptosis in neutrophils and partly involved a blockade of the mitochondrial pathway including mitochondria transmembrane potential loss, myeloid cell leukemia sequence (Mcl) 1 degradation, and caspase-3 activation. In apoptotic neutrophils, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta was activated, and inhibiting GSK-3beta decreased Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis. LPS caused p38 MAPK-, JNK-, and PI3K/AKT-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization and prevented apoptosis, and LPS induced GSK-3beta inactivation mainly through p38 MAPK and PI3K/AKT. Neutrophils in the neutrophilia showed increased GSK-3beta inactivation and Mcl-1 stabilization accompanied by activation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and AKT. Notably, LPS-induced ROS generation can partly facilitate p38 MAPK/JNK/AKT activation to regulate GSK-3beta-mediated Mcl-1 stability, apoptosis, and neutrophilia. These results demonstrate that the molecular basis of endotoxemic neutrophilia is through a direct action on neutrophils involving GSK-3beta inactivation to prevent constitutive apoptosis.","['Yang, Tsan-Tzu', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Lin, Wei-Chieh', 'Lin, Yee-Shin', 'Tseng, Po-Chun', 'Hsieh, Chia-Yuan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Huang, Wei-Ching', 'Tsai, Cheng-Chieh', 'Wang, Chi-Yun', 'Shieh, Chi-Chang', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Yang TT', 'Chen CL', 'Lin WC', 'Lin YS', 'Tseng PC', 'Hsieh CY', 'Chen YH', 'Huang WC', 'Tsai CC', 'Wang CY', 'Shieh CC', 'Lin CF']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120818,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endotoxemia/*immunology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*immunology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocyte Disorders/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Protein Kinases/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/immunology']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-012-0944-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2013 Feb;91(2):207-17. doi: 10.1007/s00109-012-0944-6.

Other tumours, such as histiocytic sarcoma (HS), haemangiosarcoma and mesothelioma, may also develop. In a previous article we described a case in which myeloid leukosis, haemangiomas and leiomyosarcomas appeared simultaneously in a commercial layer flock with infection by ALV-J. The present research was completed to understand the molecular characteristics of the ALV-J strain that induced clinical myeloid leukosis, haemangiomas and leiomyosarcomas. Two strains of ALV-J (SDAU1001 and SDAU1002) were isolated and identified, and their full-length sequences were analysed. The complete genome nucleotide sequences of these two isolates were different in length, 7652 nt and 7636 nt, respectively. They shared 98.9% identity with each other, and 93.4% to 97.8% nucleotide identity to the reference ALV-J isolates. A 19-nucleotide repeat sequence was identified in the primer binding site (PBS) leader region of isolate SDAU1001. A base substitution mutation (base 15 C-T) in this insertion was identified. However, the identical insertion at the same site was not found in SDAU1002. The gag and pol genes of the two viruses were more conserved than the env gene. One key deletion in the E element was a common feature of SDAU1001 and SDAU1002. SDAU1001 and SDAU1002, possibly recombinants of ALV-J and another avian retrovirus, may share the same ancestor.

This prospective study included 100 adult hematological patients with febrile neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy at the onset of fever (d0) and for 3 days (d1-d3) thereafter. The study aim was to find early predictors for complicated course of febrile neutropenia, defined as bacteremia or septic shock. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) all predicted complicated course of febrile neutropenia on d0, but only PCT was predictive throughout the study period. For IL-10 on d0-1 with cut-off 37 ng/L, sensitivity was 0.71, specificity 0.82, positive predictive value 0.52 and negative predictive value 0.92. For PCT on d0-1 with cut-off 0.13 mug/L, the respective measures were 0.95, 0.53, 0.36, and 0.98. For the combination of IL-10 and PCT on d0-1 with the same cut-offs, specificity improved to 0.85 and positive predictive value to 0.56. In conclusion, the present study confirms the high negative predictive value of PCT and provides new evidence for IL-10 as an early predictor for complicated course of febrile neutropenia in hematological patients. Combining IL-10 with PCT improves the early prediction for complicated course of febrile neutropenia.","['Vanska, Matti', 'Koivula, Irma', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Hamalainen, Sari', 'Purhonen, Anna-Kaisa', 'Pulkki, Kari', 'Juutilainen, Auni']","['Vanska M', 'Koivula I', 'Jantunen E', 'Hamalainen S', 'Purhonen AK', 'Pulkki K', 'Juutilainen A']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, P.O.B. 1777, Puijonlaaksontie 2, 70211 Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120817,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (CALCA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacteremia/*diagnosis', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Calcitonin/*blood/metabolism', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*blood/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/blood/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Precursors/*blood/metabolism', 'Shock, Septic/*diagnosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(12)00605-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2012.07.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2012 Dec;60(3):787-92. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2012.07.023.

Here, we identified that the cell fate determination factor DACH1 is directly up-regulated by MLL-AF9. Recently we showed that the forced expression of DACH1 in myeloid cells induced p27(Kip1) and repressed p21(Cip1), which is a pivotal characteristic of the myeloid progenitor. Consistent with our previous study, ectopic expression of DACH1 contributed to the maintenance of colonogenic activity and blocked the differentiation of myeloid progenitors. Moreover, we here identified an endogenous HOXA9-DACH1 complex mediated by the carboxyl terminus of DACH1 in t(9;11) leukemia cells. qRT-PCR revealed that DACH1 has a stronger transcription-promoting activity with HOXA9 than does PBX2 with HOXA9. Furthermore, C/EBPalpha and GATA-1 can directly bind to the promoter of DACH1 and act as a transcriptional suppressor. Expression of DACH1 is down-regulated during myeloid differentiation and shows an inverse pattern compared to C/EBPalpha and GATA-1 expression. However, ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha and/or GATA-1 could not abrogate the over-expression of DACH1 induced by MLL-AF9. Therefore, we postulate that the inability of C/EBPalpha and GATA-1 to down-regulate DACH1 expression induced by MLL-AF9 during myeloid differentiation may contribute to t(9;11) leukemogenesis.","['Lee, Jae-Woong', 'Kim, Hyeng-Soo', 'Hwang, Junmo', 'Kim, Young Hun', 'Lim, Ga Young', 'Sohn, Wern-Joo', 'Yoon, Suk-Ran', 'Kim, Jae-Young', 'Park, Tae Sung', 'Oh, Seung Hwan', 'Park, Kwon Moo', 'Choi, Sang Un', 'Ryoo, Zae Young', 'Lee, Sanggyu']","['Lee JW', 'Kim HS', 'Hwang J', 'Kim YH', 'Lim GY', 'Sohn WJ', 'Yoon SR', 'Kim JY', 'Park TS', 'Oh SH', 'Park KM', 'Choi SU', 'Ryoo ZY', 'Lee S']","['School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120817,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)', '0 (DACH1 protein, human)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01558-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Sep 28;426(3):299-305. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.048.

Thus far, the contribution of metabolic cues to stem-cell function has not been well understood. Here we identify a previously unknown promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-delta)-fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) pathway for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We have found that loss of PPAR-delta or inhibition of mitochondrial FAO induces loss of HSC maintenance, whereas treatment with PPAR-delta agonists improved HSC maintenance. PML exerts its essential role in HSC maintenance through regulation of PPAR signaling and FAO. Mechanistically, the PML-PPAR-delta-FAO pathway controls the asymmetric division of HSCs. Deletion of Ppard or Pml as well as inhibition of FAO results in the symmetric commitment of HSC daughter cells, whereas PPAR-delta activation increased asymmetric cell division. Thus, our findings identify a metabolic switch for the control of HSC cell fate with potential therapeutic implications.","['Ito, Keisuke', 'Carracedo, Arkaitz', 'Weiss, Dror', 'Arai, Fumio', 'Ala, Ugo', 'Avigan, David E', 'Schafer, Zachary T', 'Evans, Ronald M', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Lee, Chih-Hao', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Ito K', 'Carracedo A', 'Weiss D', 'Arai F', 'Ala U', 'Avigan DE', 'Schafer ZT', 'Evans RM', 'Suda T', 'Lee CH', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (GW 501516)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PPAR delta)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'MSB3DD2XP6 (etomoxir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'PPAR delta/agonists/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2012/08/21 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2882 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2882 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2012 Sep;18(9):1350-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.2882.,PMC3566224,"['P01 HL088093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL105278/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R37 DK057978/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA139009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Nat Med. 2012 Sep;18(9):1334-6.

A unique set of 13 single domain antibodies were selected from an immunized camel phage library based on their target specificity and binding affinity. A combination of these single domain antibodies was used to generate four tumor associated glycoprotein (TAG-72)-specific CARs harboring an identical antigen binding site, but with different signaling and spacer domains. Although all four CARs were functionally active against the TAG-72 expressing tumor cells, the combination of CD3zeta, OX40, CD28 as well as the CH3-CH2-hinge-hinge domains most efficiently triggered T cell activation. Importantly, CAR mediated functions were not blocked by the soluble TAG-72 antigen at a supraphysiological concentration.

The present study evaluated the efficacy of a single dose of granisetron administered throughout the entire period of chemotherapy in AML patients receiving anthracycline and Ara-C combination therapy, and also examined the incidence of constipation during chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 2008 to December 2010, all patients with AML treated using anthracycline and Ara-C combination therapy were registered in the study. This retrospective study investigated the patients' background and the incidence of CINV and constipation from the patients' records. The efficacy of granisetron was measured on each day using the complete regression(no vomiting and no rescue medication; CR)rate. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included in the study(27 male; 18 female), and received a total 68 courses(56 of induction therapy; 12 of consolidation therapy)of the regimens. The CR rate and the incidence of constipation on the final day of chemotherapy were 61. 8% and 63. 2%, respectively. As the duration of chemotherapy increased, the CR rate tended to decrease, whereas the incidence of constipation tended to increase. DISCUSSION: The CR rate in this study was 61. 8%, thus indicating that there is still room for improvement. The combination of dexamethasone and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, or the changeover from granisetron to palonosetron could therefore increase the CR rate.","['Goto, Takashi', 'Tanimoto, Kazuki', 'Ishibashi, Makoto', 'Okamura, Seiichi']","['Goto T', 'Tanimoto K', 'Ishibashi M', 'Okamura S']","['Dept. of Pharmacy, Kyushu Medical Center, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Ninety-one patients diagnosed with SMM at Mayo Clinic from January 1994 through January 2007, who had testing for circulating PCs using an immunofluorescent assay and adequate follow-up to ascertain disease progression, were studied. High level of circulating PCs was defined as absolute peripheral blood PCs >5 x 10(6)/l and/or >5% PCs per 100 cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig)-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with high circulating PCs (14 of 91 patients, 15%) were significantly more likely to progress to active disease within 2 years compared with patients without high circulating PCs, 71% versus 24%, respectively, P=0.001. Corresponding rates for progression within 3 years were 86% versus 34%, respectively, P<0.001. Overall survival (OS) after both SMM diagnosis and MM diagnosis was also significantly different. High levels of circulating PCs identify SMM patients with an elevated risk of progression within the first 2-3 years following diagnosis.","['Bianchi, G', 'Kyle, R A', 'Larson, D R', 'Witzig, T E', 'Kumar, S', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Morice, W G', 'Rajkumar, S V']","['Bianchi G', 'Kyle RA', 'Larson DR', 'Witzig TE', 'Kumar S', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Morice WG', 'Rajkumar SV']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120820,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012237 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.237 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):680-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.237.

Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (ZLD) reduce skeletal events in MM and the immunomodulatory agent thalidomide (Thal) has proven effectiveness in active MM. We hypothesized that treatment with Thal and ZLD would prolong the time to progression (TTP) to MM over ZLD alone. Eligible patients had asymptomatic MM and all patients received ZLD 4 mg intravenous monthly; the treatment arm also received Thal 200 mg per day. The TTP was superior for Thal/ZLD (n=35) patients compared with ZLD alone (n=33); median TTP of 2.4 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-3.6) versus 1.2 years (95% CI: 0.7-2.5) (hazard ratio (HR), 2.05; 95% CI: 1.1-3.8; P-value: 0.02). At 1 year, 86% of Thal/ZLD patients were progression free compared with 55% on ZLD alone (P=0.0048). The overall response rate after year 1 was 37% for Thal/ZLD with a median duration of response of 3.3 years (95% CI: 1.1-NA); there were no confirmed responses to ZLD alone (P=0.0004). The addition of Thal to standard ZLD produces anti-tumor responses whereas ZLD alone does not. Thal/ZLD also prolongs TTP from AMM to MM.

In a series of 86 AML patients, we show that both the full length and/or the short form (sf) of RON are expressed in 51% and 43% of cases, respectively. Interestingly, sfRON is not expressed in normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells and induces part of its oncogenic signaling through interaction with the Src kinase Lyn. sfRON-mediated signaling in leukemic cells also involves mTORC1, the proapoptotic bcl2-family member, BAD, but not the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Furthermore, the expression of sfRON was specifically downregulated by 5-azacytidine (AZA). Conversely, AZA could induce the expression of sfRON in sfRON-negative leukemic cells suggesting that the activity of this drug in AML and myelodysplastic syndromes could involve modulation of TKs. cMET/RON inhibitors exhibited an antileukemic activity exclusively in AML samples and cell lines expressing sfRON.

The response to induction chemotherapy is heterogeneous, therefore biomarkers that predict for the outcome of such treatment are of potential value. FCHSD2 in a sensitized screen was identified as a potential chemo-protector (TW Mak, unpublished). In the present study, we found that FCHSD2 knockdown by shRNA could enhance chemosensitivity of U937 cells. This coincided with the increased expression of p21 and PUMA as well as the decreased expression of Bcl-2, c-myc and hTERT. In contrast, over-expression of FCHSD2 significantly increased cellular chemoresistance. To see if there was potential clinical relevance of FCHSD2 expression in leukemia we used qRT-PCR to assess FCHSD2 expression levels in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts of 71 AML patients. There was an inverse correlation between the level of FCHSD2 with overall survival time (r=-0.7647, p<0.0001) and relapse free time (r=-0.8165, p<0.0001). By dividing patients into high and low expression groups using a FCHSD2 expression threshold value of 0.001, the median survival of the high expression group (72 days) was shorter than in the low expression group (2472 days). The average FCHSD2 expression level in 41 patients with complete remission was significantly lower than that in 30 non-responder patients (p<0.0001). Moreover, in 32 de novo AML patients receiving initial remission-induction chemotherapy, we confirmed that the patients with lower FCHSD2 expression prior to the treatment had an increased chance of attaining remission compared to patients with high level FCHSD2. In conclusion, our study, for the first time, demonstrates FCHSD2 as a predictor of outcome for AML patient. The determination of FCHSD2 expression at the time of diagnosis could help to identify the responses of AML patients to chemotherapy.","['Han, Youqi', 'Cui, Jie', 'Lu, Yan', 'Sue, Stephanie', 'Arpaia, Enrico', 'Mak, Tak W', 'Minden, Mark D']","['Han Y', 'Cui J', 'Lu Y', 'Sue S', 'Arpaia E', 'Mak TW', 'Minden MD']","['Division of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FCHSD2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/08/21 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00278-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.06.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Nov;36(11):1339-46. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.06.011.

We investigated whether transcription factor GATA1 plays a role in transmitting hematopoietic gene expression programs through mitosis when transcription is transiently silenced. Live-cell imaging revealed that a fraction of GATA1 is retained focally within mitotic chromatin. ChIP-seq of highly purified mitotic cells uncovered that key hematopoietic regulatory genes are occupied by GATA1 in mitosis. The GATA1 coregulators FOG1 and TAL1 dissociate from mitotic chromatin, suggesting that GATA1 functions as platform for their postmitotic recruitment. Mitotic GATA1 target genes tend to reactivate more rapidly upon entry into G1 than genes from which GATA1 dissociates. Mitosis-specific destruction of GATA1 delays reactivation selectively of genes that retain GATA1 during mitosis. These studies suggest a requirement of mitotic ""bookmarking"" by GATA1 for the faithful propagation of cell-type-specific transcription programs through cell division.","['Kadauke, Stephan', 'Udugama, Maheshi I', 'Pawlicki, Jan M', 'Achtman, Jordan C', 'Jain, Deepti P', 'Cheng, Yong', 'Hardison, Ross C', 'Blobel, Gerd A']","['Kadauke S', 'Udugama MI', 'Pawlicki JM', 'Achtman JC', 'Jain DP', 'Cheng Y', 'Hardison RC', 'Blobel GA']","[""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpm1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Histone Code', 'Mice', '*Mitosis', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2012/08/21 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(12)00881-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2012 Aug 17;150(4):725-37. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.038.,PMC3425057,"['DK065806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK058044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK058044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK065806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054937/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK054937/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 HG005573/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK065806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HG005573/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NIHMS396607'],['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Incidence increases with age and more diagnoses are expected with the aging population. Treatment includes red blood cell transfusion for anemia. The immunomodulatory agents (imids) thalidomide and lenalidomide may induce transfusion independence. This guideline systematically reviews evidence on imids to treat MDS and makes evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: The literature and meeting abstracts were searched for phase 2-3 clinical trials. Data on efficacy, toxicity, and which patients benefit were extracted. RESULTS: 7019 citations on MDS management were identified. Thirteen publications and 9 meeting abstracts met eligibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide is recommended as first line therapy in lower risk del5q MDS. There is insufficient evidence to recommend lenalidomide for treatment of higher risk del5q MDS or AML, or for any risk non-del5q MDS or AML. Combining lenalidomide with other agents is not recommended. Thalidomide is not recommended.","['Leitch, Heather A', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Shamy, April', 'Storring, John M']","['Leitch HA', 'Buckstein R', 'Shamy A', 'Storring JM']","[""Hematology, St. Paul's Hospital and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. hleitch@providencehematology.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120815,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotype', 'Lenalidomide', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(12)00139-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2012.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2013 Feb;85(2):162-92. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2012.07.003.

However, treatments are associated with symptomatic osteonecrosis that disproportionately affects adolescents. Based on the findings from the CCG-1882 trial, the CCG-1961 trial was designed to assess whether dexamethasone dose modification would reduce the risk of osteonecrosis. We therefore compared use of continuous versus alternate-week dexamethasone within standard and intensified post-induction treatments. METHODS: In the CCG-1961 trial, a multicohort cooperative group trial, 2056 patients (aged 1-21 years) with newly diagnosed high-risk ALL (age >/=10 years, white blood cell count >/=50x10(9) per L, or both) were recruited. To address osteonecrosis, a novel alternate-week schedule of dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2) per day on days 0-6 and 14-20) was compared with standard continuous dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2) per day on days 0-20) in computer-generated randomised regimens with permuted blocks within double or single delayed intensification phases, respectively. Masking was not possible because of the differences in the treatments. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002812. FINDINGS: Symptomatic osteonecrosis was diagnosed in 143 patients at 377 confirmed skeletal sites, resulting in 139 surgeries. In patients aged 1-21 years, the overall cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis at 5 years was 7.7% (SE 0.9), correlating with age at ALL diagnosis (1-9 years, 1.0% [0.5]; 10-15 years, 9.9% [1.5], hazard ratio 10.4 [4.8-22.5]; 16-21 years, 20.0% [4.3], 22.2 [10.0-49.3]; p<0.0001) and sex of the patients aged 10-21 years (girls 15.7% [2.5] vs boys 9.3% [1.7], 1.7 [1.2-2.4]; p=0.001). For patients aged 10 years and older with a rapid response to induction treatment, the use of alternate-week dexamethasone during phases of delayed intensification significantly reduced osteonecrosis incidence compared with continuous dexamethasone (8.7% [2.1] vs 17.0% [2.9], 2.1 [1.4-3.1]; p=0.0005), especially in those aged 16 years and older (11.3% [5.3] vs 37.5% [11.0], p=0.0003; girls 17.2% [8.1] vs 43.9% [14.1], p=0.05; boys 7.7% [5.9] vs 34.6% [11.6], p=0.0014). INTERPRETATION: Alternate-week dexamethasone during delayed intensification phases, a simple dose modification, reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in children and adolescents given intensified treatment for high-risk ALL. Its use is being evaluated in children with standard risk ALL.

It results in juxtaposition of the 5' part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3' part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9. Since the majority of CML cases are currently treated with Imatinib, variant rearrangements in general have no specific prognostic significance, although the mechanisms involved in resistance to therapy have yet to be investigated. The T315I mutation within the abl-gene is the most frequent one associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RESULTS: This study evaluated a Ph chromosome positive CML case resistant to imatinib mesylate. A dic(17;18), loss of TP53 gene, co-expression of b2a2 and b3a2 fusions transcript and a T315I mutation were found. CONCLUSIONS: We reported here a novel case of a Ph chromosome positive CML with a secondary abnormality [dic(17;18)], resulting to Glivec resistance but good response to nilotinib. The dic(17;18) might be a marker for poor prognosis in CML. Our finding indicated for an aggressive progression of the disease. The patient died under the treatment due to unknown reasons.","['Al-Achkar, Walid', 'Wafa, Abdulsamad', 'Moassass, Faten', 'Othman, Moneeb Abdullah Kassem']","['Al-Achkar W', 'Wafa A', 'Moassass F', 'Othman MA']","['Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Department, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria. ascientific@aec.org.sy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120820,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,2012/08/21 06:00,2012/08/21 06:01,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-5-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-5-36 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2012 Aug 20;5(1):36. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-5-36.,PMC3462673,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the adult, Cdx1 and Cdx2, but not Cdx4, have been intensively explored for their function in intestinal tissue homeostasis and the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal cancers. Involvement in embryonic hematopoiesis was first demonstrated in zebrafish, where cdx genes render posterior lateral plate mesoderm competent to respond to genes specifying hematopoietic fate, and compound mutations in cdx genes thus result in a bloodless phenotype. Parallel studies performed in zebrafish embryos and murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) delineate conserved pathways between fish and mammals, corroborating a BMP/Wnt-Cdx-Hox axis during blood development that can be employed to augment derivation of blood progenitors from pluripotent stem cells in vitro. The molecular regulation of Cdx genes appears complex, as more recent data suggest involvement of non-Hox-related mechanisms and the existence of auto- and cross-regulatory loops governed by morphogens.

METHODS: The expression levels of miR-370 and FoxM1 were assessed in 48 newly diagnosed AML patients, 40 AML patients in 1st complete remission (CR) and 21 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blots, colony formation assay, and beta-Galactosidase ( SA-beta-Gal) staining were used to characterize the changes induced by overexpression or inhibition of miR-370 or FoxM1. RESULTS: We found that the down-regulation of miR-370 expression was a frequent event in both leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells from patients with de novo AML. Lower levels of miR-370 expression were found in 37 of 48 leukemic samples from AML patients compared to those in bone marrow cells derived from healthy adult individuals. Ectopic expression of miR-370 in HL60 and K562 cells led to cell growth arrest and senescence. In contrast, depletion of miR-370 expression using RNA interference enhanced the proliferation of those leukemic cells. Mechanistically, miR-370 targets the transcription factor FoxM1, a well established oncogenic factor promoting cell cycle progression. Moreover, when HL60 and K562 cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, miR-370 expression was up-regulated, which indicates epigenetic silencing of miR-370 in leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, miR-370 may function as a tumor suppressor by targeting FoxM1, and the epigenetic silence of miR-370 thus leads to derepression of FoxM1 expression and consequently contributes to AML development and progression.","['Zhang, Xiaolu', 'Zeng, Jiping', 'Zhou, Minran', 'Li, Bingnan', 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Huang, Tao', 'Wang, Lixiang', 'Jia, Jihui', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Zhang X', 'Zeng J', 'Zhou M', 'Li B', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang T', 'Wang L', 'Jia J', 'Chen C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No,107, Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, P, R, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120817,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN370 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-11-56 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-11-56 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2012 Aug 17;11:56. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-11-56.,PMC3533721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the potential of a particular class of mass spectrometry-based quantitation approaches, label-free alignment of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data sets, for the identification of biomarkers for acute leukemias, we asked whether a label-free alignment algorithm could distinguish known classes of leukemias on the basis of their proteomes. This approach to quantitation involves (1) computational alignment of MS1 peptide peaks across large numbers of samples; (2) measurement of the relative abundance of peptides across samples by integrating the area under the curve of the MS1 peaks; and (3) assignment of peptide IDs to those quantified peptide peaks on the basis of the corresponding MS2 spectra. We extracted proteins from blasts derived from four patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, acute leukemia of myeloid lineage) and five patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL, acute leukemia of lymphoid lineage). Mobilized CD34+ cells purified from peripheral blood of six healthy donors and mononuclear cells (MNC) from the peripheral blood of two healthy donors were used as healthy controls. Proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and quantified with a label-free alignment-based algorithm developed in our laboratory. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of blinded samples separated the samples according to their known biological characteristics, with each sample group forming a discrete cluster. The four proteins best able to distinguish CD34+, AML, and ALL were all either known biomarkers or proteins whose biological functions are consistent with their ability to distinguish these classes. We conclude that alignment-based label-free quantitation of LC-MS/MS data sets can, at least in some cases, robustly distinguish known classes of leukemias, thus opening the possibility that large scale studies using such algorithms can lead to the identification of clinically useful biomarkers.","['Foss, Eric J', 'Radulovic, Dragan', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Sala-Torra, Olga', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan, Era L', 'Hengel, Shawna M', 'Loeb, Keith R', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Goodlett, David R', 'Bedalov, Antonio']","['Foss EJ', 'Radulovic D', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Radich J', 'Sala-Torra O', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan EL', 'Hengel SM', 'Loeb KR', 'Deeg HJ', 'Meshinchi S', 'Goodlett DR', 'Bedalov A']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/classification', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/classification', 'Proteomics', '*Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr300567r [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2012 Oct 5;11(10):5005-10. doi: 10.1021/pr300567r.

This dual nature has been exploited by leukemia cells to promote growth, survival, and genomic instability-some of the hallmarks of the cancer phenotype. In addition to altered ROS levels, many antioxidants are dysregulated in leukemia cells. Together, the production of ROS and the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes make up the primary redox control of leukemia cells. By manipulating this system, leukemia cells gain proliferative and survival advantages, even in the face of therapeutic insults. Standard treatment options have improved leukemia patient survival rates in recent years, although relapse and the development of resistance are persistent challenges. Therapies targeting the redox environment show promise for these cases. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms that control the redox milieu of leukemia cells. In particular, ROS production by the mitochondrial electron transport chain, NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase, and cytochrome P450 will be addressed. Expression and activation of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, heme oxygenase, glutathione, thioredoxin, and peroxiredoxin are perturbed in leukemia cells, and the functional consequences of these molecular alterations will be described. Lastly, we delve into how these pathways can be potentially exploited therapeutically to improve treatment regimens and promote better outcomes for leukemia patients.","['Irwin, Mary E', 'Rivera-Del Valle, Nilsa', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Irwin ME', 'Rivera-Del Valle N', 'Chandra J']","[""Department of Pediatrics Research, Children's Cancer Hospital, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20120928,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2012/08/21 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2012/08/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2011.4258 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2013 Apr 10;18(11):1349-83. doi: 10.1089/ars.2011.4258.

Itk plays an important role in normal T-cell functions and in the pathophysiology of both autoimmune diseases and T-cell malignancies. Here, we describe the initial characterization of a selective inhibitor, 7-benzyl-1-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl)-2-(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-g ]quinoxalin-6(5H)-one (CTA056), that was developed through screening a 9600-compound combinatorial solution phase library, followed by molecular modeling, and extensive structure-activity relationship studies. CTA056 exhibits the highest inhibitory effects toward Itk, followed by Btk and endothelial and epithelial tyrosine kinase. Among the 41 cancer cell lines analyzed, CTA056 selectively targets acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Normal T cells are minimally affected. Incubation of Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells with CTA056 resulted in the inhibition of the phosphorylation of Itk and its effectors including PLC-gamma, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as the decreased secretion of targeted genes such as interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. Jurkat cells also underwent apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner when incubated with CTA056. The potent apoptosis-inducing potential of CTA056 is reflected by the significant modulation of microRNAs involved in survival pathways and oncogenesis. The in vitro cytotoxic effect on malignant T cells is further validated in a xenograft model. The selective expression and activation of Itk in malignant T cells, as well as the specificity of CTA056 for Itk, make this molecule a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.","['Guo, Wenchang', 'Liu, Ruiwu', 'Ono, Yoko', 'Ma, Ai-Hong', 'Martinez, Anthony', 'Sanchez, Eduardo', 'Wang, Yan', 'Huang, Wenzhe', 'Mazloom, Anisha', 'Li, Jixian', 'Ning, Jinying', 'Maverakis, Emanual', 'Lam, Kit S', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien']","['Guo W', 'Liu R', 'Ono Y', 'Ma AH', 'Martinez A', 'Sanchez E', 'Wang Y', 'Huang W', 'Mazloom A', 'Li J', 'Ning J', 'Maverakis E', 'Lam KS', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine,,University of California Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0', '(7-benzyl-1-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl)-2-(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-1H-imidazo(4,5-', 'g)quinoxalin-6(5H)-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.079889 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.079889 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2012 Nov;82(5):938-47. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.079889.

The reasons for this down-regulation of T-cell phenotype are still unknown. To elucidate whether epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the loss of the T-cell phenotype, we treated anaplastic large cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines (n=4, each) with epigenetic modifiers to evoke DNA demethylation and histone acetylation. Global gene expression data from treated and untreated cell lines were generated and selected, and differentially expressed genes were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Additionally, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Combined DNA demethylation and histone acetylation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells was not able to reconstitute their T-cell phenotype. Instead, the same treatment induced in T cells: (i) an up-regulation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma-characteristic genes (e.g. ID2, LGALS1, c-JUN), and (ii) an almost complete extinction of their T-cell phenotype including CD3, LCK and ZAP70. In addition, suppressive trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 of important T-cell transcription factor genes (GATA3, LEF1, TCF1) was present in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, which is in line with their absence in primary tumor specimens as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Our data suggest that epigenetically activated suppressors (e.g. ID2) contribute to the down-regulation of the T-cell expression program in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which is maintained by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27.","['Joosten, Maria', 'Seitz, Volkhard', 'Zimmermann, Karin', 'Sommerfeld, Anke', 'Berg, Erika', 'Lenze, Dido', 'Leser, Ulf', 'Stein, Harald', 'Hummel, Michael']","['Joosten M', 'Seitz V', 'Zimmermann K', 'Sommerfeld A', 'Berg E', 'Lenze D', 'Leser U', 'Stein H', 'Hummel M']","['Institute of Pathology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.054619 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.054619 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Feb;98(2):247-54. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.054619.

We assessed the value of CLLU1 expression in the LRF CLL4 randomized trial. Samples from 515 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were collected immediately before the start of treatment. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, CLLU1 expression was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In total, 247 and 268 samples were identified as having low and high CLLU1 expression, respectively. The median follow-up was 88 months. High CLLU1 expression was significantly correlated with unmutated IGHV genes, ZAP-70 and CD38 positivity, and absence of 13q deletion (all r>0.2, P<0.0001). At 6 years, patients with high CLLU1 expression had significantly worse progression-free survival (9% versus 17%; P=0.03) and overall survival (42% versus 57%; P=0.0003) than patients with low CLLU1 expression. Among patients with mutated IGHV genes, overall survival at 6 years was 50% in those with high CLLU1 expression and 76% in those with low CLLU1 expression (P=0.005). However, CLLU1 expression was not an independent predictor of overall survival in a multivariate model including TP53 aberrations, beta-2 microglobulin level, age and IGHV mutation status. Nor did it predict response to treatment. CLLU1 expression analysis helps to refine the prognosis of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have mutated IGHV genes.","['Gonzalez, David', 'Else, Monica', 'Wren, Dorte', 'Usai, Monica', 'Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Parker, Anton', 'Oscier, David', 'Morgan, Gareth', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Gonzalez D', 'Else M', 'Wren D', 'Usai M', 'Buhl AM', 'Parker A', 'Oscier D', 'Morgan G', 'Catovsky D']","['Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. david.gonzalez-de-castro@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CLLU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.070201 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.070201 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Feb;98(2):274-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.070201.

In high-density cultured cells and in vivo growing cells, whether these cyclins are expressed in the same pattern remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of cyclins by flow cytometry and western-blotting in cultured MOLT-4 and HepG2 cells at high-density. We found that, in high-density cultures, the expression levels of cyclin D, E, and A within each cell cycle phase was less than their levels in low-density cultures. Cyclin B1 was slightly reduced in G2/M phase and unexpectedly expressed in G1 phase. The cyclin B1 expressed in G1 phase was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, and its level was positively correlated with apoptosis. Moreover, we obtained similar cyclins expression pattern in inoculated HepG2 tumor cells from immune-deprived mice and leukemic cells from leukemia patients. These findings describe an altered pattern of cyclin expression in high-density cultured cells as well as in vivo tumor cells. We suggest that high-density cultures might mimic the in vivo growth conditions and such experimental situation may be useful for cell cycle research.","['Min, Jiang', 'Wang, Xiangyang', 'Tong, Yixin', 'Li, Xiaolan', 'Tao, Deding', 'Hu, Junbo', 'Xie, Daxing', 'Gong, Jianping']","['Min J', 'Wang X', 'Tong Y', 'Li X', 'Tao D', 'Hu J', 'Xie D', 'Gong J']","[""Tongji Cancer Research Institute, Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120815,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Revealing the underlying mechanism of ESC characteristics is important for the application of ESCs in clinical medicine. We performed systematic functional screen in mouse ESCs with 4,801 shRNAs that target 929 kinases and phosphatases. One hundred and thirty-two candidate genes that regulate both ESC expansion and stem cell marker expression were identified. Twenty-seven out of the 132 genes were regarded as most important since knockdown of each gene induces morphological changes from undifferentiated to differentiated state. Among the 27 genes, we chose nonmetastatic cell 6 (Nme6, also named as Nm23-H6) and nonmetastatic cell 7 (Nme7, also designated as Nm23-H7) to study first. Nme6 and Nme7 both belong to the members of nucleoside diphosphate kinase family. We demonstrate that Nme6 and Nme7 are important for the regulation of Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-Myc, telomerase, Dnmt3B, Sox2, and ERas expression. Either knockdown of Nme6 or Nme7 reduces the formation of embryoid body (EB) and teratoma. The overexpression of either Nme6 or Nme7 can rescue the stem cell marker expression and the EB formation in the absence of leukemia inhibiting factor. This implies the importance of Nme6 and Nme7 in ESC renewal. This finding not only pinpoints Nme6 or Nme7 can regulate several critical regulators in ESC renewal but also increases our understanding of the ESC renewal and oncogenesis.","['Wang, Chia-Hui', 'Ma, Nianhan', 'Lin, Yu-Tsen', 'Wu, Cheng-Chung', 'Hsiao, Michael', 'Lu, Frank Leigh', 'Yu, Ching-Chia', 'Chen, Shao-Yin', 'Lu, Jean']","['Wang CH', 'Ma N', 'Lin YT', 'Wu CC', 'Hsiao M', 'Lu FL', 'Yu CC', 'Chen SY', 'Lu J']","['Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1203 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Oct;30(10):2199-211. doi: 10.1002/stem.1203.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,

However, the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that LIF significantly enhanced in vitro survival and promoted differentiation of human ESC-derived NP cells. In NP cells, as well as NP-derived neurons, LIF reduced caspase-mediated apoptosis and reduced both spontaneous and H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species in culture. In vitro, NP cell proliferation and the yield of differentiated neurons were significantly higher in the presence of LIF. In NP cells, LIF enhanced cMyc phosphorylation, commonly associated with self-renewal/proliferation. Also, in differentiating NP cells LIF activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways, associated with cell survival and reduced apoptosis. When differentiated in LIF+ media, neurite outgrowth and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were potentiated together with increased expression of gp130, a component of the LIF receptor complex. NP cells, pretreated in vitro with LIF, were effective in reducing infarct volume in a model of focal ischemic stroke but LIF did not lead to significantly improved initial NP cell survival over nontreated NP cells. Our results show that LIF signaling significantly promotes human NP cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation in vitro. Activated LIF signaling should be considered in cell culture expansion systems for future human NP cell-based therapeutic transplant studies.","['Majumder, Anirban', 'Banerjee, Saswati', 'Harrill, Joshua A', 'Machacek, David W', 'Mohamad, Osama', 'Bacanamwo, Methode', 'Mundy, William R', 'Wei, Ling', 'Dhara, Sujoy K', 'Stice, Steven L']","['Majumder A', 'Banerjee S', 'Harrill JA', 'Machacek DW', 'Mohamad O', 'Bacanamwo M', 'Mundy WR', 'Wei L', 'Dhara SK', 'Stice SL']","['Regenerative Bioscience Center, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Growth Factors/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology/transplantation', 'Neurites/metabolism/physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1201 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Nov;30(11):2387-99. doi: 10.1002/stem.1201.,,"['NS058710/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS062097/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,

Here we show that heterozygous expression of the IDH1(R132H) allele is sufficient to induce the genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation characteristic of these tumors. Using a gene-targeting approach, we knocked-in a single copy of the most frequently observed IDH1 mutation, R132H, into a human cancer cell line and profiled changes in DNA methylation at over 27,000 CpG dinucleotides relative to wild-type parental cells. We find that IDH1(R132H/WT) mutation induces widespread alterations in DNA methylation, including hypermethylation of 2010 and hypomethylation of 842 CpG loci. We demonstrate that many of these alterations are consistent with those observed in IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ primary gliomas and can segregate IDH wild-type and mutated tumors as well as those exhibiting the G-CIMP phenotype in unsupervised analysis of two primary glioma cohorts. Further, we show that the direction of IDH1(R132H/WT)-mediated DNA methylation change is largely dependent upon preexisting DNA methylation levels, resulting in depletion of moderately methylated loci. Additionally, whereas the levels of multiple histone H3 and H4 methylation modifications were globally increased, consistent with broad inhibition of histone demethylation, hypermethylation at H3K9 in particular accompanied locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at several genes down-regulated in IDH1(R132H/WT) knock-in cells. These data provide insight on epigenetic alterations induced by IDH1 mutations and support a causal role for IDH1(R132H/WT) mutants in driving epigenetic instability in human cancer cells.","['Duncan, Christopher G', 'Barwick, Benjamin G', 'Jin, Genglin', 'Rago, Carlo', 'Kapoor-Vazirani, Priya', 'Powell, Doris R', 'Chi, Jen-Tsan', 'Bigner, Darell D', 'Vertino, Paula M', 'Yan, Hai']","['Duncan CG', 'Barwick BG', 'Jin G', 'Rago C', 'Kapoor-Vazirani P', 'Powell DR', 'Chi JT', 'Bigner DD', 'Vertino PM', 'Yan H']","['The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation Institute, The Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Histones)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Homoharringtonine (HHT), a valid drug for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, has shown some effect on leukemic stem cells. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of HHT on patients with high-risk PV and ET. METHODS: Patients with high-risk PV (n = 17) or ET (n = 18) who had failed or were intolerant to hydroxycarbamide or interferon-alpha therapy received HHT at a dose of 1.5 mg/m(2) daily by continuous infusion for 7 days every month. Hematological responses were evaluated at the 6th month after HHT therapy. RESULTS: After six courses of HHT therapy, the hematological response rates were 64.7 % (11/17) in PV and 72.2% (13/18) in ET. In PV, the single sign remission rates of constitutional symptoms, symptomatic splenomegaly, pruritus and bone pain were 70.0% (7/10), 77.8% (7/9), 50% (1/2) and 100% (3/3), respectively. The remission rates of constitutional symptoms and symptomatic splenomegaly in ET were 66.7% (6/9) and 71.4% (5/7), respectively. The rates of grade 1 granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were 1.8 and 0.9%, respectively. No grade 2 or over events, or pancytopenia were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose HHT alone has considerable short-term efficacy for high-risk PV/ET and may used as a second-line drug for PV/ET treatment in patients who have failed or were intolerant to hydroxycarbamide or interferon-alpha therapy.","['Li, Yufeng', 'Zhu, Jiabin', 'Ding, Banghe']","['Li Y', 'Zhu J', 'Ding B']","['Department of Hematology, No. 1 Hospital of Huaian Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China, liyufeng99@netease.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120817,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cephalotaxus/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/pathology']",2012/08/18 06:00,2014/05/14 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10147-012-0453-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2013 Oct;18(5):922-6. doi: 10.1007/s10147-012-0453-1.

Analysis of imatinib-treated K562 cells reveals a cell population with cell cycle arrest, p27 increase and senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) staining. Preventing apoptosis by caspase inhibition decreases annexin V-positive cells, caspase-3 cleavage and increases the SA-beta-Gal-positive cell population. In addition, a concomitant increase of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 is detected emphasizing the senescent phenotype. Inhibition of apoptosis by targeting Bim expression or overexpression of Bcl2 potentiates senescence. The inhibition of autophagy by silencing the expression of the proteins ATG7 or Beclin-1 prevents the increase of SA-beta-Gal staining in response to imatinib plus Z-Vad. In contrast, in apoptotic-deficient cells (Bim expression or overexpression of Bcl2), the inhibition of autophagy did not significantly modify the SA-beta-Gal-positive cell population. Surprisingly, targeting autophagy by inhibiting ATG5 is accompanied by a strong SA-beta-Gal staining, suggesting a specific inhibitory role on senescence. These results demonstrate that in addition to apoptosis and autophagy, imatinib induced senescence in K562 CML cells. Moreover, apoptosis is limiting the senescent response to imatinib, whereas autophagy seems to have an opposite role.","['Drullion, C', 'Tregoat, C', 'Lagarde, V', 'Tan, S', 'Gioia, R', 'Priault, M', 'Djavaheri-Mergny, M', 'Brisson, A', 'Auberger, P', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Pasquet, J-M']","['Drullion C', 'Tregoat C', 'Lagarde V', 'Tan S', 'Gioia R', 'Priault M', 'Djavaheri-Mergny M', 'Brisson A', 'Auberger P', 'Mahon FX', 'Pasquet JM']","['Laboratoire hematopoiese leucemique et cibles therapeutiques, INSERM U1035, Universite Bordeaux Segalen, 33076 Bordeaux, cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartic acid)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Beclin-1', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/18 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012111 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.111 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Aug 16;3:e373. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.111.,PMC3434662,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, GC therapy is not effective in all patients. The molecular mechanisms responsible for GC-induced apoptosis and resistance were therefore investigated in primary malignant cells obtained from a cohort of 46 patients with CLL. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis was unaffected by p53 dysfunction and more pronounced in cases with unmutated IGHV genes. Cross-resistance was observed between dexamethasone and other GCs but not fludarabine, indicating non-identical resistance mechanisms. GC treatment resulted in the upregulation of Bim mRNA and protein, but to comparable levels in both GC-resistant and sensitive cells. Pre-incubation with Bim siRNAs reduced GC-induced upregulation of Bim protein and conferred resistance to GC-induced apoptosis in previously GC-sensitive cells. GC-induced upregulation of Bim was associated with the activation of Bax and Bak in GC-sensitive but not -resistant CLL samples. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Bim does not interact directly with Bax or Bak, but is almost exclusively bound to Bcl-2 regardless of GC treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the GC-induced killing of CLL cells results from the indirect activation of Bax and Bak by upregulated Bim/Bcl-2 complexes, and that GC resistance results from the failure of such activation to occur.","['Melarangi, T', 'Zhuang, J', 'Lin, K', 'Rockliffe, N', 'Bosanquet, A G', 'Oates, M', 'Slupsky, J R', 'Pettitt, A R']","['Melarangi T', 'Zhuang J', 'Lin K', 'Rockliffe N', 'Bosanquet AG', 'Oates M', 'Slupsky JR', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2012/08/18 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012102 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.102 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Aug 16;3:e372. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.102.,PMC3434667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many human tumors including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are partially or completely resistant to monotherapy with TRAIL, limiting its therapeutic utility. Therefore, identification of factors that contribute to TRAIL resistance may facilitate future development of more effective TRAIL-based cancer therapies. Here, we report a previously unknown role for WT1 in mediating TRAIL resistance in leukemia. Knockdown of WT1 with shRNA rendered TRAIL-resistant myeloid leukemia cells sensitive to TRAIL-induced cell death, and re-expression of shRNA-resistant WT1 restored TRAIL resistance. Notably, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in WT1-silenced cells was largely due to down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Moreover, WT1 expression strongly correlated with overexpression of Bcl-xL in AML cell lines and blasts from AML patients. Furthermore, we found that WT1 transactivates Bcl-xL by directly binding to its promoter. We previously showed that WT1 is a novel client protein of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in reduced WT1 and Bcl-xL expression leading to increased sensitivity of leukemia cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Time trends might conceal underlying steps caused by changes in diagnosis and registration procedures. METHODS: Using records from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours 1966-2005 (N=54650), the age-sex-standardised rate for residents of Great Britain aged under 15 years was calculated by individual year of diagnosis for each cancer subtype, and the average annual percentage change (trend) was assessed. The timing of assumed step changes in rate was estimated by iterative Poisson regression, and compared graphically with the approximate timing of innovations previously identified from published sources. RESULTS: Estimated timing of underlying steps approximately coincided with the following relevant innovations: biochemical assays, mid-1980s (hepatic and germ-cell cancer); diagnostic imaging, mid-1980s to early 1990s (intracranial/intraspinal tumours, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma); revised cancer registration scheme, 1971 (leukaemia, bone and soft-tissue sarcoma); mandatory registration, 1993 (intracranial/intraspinal tumours, retinoblastoma, melanoma/carcinoma); cancer registration improvements, 2001 (leukaemia, renal and hepatic cancer). CONCLUSION: While the possibility of some real change in risk cannot be excluded, for many cancer subtypes the estimated timing of underlying step changes in rate appeared to correspond with changes in diagnosis or registration procedures. Childhood cancer may have been considerably under-recorded in the past.","['Kroll, M E', 'Carpenter, L M', 'Murphy, M F G', 'Stiller, C A']","['Kroll ME', 'Carpenter LM', 'Murphy MF', 'Stiller CA']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LG, UK. mary.kroll@ceu.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', '*Registries', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012296 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.296 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Sep 25;107(7):1159-62. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.296.

This study assesses the safety and efficacy of oral imatinib in association with a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster intensive chemotherapy regimen and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for paediatric patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. METHODS: Patients aged 1-18 years recruited to national trials of front-line treatment for ALL were eligible if they had t(9;22)(q34;q11). Patients with abnormal renal or hepatic function, or an active systemic infection, were ineligible. Patients were enrolled by ten study groups between 2004 and 2009, and were classified as good risk or poor risk according to early response to induction treatment. Good-risk patients were randomly assigned by a web-based system with permuted blocks (size four) to receive post-induction imatinib with chemotherapy or chemotherapy only in a 1:1 ratio, while all poor-risk patients received post-induction imatinib with chemotherapy. Patients were stratified by study group. The chemotherapy regimen was modelled on a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster high-risk backbone; all received four post-induction blocks of chemotherapy after which they became eligible for stem-cell transplantation. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival at 4 years in the good-risk group and event-free survival at 4 years in the poor-risk group, analysed by intention to treat and a secondary analysis of patients as treated. The trial is registered with EudraCT (2004-001647-30) and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00287105. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2009, we screened 229 patients and enrolled 178: 108 were good risk and 70 poor risk. 46 good-risk patients were assigned to receive imatinib and 44 to receive no imatinib. Median follow-up was 3.1 years (IQR 2.0-4.6). 4-year disease-free survival was 72.9% (95% CI 56.1-84.1) in the good-risk, imatinib group versus 61.7% (45.0-74.7) in the good-risk, no imatinib group (p=0.24). The hazard ratio (HR) for failure, adjusted for minimal residual disease, was 0.63 (0.28-1.41; p=0.26). The as-treated analysis showed 4-year disease-free survival was 75.2% (61.0-84.9) for good-risk patients receiving imatinib and 55.9% (36.1-71.7) for those who did not receive imatinib (p=0.06). 4-year event-free survival for poor-risk patients was 53.5% (40.4-65.0). Serious adverse events were much the same in the good-risk groups, with infections caused by myelosuppression the most common. 16 patients in the good-risk imatinib group versus ten in the good-risk, no imatinib group (p=0.64), and 24 in the poor-risk group, had a serious adverse event. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggests that imatinib in conjunction with intensive chemotherapy is well tolerated and might be beneficial for treatment of children with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL.

Our studies demonstrate that inhibitors of autophagy or cathepsin B activity and/or molecular targeting of p62/SQSTM1, Atg7, or cathepsin B result in partial reversal of the suppressive effects of AS(2)O(3) on BCR-ABL expressing leukemic progenitors, including primitive leukemic precursors from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. Altogether, these findings indicate that autophagic degradation of BCR-ABL is critical for the induction of the antileukemic effects of As(2)O(3) and raise the potential for future therapeutic approaches to target BCR-ABL expressing cells by modulating elements of the autophagic machinery to promote BCR-ABL degradation.","['Goussetis, Dennis J', 'Gounaris, Elias', 'Wu, Edward J', 'Vakana, Eliza', 'Sharma, Bhumika', 'Bogyo, Matthew', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Goussetis DJ', 'Gounaris E', 'Wu EJ', 'Vakana E', 'Sharma B', 'Bogyo M', 'Altman JK', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Here we studied the in vitro megakaryopoiesis of 3 FPD/AML pedigrees. A 60% to 80% decrease in the output of megakaryocytes (MKs) from CD34(+) was observed. MK ploidy level was low and mature MKs displayed a major defect in proplatelet formation. To explain these defects, we focused on myosin II expression as RUNX1 has been shown to regulate MYL9 and MYH10 in an inverse way. In FPD/AML MKs, expression of MYL9 and MYH9 was decreased, whereas MYH10 expression was increased and the MYH10 protein was still present in the cytoplasm of mature MKs. Myosin II activity inhibition by blebbistatin rescued the ploidy defect of FPD/AML MKs. Finally, we demonstrate that MYH9 is a direct target of RUNX1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays and we identified new RUNX1 binding sites in the MYL9 promoter region. Together, these results demonstrate that the defects in megakaryopoiesis observed in FPD/AML are, in part, related to a deregulation of myosin IIA and IIB expression leading to both a defect in ploidization and proplatelet formation.","['Bluteau, Dominique', 'Glembotsky, Ana C', 'Raimbault, Anna', 'Balayn, Nathalie', 'Gilles, Laure', 'Rameau, Philippe', 'Nurden, Paquita', 'Alessi, Marie Christine', 'Debili, Najet', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Heller, Paula G', 'Favier, Remi', 'Raslova, Hana']","['Bluteau D', 'Glembotsky AC', 'Raimbault A', 'Balayn N', 'Gilles L', 'Rameau P', 'Nurden P', 'Alessi MC', 'Debili N', 'Vainchenker W', 'Heller PG', 'Favier R', 'Raslova H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '20WC4J7CQ6 (blebbistatin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB)']",IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46376-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-422337 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Sep 27;120(13):2708-18. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-422337.

Our results show that PTK7 expression in normal thymic T cells is tightly regulated during the maturational process, but in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) the expected temporal relationship of expression between PTK7 and other maturational T cell markers is lost or disrupted. In addition, nearly all T-ALL cases expressed higher PTK7 levels than mature T cells in the human bone marrow specimens.

In this trial, we treated 50 consecutive patients with refractory or relapsed lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patients included were considered to have poor-prognosis disease (eg, one-third was chemo-refractory at transplantation and more than one-half had failed previous autologous or allogeneic SCT). All patients engrafted and achieved full donor chimerism. Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) occurred in 64% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 79%), and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in 51% (95% CI, 36% to 66%). At 3 years, overall survival was 61% (95% CI, 46% to 75%). Progression-free survival was 55% (95% CI, 40% to 70%), with 30% (95% CI, 19% to 47%) transplantation-related mortality and a relapse incidence of 15% (95% CI, 7% to 32%). Disease classification and stage as well as remission status at transplantation and type of previous treatment (including previous SCT) had no significant impact on transplantation outcome. In conclusion, allogeneic SCT after BEAM/fludarabine/TBI provides excellent tumor control with complete and durable remissions in patients with poor-prognosis lymphoma and CLL. High rates of GVHD and GVHD-related mortality associated with this regimen are a major concern and warrant modification of the regimen in the future.","[""O'Meara, Alix"", 'Halter, Jorg', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Gerull, Sabine', 'Bucher, Christoph', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Buser, Andreas', 'Stern, Martin']","[""O'Meara A"", 'Halter J', 'Heim D', 'Gerull S', 'Bucher C', 'Passweg J', 'Buser A', 'Stern M']","['Stem Cell Transplant Team, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. omearaa@uhbs.ch']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20120813,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'BEAM protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/prevention & control', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Podophyllotoxin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00320-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jan;19(1):82-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.08.008.

METHODS: Ten patients in various phases of CML, not responding to imatinib and started on dasatinib, were included and analyzed. The baseline characteristics of the patients and their salient features including the duration and response to initial therapy as well as to dasatinib, were noted. RESULTS: Before starting dasatinib three patients were in chronic phase of CML while seven others were in the progressive phase (accelerated and blast phase) of CML. Half the patients developed transient grade 3 and 4 toxicities to dasatinib. Overall, the tolerability of the drug in all 10 patients was acceptable and none discontinued treatment. Three patients died due to progressive disease while the remaining seven are continuing the drug with the disease still under cytogenetic or hematological remission. Of the 10 patients, seven achieved complete hematological response and two of the accelerated phase/blast crisis patients achieved complete cytogenetic response. Overall, dasatinib was able to control disease for a median of 20.6 months. CONCLUSION: Despite small sample size and insufficient information on mutational analysis, dasatinib is effective in CML in India. Cost limits the use of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors in India. Our observation is not suitable for survival analysis but the difference made by dasatinib in progressive disease and its tolerability needs to be acknowledged.","['Sharma, Atul', 'Bahl, Ankur', 'Raina, Vinod', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Gupta, Ritu']","['Sharma A', 'Bahl A', 'Raina V', 'Kumar L', 'Gupta R']","['Department of Medical Oncology Laboratory Oncology, Dr B.

We demonstrate that ASXL1 associates with the PRC2, and that loss of ASXL1 in vivo collaborates with NRASG12D to promote myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Adli, Mazhar', 'LaFave, Lindsay M', 'Gao, Jie', 'Hricik, Todd', 'Shih, Alan H', 'Pandey, Suveg', 'Patel, Jay P', 'Chung, Young Rock', 'Koche, Richard', 'Perna, Fabiana', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Taylor, Jordan E', 'Park, Christopher Y', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Jaffe, Jacob D', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Abdel-Wahab O', 'Adli M', 'LaFave LM', 'Gao J', 'Hricik T', 'Shih AH', 'Pandey S', 'Patel JP', 'Chung YR', 'Koche R', 'Perna F', 'Zhao X', 'Taylor JE', 'Park CY', 'Carroll M', 'Melnick A', 'Nimer SD', 'Jaffe JD', 'Aifantis I', 'Bernstein BE', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (BAP1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoietic System/metabolism/pathology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2012/08/18 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(12)00303-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2012.06.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2012 Aug 14;22(2):180-93. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2012.06.032.,PMC3422511,"['U54 CA143798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA160647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA169784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA160647-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U01HL100395/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NIHMS392707'],['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Forty-four ALL survivors in first remission were enrolled. Twenty-six also received 12-18 Gy cranial radiotherapy (RT). Patients' body mass indexes (BMIs) at dignosis and during the study were compared. Metabolic syndrome (MS) evaluation was performed in patients, parents, and siblings older than 6 years. Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index of the survivors was also calculated. In survivors with impaired fasting glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. Thyroid functions and IGF-1 and/or IGFBP-3 levels of the survivors who received cranial RT were evaluated. Median age of the survivors was 11.5 years (6-23). At diagnosis, mean BMI percentile was 46.7 (3-95) and mean z-score was -0.09 +/- 1.14; during the study, these values rose to 71.1 +/- 25.6 (3-100) and 0.8 +/- 0.94, respectively (P < .001).

Survivors had significantly higher BMI percentile and BMI z-score compared to their siblings (P = .006 and P = .011, respectively). The study group was small and we could not show a correlation of the patients' obesity with RT, thyroid functions, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels. In three survivors (6.8%), there was MS. Maternal and paternal MS was not found as a risk factor for MS of the survivors (P = .1, P = .5, respectively). The HOMA index revealed insulin resistance (IR) in 12 (27.2%) of the survivors, whereas OGTT revealed abnormal glucose regulation and/or IR in four.

Univariate analysis showed that patients benefited from lymphodepletion before CAR+T-cell infusion and the administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2). Longer-term persistence (>/= 4 weeks) and stronger expansion of CAR+ T-cells in the blood and higher peak serum interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) level (>/= 200 pg/mL) were also related to superior outcome.

We studied 140 bone marrow samples at diagnosis from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated according to the Brazilian Childhood Leukemia Treatment Group (GBTLI) ALL-99 protocol. The expression profiles of the genes listed above were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then related to the clinical and biological prognostic factors. The results showed significant associations (p </= 0.05) between the expression levels of genes GPR56, BLVRB, IGFBP7 and white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis; GATA3, MAN1A1, CD44, MAP3K12, CLEC11A, SHOC2 and CD10 B-lineage ALL; TCFL5 and bone marrow status at day 14; MAP3K12 and TRIM24 and bone marrow status at day 28; and CD69, TCFL5 and TRIM24 genes and ETV6/RUNX1 positive ALL. The up-regulation of SHOC2 was also associated with better 5-year event-free survival (EFS) in univariate and multivariate analysis (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). These findings highlight genes that could be associated with clinical and biological prognostic factors in childhood ALL, suggesting that these genes may characterize and play a role in the treatment outcome of some ALL subsets.","['Silveira, Vanessa S', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Moreno, Daniel A', 'Yunes, Jose Andres', 'Queiroz, Rosane G P', 'Toledo, Silvia C', 'Lee, Maria Lucia M', 'Petrilli, Antonio S', 'Brandalise, Silvia R', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Silveira VS', 'Scrideli CA', 'Moreno DA', 'Yunes JA', 'Queiroz RG', 'Toledo SC', 'Lee ML', 'Petrilli AS', 'Brandalise SR', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. vssilveira@usp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120908,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.710330 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Feb;54(2):310-4. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.710330.

Patients undergoing such treatments and especially those with acute leukemia need prolonged blood component support and are at risk for platelet (PLT) refractoriness. Irradiated and filtered blood, although effective, does not eliminate the risk for refractoriness and consequent fatal hemorrhage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The current report presents a case of an acute myeloid leukemia patient who became alloimmunized to multiple HLA antigens after complicated autologous stem cell transplantation and to whom granulocytes were transfused as part of treatment for overwhelming sepsis. Poor engraftment necessitated prolonged transfusion dependency with rare HLA-compatible donors detected according to the indirect PLT immunofluorescence test. During the proceeding weeks the patient suffered from recurrent severe attacks of gastrointestinal bleeding. When several conservative treatments failed, a fully HLA-matched, bidirectionally ABO-incompatible allogeneic transplantation from a sibling donor was performed. RESULTS: Allogeneic transplantation was uneventful, with stable full donor-derived lymphohematopoietic engraftment. CONCLUSION: Immune PLT refractoriness can appear at later stages of treatment even in severely immunocompromised patients. Granulocyte transfusions could lead to alloimmunization and should therefore be cautiously considered in this patient population.","['Bonstein, Lilach', 'Stemer, Galia', 'Dann, Eldad J', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Fineman, Riva', 'Haddad, Nuhad']","['Bonstein L', 'Stemer G', 'Dann EJ', 'Zuckerman T', 'Fineman R', 'Haddad N']","['Blood Bank, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, and the Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. l_bonstein@rambam.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120815,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/transplantation', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/immunology/*therapy', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Sepsis/etiology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03855.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2013 May;53(5):1019-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03855.x.

Published data of SACT mortality outside clinical trials is limited with no published Australia data. We aim to establish local outcomes at a regional Victorian oncology center to allow comparison with limited international data. METHODS: An audit was undertaken at Ballarat Health Services to analyze all deaths occurring within 30 and 60 days of receiving SACT (cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy) for epithelial malignancies and hematological malignancies (excluding acute leukemia), over a 12-month period. Hormonal therapy was excluded. RESULTS: Between 1 January and 31 December 2008, 378 patients received SACT. In total 13 deaths (3.4%) occurred within 30 days following SACT. Three deaths (23%) were definitely treatment-related - neutropenic sepsis, pneumocystis pneumonia and bowel perforation, respectively. Eight deaths (62%) were definitely unrelated to treatment. Most deaths were due to disease progression (six patients) For two patients (15%), the cause of death was unknown. Most patients were treated with palliative intent. Most patients were receiving first-line treatment (seven patients, 50%). A further five deaths (1.3%) occurred 31-60 days after SACT, four of which were due to disease progression. CONCLUSION: Our local outcome data are comparable to limited current international data. This type of audit reviews local outcomes and identifies factors contributing to mortality in order to improve standards of care. We encourage similar audits to establish national benchmarks of 30-day mortality rate.","['Yoong, Jaclyn', 'Seah, Jo-An', 'Hamilton, Katherine', 'Teo, Lee Na', 'Chong, Geoffrey']","['Yoong J', 'Seah JA', 'Hamilton K', 'Teo LN', 'Chong G']","['Ballarat Base Hospital, Ballarat Health Services, Ballarat, Victoria 3350, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120312,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,,IM,"['Aged', 'Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Victoria/epidemiology']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/08/09 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01498.x [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2012 Dec;8(4):325-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01498.x.

Whether the use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) alone or along with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) improves overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) is still debated. METHODS: A retrospective reivew was conducted of 20 patients diagnosed with APL according to the French - American - British system. After achieving CR and receiving consolidation chemotherapy, nine patients were given maintenance therapy for 1 year (ATRA 45 mg/m(2) /day p.o., mercaptopurine 60 mg/m(2) /day p.o. and ATO 0.15 mg/kg/day x 5 days/week for six cycles in five patients; ATRA 45 mg/m(2) /d p.o. alternating with ATO 0.15 mg/kg/day x 5 days/week in 1 patient; ATRA only in three patients). RESULTS: In all patients the rates of CR, 3-year OS and 5-year OS were 75, 71 and 57%, respectively. For patients treated with ATO maintenance, the rates were 100% for both 5-year OS and 5-year DFS. Four of six patients on ATO maintenance had grade 1 or grade 2 adverse events. Excluding the two patients who died from intracerebral hemorrhage within 4 days after diagnosis, these rates were 85, 82 and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Upfront ATO maintenance therapy for one year is safe and appears to be effective, with the benefits restricted to patients with APL with t(15;17) translocation. Larger studies will be required to confirm this observation.","['Chiang, Yi-Hao', 'Chang, Yi-Fang', 'Hsieh, Ruey-Kuen', 'Lin, Johnson', 'Chen, Caleb Gonshen', 'Lim, Ken-Hong', 'Lin, Huan-Chau', 'Chang, Ming-Chih']","['Chiang YH', 'Chang YF', 'Hsieh RK', 'Lin J', 'Chen CG', 'Lim KH', 'Lin HC', 'Chang MC']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120312,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2012/08/18 06:00,2013/08/09 06:00,['2012/08/18 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01496.x [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2012 Dec;8(4):330-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01496.x.

The photoisomerization was zero order reaction with an apparent velocity of 4x107 M/min under illumination by white fluorescent lamps (1, 200 lx). An equilibrium mixture of the geometrical isomers (all-trans-acitretin 20%, 9-cis-acitretin 15%, 13-cis-acitretin 30%, 9, 13-di-cis-acitretin 15%, and unidentified compounds 20%) was formed at around 30 min. Equilibrium mixtures with similar composition were obtained by photoisomerization reactions starting from other geometrical isomers. Geometrical isomers of acitretin thus formed, showed different effects to induce differentiation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells): activity of all-trans-acitretin (ED50, 3.2 x 10(-6) M), 9-cis-acitretin (ED50, 2.3 x 10(-5)M), 13-cis-acitretin (ED50, 1.1 x 10(-5)M), 9, 13-di-cis-acitretin (ED50, 2.6 x 10(-6)M). 9-cis-Acitretin acted synergistically with all-trans-acitretin, 13-cis-acitretin and 9, 13-di-cis-acitretin on HL-60 cells.

Survival of relapsed patients can be predicted by site of relapse, length of first complete remission, and immunophenotype of relapsed ALL. BM and early relapse (< 30 months from diagnosis), as well as T-ALL, are associated with worse prognosis than isolated extramedullary or late relapse (> 30 months from diagnosis). In addition, persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction or consolidation therapy predicts poor outcome because children with detectable MRD are more likely to relapse than those in molecular remission, even after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We offer hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to any child with high-risk features because these patients are virtually incurable with chemotherapy alone. By contrast, we treat children with first late BM relapse of B-cell precursor ALL and good clearance of MRD with a chemotherapy approach. We use both systemic and local treatment for extramedullary relapse, mainly represented by radiotherapy and, in case of testicular involvement, by orchiectomy.

Results for patients treated in chronic phase are reported here. Patients (n = 62) received a median of 7 (range, 1-41) cycles. Complete hematologic response was achieved in 48 patients (77%; 95% lower confidence limit, 65%); median response duration was 9.1 months. Fourteen patients (23%; 95% lower confidence limit, 13%) achieved major cytogenetic response, including complete cytogenetic response in 10 (16%). Median progression free-survival was 7.7 months.

Here, we showed that co-treatment with subtoxic doses of dioscin and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Caki human renal cancer cells. Treatment of Caki cells with dioscin downregulated c-FLIPL and Bcl-2 proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Dioscin-induced decrease in c-FLIPL protein levels may be caused by the increased protein instability. We also found that dioscin induced downregulation of Bcl-2 at the transcriptional level. Pretreatment with NAC slightly inhibited the expression levels of c-FLIPL downregulated by the treatment of dioscin, suggesting that dioscin is partially dependent on the generation of ROS for downregulation of c-FLIPL. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that dioscin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human renal cancer cells by downregulation of c-FLIPL and Bcl-2.","['Kim, Yong-Sik', 'Kim, Eun-Ae', 'Park, Kyu-Gun', 'Lee, Sung-Jun', 'Kim, Mi-Sun', 'Sohn, Ho-Yong', 'Lee, Tae-Jin']","['Kim YS', 'Kim EA', 'Park KG', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim MS', 'Sohn HY', 'Lee TJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Chungnam 330-090, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120809,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '3B95U4OLWV (dioscin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'K49P2K8WLX (Diosgenin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Diosgenin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1962 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Nov;28(5):1910-6. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1962.

Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) present in colorectal cancer tissues, are responsible for resistance to conventional therapies. Therefore, effective recognition of CSCs is of great importance. In the present study, to explore the potential characterizations of CSCs by the expression of specific cell surface markers such as CD133 and CD44, we screened six CRC cell lines using western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. SW620, one of the six cell lines analyzed, was sorted into four subpopulations by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The capability of colony formation, proliferation rate, apoptosis, drug resistance, as well as their migratory and invasion potential were detected. The results revealed that the combination of CD44 and CD133 correlates with the features of CSCs in SW620 cells. CD44 positive cells showed more robust colony formation, higher proliferation, less spontaneous apoptosis, a higher resistance to drug-induced cell death, and were enriched after drug treatment. Among CD44 positive SW620 cells, the CD133 negative subpopulation was more migratory and invasive, which means that CD44+CD133- correlates with most of features proposed for CSCs. Overall, the data presented herein showed that CRCs have a wide range of expression for CD44 and CD133; it is unlikely the CSCs can be characterized by any single marker or the same set of markers for all colon cancer cells. For SW620 cells, the CSCs are likely represented by the CD44+CD133- surface marker. This finding of CSC markers represented by one positive and one negative is in line with CSCs in other tumors, such as CD34+CD38- for acute myeloid leukemia; CD44+CD24- for breast and pancreatic tumors. The absence of surface molecule(s) on CSCs will make it even more difficult to track and target this group of minority cells.","['Wang, Chunxia', 'Xie, Jingping', 'Guo, Jiasong', 'Manning, H Charles', 'Gore, John C', 'Guo, Ning']","['Wang C', 'Xie J', 'Guo J', 'Manning HC', 'Gore JC', 'Guo N']","['Department of Pharmacy, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120806,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1951 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1301-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1951.

Additionally, P15(ink4b) methylation status was analyzed (for 15 patients) pre- and post-DAA treatment, and in vitro drug sensitivity tests were performed for seven patients (AA or AA + decitabine) to explore the role of decitabine in this combination treatment regimen. A total of 11 patients (55.0 %) achieved complete remission (CR) after DAA treatment, including 7 of whom reached CR after only one treatment course. The other two patients achieved partial remission. The median overall survival (OS) was 10 months for all 20 patients. The median OS for those who achieved CR was significantly longer than that of patients with no response (NR; P = 0.01). The treatment regimen was well tolerated, and there was no treatment-related mortality. The mean levels of P15(ink4b) methylation decreased significantly in six patients who achieved CR, whereas very few changes in P15 (ink4b) methylation were detected for the five patients with NR following DAA treatment. The data from the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays showed that the inhibition rates of AA and DAA for tumor cells were identical. We conclude that induction therapy with DAA for refractory/relapsed de novo AML or MDS/AML achieved high levels of CR and improved OS and demonstrated adequate tolerance. Moreover, the decitabine component of DAA may function through a demethylation effect.","['Song, Lu Xi', 'Xu, Li', 'Li, Xiao', 'Chang, Chun Kang', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Wu, Ling Yun', 'He, Qi', 'Zhang, Qing Xia', 'Li, Xiang']","['Song LX', 'Xu L', 'Li X', 'Chang CK', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu LY', 'He Q', 'Zhang QX', 'Li X']","[""Department of Hematology, Sixth Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University, Yisan Road 600, Shanghai, People's Republic of China, 200233.""]",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20120816,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1550-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Dec;91(12):1879-86. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1550-y.

Transcriptional regulation is one of the most fundamental processes in lung AC development. However, high-throughput functional analyses of multiple transcription factors and their target genes in lung AC are rare. Thus, the objective of our study was to interpret the mechanisms of human AC through the regulatory network using the GSE2514 microarray data. Our results identified the genes peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB), ets variant 4 (ETV4), Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1), T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1) as hub nodes in the transcriptome network. Among these genes, it appears that: PPARG promotes the PPAR signaling pathway via the upregulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, but suppresses the cell cycle pathway via downregulation of growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma (GADD45G) expression; ETV4 stimulates matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) expression to induce the bladder cancer pathway; FLI upregulates transforming growth factor, beta receptor II (TGFBR2) expression to activate TGF-beta signaling and upregulates cyclin D3 (CCND3) expression to promote the cell cycle pathway; NFKB1 upregulates interleukin 1, beta (IL-1B) expression and initiates the prostate cancer pathway; CEBPB upregulates IL-6 expression and promotes pathways in cancer; and TAL1 promotes kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) expression to promote the TGF-beta signaling pathway. This transcriptional regulation analysis may provide an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of lung AC.","['Meng, Xiangrui', 'Lu, Peng', 'Bai, Hua', 'Xiao, Peng', 'Fan, Qingxia']","['Meng X', 'Lu P', 'Bai H', 'Xiao P', 'Fan Q']","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120814,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (ETV4 protein, human)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Adenovirus E1A Proteins/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'Cyclin D3/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2012.1034 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2012 Nov;6(5):961-6. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2012.1034.

The histopathology of these skin lesions is not clearly defined, and few data are available in the literature. To better understand tumoral skin involvements in CMML we carried out an extensive, retrospective clinicopathologic study of 42 cases selected from the database of the French Study Group of Cutaneous Lymphomas. On the basis of clinical data, morphology, and phenotype we identified 4 clinicopathologic profiles representing 4 distinct groups. The first group comprised myelomonocytic cell tumors (n=18), exhibiting a proliferation of granulocytic or monocytic blast cells, which were CD68 and/or MPO positive but negative for dendritic cell markers. The second group comprised mature plasmacytoid dendritic cell tumors (n=16), denoted by a proliferation of mature plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which were CD123, TCL1, and CD303 positive but CD56, CD1a, and S100 negative. The third group comprised blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell tumors (n=4), characterized by a proliferation of monomorphous medium-sized blast cells, which were CD4, CD56, CD123, TCL1 positive but CD1a and S100 negative. The fourth group consisted of a putatively novel category of tumor that we named blastic indeterminate dendritic cell tumors (n=4), distinguished by a proliferation of large blast cells that not only exhibited monocytic markers but also the dendritic markers CD1a and S100. These 4 groups showed distinctive outcomes. Finally, we showed, by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, a clonal link between bone marrow disease and skin lesions in 4 patients. Herein, we have described a novel scheme for pathologists and physicians to handle specific lesions in CMML, which correspond to a spectrum of myelomonocytic and dendritic cell proliferations with different outcomes. A minimal panel of immunohistochemical markers including CD68, CD1a, S100, Langerin, and CD123 is necessary to make the correct classification in this spectrum of cutaneous CMML tumors, in which dendritic cell lineage plays an important role.","['Vitte, Franck', 'Fabiani, Bettina', 'Benet, Claire', 'Dalac, Sophie', 'Balme, Brigitte', 'Delattre, Claire', 'Vergier, Beatrice', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Vignon-Pennamen, Dominique', 'Ortonne, Nicolas', 'Algros, Marie Paule', 'Carlotti, Agnes', 'Samaleire, Dimitri', 'Frouin, Eric', 'Levy, Anne', 'Laroche, Liliane', 'Theate, Ivan', 'Monnien, Franck', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Petrella, Tony']","['Vitte F', 'Fabiani B', 'Benet C', 'Dalac S', 'Balme B', 'Delattre C', 'Vergier B', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Vignon-Pennamen D', 'Ortonne N', 'Algros MP', 'Carlotti A', 'Samaleire D', 'Frouin E', 'Levy A', 'Laroche L', 'Theate I', 'Monnien F', 'Mugneret F', 'Petrella T']","['Department of Pathology, CHU Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/metabolism/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Rate']",2012/08/17 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31825dd4de [doi]', '00000478-201209000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2012 Sep;36(9):1302-16. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31825dd4de.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous non-random genetic abnormalities are known, among which several translocations such as PLZF/RARalpha or AML1/ETO are known to aberrantly recruit histone deacetylases. Deacetylase inhibitors (DACi) are promising drugs leading to growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, premature senescence and apoptosis in malignant cells. It is believed that DACi may have clinical efficacy by eradicating the most primitive population of leukemic stem and progenitor cells, possibly by interfering with self-renewal. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of DACi on leukemic stem and progenitor cells using murine transduction-transplantation models of hematopoietic cells harboring the leukemia-associated fusion proteins (LAFP) PLZF/RARalpha or a truncated AML1/ETO protein (AML1/ETO exon 9). We show that the self-renewal and short-term repopulation capacity of AML1/ETO- or PLZF/RARalpha-expressing Sca1+/lin- stem and progenitor cells are profoundly inhibited by clinically applicable concentrations of the DACi dacinostat and vorinostat. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects, we examined the impact of DACi on the transcription factor c-MYC and the Polycomb group protein BMI1, which are induced by LAFP and involved in leukemic transformation. In AML1/ETO or PLZF/RARalpha-positive 32D cells, DACi-mediated antiproliferative effects were associated with downregulation of BMI1 and c-MYC protein levels. Similar effects were demonstrated in primary samples of cytogenetically defined high-risk AML patients. In conclusion, DACi may be effective as maintenance therapy by negatively interfering with signaling pathways that control survival and proliferation of leukemic stem and progenitor cells.","['Romanski, Annette', 'Schwarz, Kerstin', 'Keller, Maren', 'Wietbrauk, Sarah', 'Vogel, Anja', 'Roos, Jessica', 'Oancea, Claudia', 'Brill, Boris', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Bug, Gesine']","['Romanski A', 'Schwarz K', 'Keller M', 'Wietbrauk S', 'Vogel A', 'Roos J', 'Oancea C', 'Brill B', 'Kramer OH', 'Serve H', 'Ruthardt M', 'Bug G']","['Department of Medicine II, Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vorinostat']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['21565 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.21565 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 Sep 1;11(17):3219-26. doi: 10.4161/cc.21565.

The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia and plays efficacious role in CML. However, imatinib has few inhibitory effects on SRC tyrosine kinase with response rate of Ph+ ALL lower and relapse more frequent and quicker compared with CML. Previous studies showed that oridonin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in many tumor cells. However, the anticancer activity and mechanism of oridonin in Ph+ ALL is unknown. To investigate the anticancer activity of oridonin, we examined its role in constitutively activated Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK, STAT5 and SRC pathway, mRNA level of bcr/abl gene, cell viability and apoptosis in Ph+ ALL SUP-B15 cells. Furthermore, we detected synergetic effect of oridonin plus imatinib. Our results showed that oridonin inhibiting activations of LYN (one of SRC family kinases) and ABL and their downstream Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT5 pathways, downregulated Bcl-2 but upregulated Bax protein and then induced apoptosis in Ph+ ALL cells. Oridonin plus imatinib exerted synergetic effects by overcoming imatinib defect of upregulating Akt/mTOR and LYN signaling. Additionally, we examined the effect of oridonin on the signaling pathways in the primary specimens from Ph+ ALL patients. Our data showed that oridonin remarkably suppressed activations of Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK and STAT5 pathway in these primary specimens and oridonin with imatinib exerted synergetic suppressive effects on mTOR, STAT5 and LYN signaling in one imatinib resistant patient specimen. Additional evaluation of oridonin as a potential therapeutic agent for Ph+ ALL seems warranted.","['Guo, Yong', 'Shan, Qingqing', 'Gong, Yuping', 'Lin, Juan', 'Yang, Xi', 'Zhou, Ruiqing']","['Guo Y', 'Shan Q', 'Gong Y', 'Lin J', 'Yang X', 'Zhou R']","['Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'raf Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['21460 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.21460 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2012 Nov;13(13):1244-54. doi: 10.4161/cbt.21460.

CD44 ligation with the antibody A3D8 has been found to induce apoptosis in human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells via activation of caspase-8. The mechanism of A3D8-induced caspase-8 activation was studied in APL NB4 cells. A3D8 induces lipid raft clustering which causes Fas aggregation as determined with a confocal microscope. A3D8-induced apoptosis is abrogated by the lipid raft disrupting agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk. Western blot analysis reveals that A3D8 binds to the standard form of CD44 (CD44s). HL-60 cells without detectable CD44s protein are not responsive to A3D8-induced apoptosis. SKNO-1 cells containing higher level of CD44s protein are more sensitive to A3D8-induced apoptosis than NB4 cells.

Two principal enzymes derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi are the only options clinically approved to date. We recently reported a study of recombinant L-asparaginase (AnsA) from Rhizobium etli and described an increasing type of AnsA family members. Sequence analysis revealed four conserved motifs with notable differences with respect to the conserved regions of amino acid sequences of type I and type II L-asparaginases, particularly in comparison with therapeutic enzymes from E. coli and E. chrysanthemi. These differences suggested a distinct immunological specificity. Here, we report an in silico analysis that revealed immunogenic determinants of AnsA. Also, we used an extensive approach to compare the crystal structures of E. coli and E. chrysantemi asparaginases with a computational model of AnsA and identified immunogenic epitopes. A three-dimensional model of AsnA revealed, as expected based on sequence dissimilarities, completely different folding and different immunogenic epitopes. This approach could be very useful in transcending the problem of immunogenicity in two major ways: by chemical modifications of epitopes to reduce drug immunogenicity, and by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues to diminish immunogenicity without reduction of enzymatic activity.","['Huerta-Saquero, Alejandro', 'Evangelista-Martinez, Zahaed', 'Moreno-Enriquez, Angelica', 'Perez-Rueda, Ernesto']","['Huerta-Saquero A', 'Evangelista-Martinez Z', 'Moreno-Enriquez A', 'Perez-Rueda E']","['Departamento de Microbiologia Molecular; Instituto de Biotecnologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Cuernavaca Morelos, Mexico. saquero@ibt.unam.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120816,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/chemistry/enzymology/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/chemistry/enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Rhizobium etli/chemistry/*enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Sequence Alignment']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['21710 [pii]', '10.4161/bioe.21710 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioengineered. 2013 Jan-Feb;4(1):30-6. doi: 10.4161/bioe.21710.

In the central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes are the major source for LIF, expression of which is enhanced following disturbances leading to neuronal damage. How astrocytic LIF expression is regulated, however, has remained an unanswered question. Since neuronal stress is associated with production of extracellular adenosine, we investigated whether LIF expression in astrocytes was mediated through adenosine receptor signaling. METHODS: Mouse cortical neuronal and astrocyte cultures from wild-type and adenosine A(2B) receptor knock-out animals, as well as adenosine receptor agonists/antagonists and various enzymatic inhibitors, were used to study LIF expression and release in astrocytes. When needed, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We show here that glutamate-stressed cortical neurons induce LIF expression through activation of adenosine A(2B) receptor subtype in cultured astrocytes and require signaling of protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs: p38 and ERK1/2), and the nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB. Moreover, LIF concentration in the supernatant in response to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide (NECA) stimulation was directly correlated to de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that LIF release did not occur through a regulated release pathway. Immunocytochemistry experiments show that LIF-containing vesicles co-localize with clathrin and Rab11, but not with pHogrin, Chromogranin (Cg)A and CgB, suggesting that LIF might be secreted through recycling endosomes. We further show that pre-treatment with supernatants from NECA-treated astrocytes increased survival of cultured cortical neurons against glutamate, which was absent when the supernatants were pre-treated with an anti-LIF neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine from glutamate-stressed neurons induces rapid LIF release in astrocytes. This rapid release of LIF promotes the survival of cortical neurons against excitotoxicity.","['Moidunny, Shamsudheen', 'Vinet, Jonathan', 'Wesseling, Evelyn', 'Bijzet, Johan', 'Shieh, Chu-Hsin', 'van Ijzendoorn, Sven C D', 'Bezzi, Paola', 'Boddeke, Hendrikus W G M', 'Biber, Knut']","['Moidunny S', 'Vinet J', 'Wesseling E', 'Bijzet J', 'Shieh CH', 'van Ijzendoorn SC', 'Bezzi P', 'Boddeke HW', 'Biber K']","['Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, A.

Our objectives were to document ranges of HTLV PVL across a broader spectrum of diseases and tissues, to quantify the normal range of intrapatient PVL variability, and to identify which PVL values and changes deserve further investigation. PVL was measured in 191 patients with HTLV-1-associated diseases and in 211 asymptomatic carriers, using real-time quantitative PCR. The intraassay variability increases as viral load decreases: 8% at high load, 17% at medium load, and 33% at low load. The interassay variability is not different from the intraassay. Mean intrapatient CV is 65% (SD 21) in asymptomatic carriers and 59% (SD 22) in HAM/TSP. PVL values varied widely between individuals, but were relatively constant within individuals. High PVL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lymph nodes (LN) was associated with disease but 57% of asymptomatic carriers had a PVL greater than 1% in PBMCs. Our results suggest that (1) PVL changes falling outside a coefficient of variation of 100% require more detailed assessment, (2) asymptomatic carriers with PVL higher than 10% should undergo more frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring, and (3) HTLV-1 PVL in blood and tissue is helpful in the diagnosis and monitoring of HTLV-1 infection.","['Demontis, Maria A', 'Hilburn, Silva', 'Taylor, Graham P']","['Demontis MA', 'Hilburn S', 'Taylor GP']","['Section of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120925,United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asymptomatic Diseases', 'Carrier State', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*pathology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Viral Load', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/17 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/08/17 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/AID.2012.0132 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2013 Feb;29(2):359-64. doi: 10.1089/AID.2012.0132.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One week after a lead-in rituximab dose, cohorts of three patients were treated with 30, 100, or 150 mug/kg rIL-21 weekly for four weeks, concurrent with four weekly doses of rituximab. Patients with stable disease or better were eligible for a second course of therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL, n = 11), follicular lymphoma (n = 9), or marginal zone lymphoma (n = 1) were enrolled, with 19 completing at least one course of therapy. The MTD for rIL-21 was 100 mug/kg, based on observed toxicities including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, edema, and hypophosphatemia. Clinical responses were seen in 8 of 19 evaluable patients (42%; 3 CR/CRu, 5 PR), with 4 of longer duration than the patient's previous response to rituximab-based treatment (median 9 months vs. 3 months). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient therapy of indolent B-cell malignancies with rituximab and weekly rIL-21 was well tolerated and clinically active, with durable complete remissions in a small subset of patients.

Cause of death was disease recurrence in 37 patients (58 %), infection in ten patients (16 %) and GVHD in six (9 %). One-year non-relapse mortality was 35 %. In multivariate analysis, performance status >/=80 % WHO and a full-matched donor were associated with a better outcome: these two variables allowed for risk stratification, identifying three groups with significantly different survival after transplant (P = 0.0001). Considering post-transplant variables, only CR at recovery and development of cGVHD were correlated with a longer survival.

We investigated pharmacologic interaction between the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737. Increased BCL-2 expression determined by reverse phase protein analysis was associated with poor survival in AML patients with unfavorable cytogenetics (n = 195). We found that 5-AZA, which itself has modest apoptotic activity, acts synergistically with ABT-737 to induce apoptosis. The 5-AZA/ABT-737 combination enhanced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, as evidenced by effective conformational activation of BAX and psi(m) loss. Although absence of p53 limited apoptotic activities of 5-AZA and ABT-737 as single agents, the combination synergistically induced apoptosis independent of p53 expression. 5-AZA down-regulated MCL-1, known to mediate resistance to ABT-737, in a p53-independent manner. The 5-AZA/ABT-737 combination synergistically induced apoptosis in AML cells in seven of eight patients. 5-AZA significantly reduced MCL-1 levels in two of three samples examined.

METHODS: We evaluated the records of six patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia who were treated with fludarabine as a first-, second-, or third-line therapy, at a dose of 40 mg/m(2), for three to five days per month and 6 to 8 cycles. RESULTS: Of the six patients investigated with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia who were treated with fludarabine, five (83.3%) were female, and their median age was 36.5 years (range 18 to 73). The median lymphocyte level was 3.4 x 10(9)/L (0.5 to 8.9). All patients exhibited a monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement at diagnosis. Two (33.3%) patients received fludarabine as first-line treatment, two (33.3%) for refractory disease, one (16.6%) for relapsed disease after the suspension of methotrexate treatment due to liver toxicity, and one (16.6%) due to dyspepsia. A complete hematologic response was achieved in all cases, and a complete molecular response was achieved in five out six cases (83.3%). During a mean follow-up period of 12 months, both the progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 100%. CONCLUSION: T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia demonstrated a high rate of complete hematologic and molecular response to fludarabine, with excellent compliance and tolerability rates. To confirm our results in this rare disease, we believe that fludarabine should be tested in clinical trials as a first-line treatment for T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.","['Costa, Renata Oliveira', 'Bellesso, Marcelo', 'Chamone, Dalton Alencar Fischer', 'Ruiz, Milton Artur', 'Hallack Neto, Abrahao Elias', 'Aldred, Vera Lucia', 'Pereira, Juliana']","['Costa RO', 'Bellesso M', 'Chamone DA', 'Ruiz MA', 'Hallack Neto AE', 'Aldred VL', 'Pereira J']","['Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo Hematology Department, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/16 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2012/08/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322012000700007 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2012(07)07 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2012 Jul;67(7):745-8. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2012(07)07.,PMC3400163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We carried out a population-based case-control study in a northern Italy community involving 83 cases with acute childhood leukemia diagnosed in the years 1998-2009 and 332 matched controls. We assessed residential exposure to benzene and to particulate matter </=10 mum (PM10) from motorized traffic using geocoded residences and detailed emission and dispersion modeling. Exposure to benzene, and to a lesser extent to PM10, appeared to be independently associated with an excess leukemia risk. When we stratified the study population by age and by leukemia subtype, the relative risk associated with benzene exposure was higher among children aged less than 5 years, and despite small numbers this relation appeared to be considerably stronger for acute myeloid leukemia than for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to low levels of benzene released from motorized traffic may increase the risk of childhood leukemia, and suggest a possible independent effect of PM10, although unmeasured confounding due to other pollutants cannot be ruled out.","['Vinceti, Marco', 'Rothman, Kenneth J', 'Crespi, Catherine M', 'Sterni, Antonella', 'Cherubini, Andrea', 'Guerra, Luisa', 'Maffeis, Giuseppe', 'Ferretti, Enrica', 'Fabbi, Sara', 'Teggi, Sergio', 'Consonni, Dario', 'De Girolamo, Gianfranco', 'Meggiato, Alessandro', 'Palazzi, Giovanni', 'Paolucci, Paolo', 'Malagoli, Carlotta']","['Vinceti M', 'Rothman KJ', 'Crespi CM', 'Sterni A', 'Cherubini A', 'Guerra L', 'Maffeis G', 'Ferretti E', 'Fabbi S', 'Teggi S', 'Consonni D', 'De Girolamo G', 'Meggiato A', 'Palazzi G', 'Paolucci P', 'Malagoli C']","['CREAGEN, Environmental, Genetic and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. marco.vinceti@unimore.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120815,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Particulate Matter)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/analysis', 'Benzene/analysis/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Particulate Matter/analysis/*toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']",2012/08/16 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/08/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10654-012-9727-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2012 Oct;27(10):781-90. doi: 10.1007/s10654-012-9727-1.

For these refractory or relapsed patients, there is an increasing demand to identify novel therapeutic approaches, which will highly rely on the use of xenotransplantation models in translational research. Given the critical role that the spleen plays in the hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis in adult mice, intrasplenic inoculation of ALL cells into immunodeficient mice may represent a feasible route for leukemic xenotransplantation. In the present study, engraftments via intrasplenic inoculation in anti-mCD122 mAb conditioned NOD/SCID mice were achieved in 5 out of 11 cases, and the engrafted cells reconstituted a complete leukemic phenotype. The engrafted cells sustained the self-renewal capacity of leukemia-initiating cells as tested by serial xenotransplantation and can be used for evaluation of antileukemic drugs. These data suggest that the combination of intrasplenic inoculation and the targeted depletion of CD122(+) cells could provide a novel approach for the xenotransplantation of ALL cells in NOD/SCID mice. Furthermore, this model can be used for stem cell research, long-term analysis of engraftment kinetics and in vivo drug tests.","['Wang, Na', 'Huang, Liang', 'Wang, Di', 'Wang, Jin', 'Jiang, Lijun', 'Zhou, Kuangguo', 'Yang, Yunfan', 'Xu, Danmei', 'Zhou, Jianfeng']","['Wang N', 'Huang L', 'Wang D', 'Wang J', 'Jiang L', 'Zhou K', 'Yang Y', 'Xu D', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120815,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,['0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', '*Spleen/cytology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*methods']",2012/08/16 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/08/16 06:00'],"['2012/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['21345 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.21345 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2012 Oct;13(12):1158-64. doi: 10.4161/cbt.21345.

Cumulus-oocyte complexes retrieved from slaughterhouse buffalo ovaries were matured in vitro and fertilized using frozen buffalo semen. After 18 h of co-incubation with sperm, the presumptive zygotes were cultured in modified synthetic oviductal fluid without (control) or with rhLIF (100 ng/ml). There was no significant difference in the overall cleavage rate up to morula stage however the development of blastocysts, hatching rate and total cell numbers were significantly higher in the LIF-treated group than control. Transcripts for LIFRbeta were detected from immature, in vitro-matured oocytes and in the embryos up to blastocyst stage, while transcripts for the LIF were detected from 8-16-cell stage up to blastocyst, which indicated that embryo-derived LIF can act in an autocrine manner on differentiation process and blastocyst formation. This study indicated that the addition of LIF to the embryo culture medium improved development of blastocysts, functional (hatching) and morphological (number of cells) quality of the blastocysts produced in vitro. The stage-specific expression pattern of LIF and LIFRbeta mRNA transcripts in buffalo embryos indicated that LIF might play an important role in the preimplantation development and subsequent implantation of buffalo embryos.","['Eswari, S', 'Sai Kumar, G', 'Sharma, G Taru']","['Eswari S', 'Sai Kumar G', 'Sharma GT']","['Department of Veterinary Physiology, Madras Veterinary College, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120814,England,Zygote,"Zygote (Cambridge, England)",9309124,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/*metabolism', 'Buffaloes', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2012/08/16 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2012/08/16 06:00'],"['2012/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0967199412000172 [pii]', '10.1017/S0967199412000172 [doi]']",ppublish,Zygote. 2013 May;21(2):203-13. doi: 10.1017/S0967199412000172.

Natural products represent a valuable source for the development of novel anticancer drugs. The present study was aimed at evaluating the cytotoxicity of a naphtyl butanone isolated from the leaves of Guiera senegalensis, guieranone A (GA). RESULTS: The results indicated that GA was active on 91.67% of the 12 tested cancer cell lines, the IC50 values below 4 mug/ml being recorded on 83.33% of them. In addition, the IC50 values obtained on human lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM (0.73 mug/ml) and its resistant subline CEM/ADR5000 (1.01 mug/ml) and on lung adenocarcinoma A549 (0.72 mug/ml) cell lines were closer or lower than that of doxorubicin. Interestingly, low cytotoxicity to normal hepatocyte, AML12 cell line was observed. GA showed anti-angiogenic activity with up to 51.9% inhibition of the growth of blood capillaries on the chorioallantoic membrane of quail embryo. Its also induced apotosis and cell cycle arrest. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified several pathways in CCRF-CEM cells and functional group of genes regulated upon GA treatment (P < 0.05), the Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation and ATM Signaling pathways being amongst the four most involved functional groups. CONCLUSION: The overall results of this work provide evidence of the cytotoxic potential of GA and supportive data for its possible use in cancer chemotherapy.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Eichhorn, Tolga', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Krusche, Benjamin', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Eichhorn T', 'Wiench B', 'Krusche B', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon. kuetevictor@yahoo.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120620,England,Cell Div,Cell division,101251560,,,,2012/08/16 06:00,2012/08/16 06:01,['2012/08/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:01 [medline]']","['1747-1028-7-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1747-1028-7-16 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Div. 2012 Jun 20;7(1):16. doi: 10.1186/1747-1028-7-16.,PMC3782753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 90-year-old man presented 8 years after endovascular aneurysm repair with general malaise, nausea, abdominal pain, and hyperbilirubinemia. His inflammatory blood markers were elevated, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed unusual fluid and soft tissue collection around the stent-graft. A presumptive diagnosis of stent-graft infection was made, and he was started on intravenous antibiotics because he was not fit for surgery. His condition gradually deteriorated in hospital. Four months later he died of sudden hemodynamic collapse and shock. Postmortem examination revealed large malignant periaortic lymphadenopathy with suggestion of stent-graft infiltration and chronic hemorrhage. Histology of the lymph nodes confirmed myeloid sarcoma. CONCLUSION: Soft tissue and fluid collections around an aortic stent-graft on CT are not always indicative of a graft infection; malignant tumors, although rare, should be considered.","['Mehta, Tapan A', 'Miller, Fiona N', 'Boyle, Jonathan R']","['Mehta TA', 'Miller FN', 'Boyle JR']","['Bedford Hospital NHS Trust, Bedford, UK. tapan.mehta@bedfordhospital.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Endovasc Ther,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,100896915,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Aortic Aneurysm/diagnostic imaging/*surgery', 'Aortography/methods', 'Autopsy', '*Blood Vessel Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/*instrumentation', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/*instrumentation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/diagnosis', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Shock/etiology', '*Stents/adverse effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2012/08/16 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/08/16 06:00'],"['2012/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1583/11-3444R.1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endovasc Ther. 2012 Aug;19(4):565-7. doi: 10.1583/11-3444R.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of Icsbp is decreased in the bone marrow of human subjects with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and studies in murine models suggest that Icsbp functions as an anti-oncogene for CML. We previously identified a set of Icsbp target genes that may contribute to this anti-oncogene effect. The set includes PTPN13, the gene encoding Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1, a Fas antagonist). We previously demonstrated that myeloid progenitor cells from Icsbp-knockout mice exhibit Fap1-dependent Fas resistance. In the present study, we determined that the Fas resistance of Bcr-abl+cells is Icsbp- and Fap1-dependent. We also found that treatment of Bcr-abl bone marrow cells with a Fap1-blocking peptide prevents in vitro selection of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant population. Therefore, these results have implications for therapeutic targeting of the Fas-resistant leukemia stem cell population and addressing TKI resistance in CML.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Bei, Ling', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Bei L', 'Eklund EA']","['The Feinberg School of Medicine and The Robert H.

Here, we describe the breadth of somatic and inherited mutations across the mitochondrial genome by sequence analyses of paired tumor and normal tissue samples from 226 individuals with five types of cancer using whole-genome data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. The frequencies of deleterious tumor-specific somatic mutations found in mtDNA varied across tumor types, ranging from 13% of glioblastomas to 63% of rectal adenocarcinomas. Compared with inherited mtDNA variants, somatic mtDNA mutations were enriched for nonsynonymous vs. synonymous changes (93 vs. 15; P < 2.2E-16) and were predicted to functionally impact the encoded protein. Somatic missense mutations in tumors were distributed uniformly among the mitochondrial protein genes, but 65% of somatic truncating mutations occurred in NADH dehydrogenase 5. Analysis of staging data in colon and rectal cancers revealed that the frequency of damaging mitochondrial mutations is the same in stages I and IV tumors. In summary, these data suggest that damaging somatic mtDNA mutations occur frequently (13-63%) in these five tumor types and likely confer a selective advantage in oncogenesis.","['Larman, Tatianna C', 'DePalma, Steven R', 'Hadjipanayis, Angela G', 'Protopopov, Alexei', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Gabriel, Stacey B', 'Chin, Lynda', 'Seidman, Christine E', 'Kucherlapati, Raju', 'Seidman, J G']","['Larman TC', 'DePalma SR', 'Hadjipanayis AG', 'Protopopov A', 'Zhang J', 'Gabriel SB', 'Chin L', 'Seidman CE', 'Kucherlapati R', 'Seidman JG']","['Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/*genetics', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics']",2012/08/15 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1211502109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1211502109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Aug 28;109(35):14087-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1211502109.

In this study, using whole-genome DNA sequencing (WGS) and confirmation by Sanger sequencing, we observed mutations identified in several genes not previously known to be recurrently altered in SMZL. In particular, we identified recurrent somatic gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH2, a gene encoding a protein required for marginal zone B cell development, in 25 of 99 ( approximately 25%) cases of SMZL and in 1 of 19 ( approximately 5%) cases of nonsplenic MZLs. These mutations clustered near the C-terminal proline/glutamate/serine/threonine (PEST)-rich domain, resulting in protein truncation or, rarely, were nonsynonymous substitutions affecting the extracellular heterodimerization domain (HD). NOTCH2 mutations were not present in other B cell lymphomas and leukemias, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; n = 15), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 15), low-grade follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 44), hairy cell leukemia (HCL; n = 15), and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (n = 14). NOTCH2 mutations were associated with adverse clinical outcomes (relapse, histological transformation, and/or death) among SMZL patients (P = 0.002).

HTLV-2 infection is prevalent among intravenous drug users, and the viral genome encodes the viral transactivator Tax, which is highly homologous to the transforming protein Tax from HTLV-1. However, the link between HTLV-2 infection and leukemia has not been established. In the present study, we evaluated the activity of HTLV-2 Tax in promoting aberrant proliferation of human CD4 T lymphocytes. Tax2 efficiently immortalized CD4(+) memory T lymphocytes with a CD3/TCRalphabeta/CD4/CD25/CD45RO/CD69 immunophenotype, promoted constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt, IkappaB kinase/NF-kappaB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and STAT3, and it also increased the level of Mcl-1. Disruption of these oncogenic pathways led to growth retardation and apoptotic cell death of the Tax2-established T cell lines. We further found that Tax2 induced autophagy by interacting with the autophagy molecule complex containing Beclin1 and PI3K class III to form the LC3(+) autophagosome. Tax2-mediated autophagy promoted survival and proliferation of the immortalized T cells. The present study demonstrated the oncogenic properties of Tax2 in human T cells and also implicated Tax2 in serving as a molecular tool to generate distinct T cell subtype lines.","['Ren, Tong', 'Dong, Wen', 'Takahashi, Yoshinori', 'Xiang, Di', 'Yuan, Yunsheng', 'Liu, Xin', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Sun, Shao-Cong', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Cheng, Hua']","['Ren T', 'Dong W', 'Takahashi Y', 'Xiang D', 'Yuan Y', 'Liu X', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Sun SC', 'Wang HG', 'Cheng H']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120813,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-II Infections/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62799-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.377143 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Oct 5;287(41):34683-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.377143.

The migratory mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is not completely elucidated, yet many of the initial studies have been based on current understanding of the leukocyte migration. A normal function of MSC is the ability of the cell to migrate to and repair wounded tissue. This wound healing property of MSC originates with migration towards inflammatory signals produced by the wounded environment [1]. A tumor and its microenvironment are capable of eliciting a similar inflammatory response from the MSC, thus resulting in migration of the MSC towards the tumor microenvironment. We have shown MSC migration both in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, we elucidate several in vivo methods to study MSC migration and mobilization to the tumor microenvironment. The first model is an exogenous model of MSC migration that can be performed in both xenograft and syngenic systems with in vitro expanded MSC. The second model utilizes transgenic-fluorescent--colored mice to follow endogenous bone marrow components including MSC. The third technique enables us to analyze data from the transgenic model through multispectral imaging. Furthermore, the migratory phenotype of MSC can be exploited for use in tumor-targeted gene delivery therapy has been efficacious in animal model studies and is an anticipated therapeutic device in clinical trials.","['Spaeth, Erika L', 'Kidd, Shannon', 'Marini, Frank C']","['Spaeth EL', 'Kidd S', 'Marini FC']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cell Tracking/*methods', 'Chondrocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteocytes/cytology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2012/08/15 06:00,2012/12/13 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-943-3_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2012;904:173-90. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-943-3_15.,,"['R01 CA109451/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 CA146381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current research, we have used a murine retrovirus-induced tumor cell line of C57BL/6 mouse origin, namely FBL-3 cells, as a model to study basic mechanisms of immunological control and escape during tumor formation. This study shows that tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells are able to protect against virus-induced tumor cells. We show here that there is an expansion of tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells producing cytokines and cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (GzmB) in the early phase of tumor growth. Importantly, we demonstrate that in vivo depletion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD8(+) T cells in FBL-3-bearing DEREG transgenic mice augments IL-2 and GzmB production by CD4(+) T cells and increases FV-specific CD4(+) T-cell effector and cytotoxic responses leading to the complete tumor regression. Therefore, the capacity to reject tumor acquired by tumor-reactive CD4(+) T cells largely depends on the direct suppressive activity of Tregs. We suggest that a cytotoxic CD4(+) T-cell immune response may be induced to enhance resistance against oncovirus-associated tumors.","['Akhmetzyanova, Ilseyar', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Brandau, Sven', 'Altenhoff, Petra', 'Sparwasser, Tim', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Akhmetzyanova I', 'Zelinskyy G', 'Schimmer S', 'Brandau S', 'Altenhoff P', 'Sparwasser T', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr 179, 45147, Essen, Germany. ilseyar.akhmetzyanova@uni-due.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120814,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Granzymes/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/virology']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1329-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2013 Feb;62(2):257-71. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1329-y.

Granulysin, a cytolytic granule protein, is expressed in cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, and is found in the sera as well, and functions as a cytotoxic and proinflammatory protein. Cytolytic proteins, such as granzyme B and perforin, have been shown to play crucial pathophysiological roles in NK/T cell neoplasms and have also been utilized for diagnostic purposes. Granulysin in NK-cell proliferative disorders, however, has yet to be fully analyzed. To elucidate the clinical relevance of granulysin in mature NK-cell neoplasms, we measured serum granulysin and analyzed cytolytic molecules immunohistologically. The median concentrations of serum granulysin were 39.0, 2.85, 2.8 and 1.35 ng/ml in ANKL, ENKL, CLPD-NK and healthy subjects, respectively (P < 0.01). Serum granulysin was significantly elevated in patients with ANKL compared with the levels in ENKL (P = 0.006) and CLPD-NK (P = 0.037). Furthermore, serum granulysin was correlated with whole-blood EBV viral load in ENKL and ANKL (P = 0.005) and was significantly reduced after treatment. Different expression patterns of cytolytic granule proteins were observed among the mature NK-cell neoplasms. Granulysin is closely associated with the characteristics of NK-cell neoplasms and serum granulysin may serve as a novel biomarker for these disorders.","['Sekiguchi, Nodoka', 'Asano, Naoko', 'Ito, Toshiro', 'Momose, Kayoko', 'Momose, Masanobu', 'Ishida, Fumihiro']","['Sekiguchi N', 'Asano N', 'Ito T', 'Momose K', 'Momose M', 'Ishida F']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 390-8621, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120814,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GNLY protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1159-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Oct;96(4):461-8. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1159-x.

The NPM gene is mutated in almost 30% of human acute myeloid leukemia cells. NPM interacts with p53 and p19(Arf), directs localization of p19(Arf) in the nucleolus and protects the latter from degradation. Hepatocyte odd protein shuttling (HOPS) is also a ubiquitously expressed protein that moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Within the nucleus of resting cells, HOPS overexpression causes cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. HOPS knockdown causes centrosome hyperamplification leading to multinucleated cells and the formation of micronuclei. We demonstrate a direct interaction of HOPS with NPM and p19(Arf), resulting in a functionally active trimeric complex. NPM appeared to regulate HOPS half-life, which, in turn, stabilized p19(Arf) and controlled its localization in the nucleolus. These findings suggest that HOPS acts as a functional bridge in the interaction between NPM and p19(Arf), providing new mechanistic insight into how NPM and p19(Arf) will oppose tumor cell proliferation.","['Castelli, M', 'Pieroni, S', 'Brunacci, C', 'Piobbico, D', 'Bartoli, D', 'Bellet, M M', 'Colombo, E', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Della Fazia, M A', 'Servillo, G']","['Castelli M', 'Pieroni S', 'Brunacci C', 'Piobbico D', 'Bartoli D', 'Bellet MM', 'Colombo E', 'Pelicci PG', 'Della Fazia MA', 'Servillo G']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (HOPS protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Transport']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012353 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.353 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Jul 11;32(28):3350-8. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.353.

However, the detailed mechanism by which bufalin induces the apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells is largely unexplored. METHODS: The acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 was treated with bufalin, then the proliferation was evaluated by cell viability assay and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry analysis. In addition, NB4 cells were treated by MEK inhibitor PD98059 in combination with bufalin, and the expression of survivin and activation of caspase-3 were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Bufalin inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of NB4 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, bufalin synergized with PD98059 to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of NB4 cells, which was associated with the downregulation of survivin expression and the upregulation of caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: Bufalin is a potential regimen to be used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to improve acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy.","['Zhu, Zhitu', 'Li, Enze', 'Liu, Yangyang', 'Gao, Yu', 'Sun, Hongzhi', 'Wang, Ying', 'Wang, Zhenghua', 'Liu, Xiaomei', 'Wang, Qingjun', 'Liu, Yunpeng']","['Zhu Z', 'Li E', 'Liu Y', 'Gao Y', 'Sun H', 'Wang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Liu X', 'Wang Q', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning Medical University, Jinzhou, PR China. zhuzhitu@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120810,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bufanolides/*therapeutic use', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Survivin']",2012/08/15 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['000339424 [pii]', '10.1159/000339424 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;128(3):144-50. doi: 10.1159/000339424.

We then show how small-group brainstorming led to the creation of a challenging scenario wherein highly optimistic family members of a 20-year-old young man with terminal acute lymphocytic leukemia responded to information about the lack of further anticancer treatment with anger and blame toward the staff. We illustrate how the facilitators, using sociodramatic techniques of doubling and role reversal, helped learners to understand and articulate the hidden feelings of fear and loss behind the family's emotional reactions. By modeling effective communication skills, the facilitators demonstrated how key communication skills, such as empathic responses to anger and blame and using ""wish"" statements, could transform the conversation from one of conflict to one of problem solving with the family.

Because the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is an important mechanism of leukemic stem cell interaction with marrow stroma, we tested whether plerixafor, an antagonist of CXCR4, may dislodge chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells from the niche, sensitizing them to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We initially treated mice with retrovirally induced CML-like disease with imatinib plus plerixafor. Plerixafor mobilized CXCR4(+) cells, but no difference was observed in leukemia burden, possibly reflecting insufficient disease control by imatinib. In a second series of experiments, we tested the combination of plerixafor with dasatinib in the same as well as an attenuated CML model. Despite much improved leukemia control, plerixafor failed to reduce leukemia burden over dasatinib alone. In addition, mice receiving plerixafor had an increased incidence of neurologic symptoms in association with CNS infiltration by BCR-ABL-expressing cells. We conclude that plerixafor is ineffective in reducing leukemia burden in this model but promotes CNS infiltration. Beneficial effects of combining tyrosine kinase inhibitors with plerixafor may be observed in a situation of minimal residual disease, but caution is warranted when disease control is incomplete.","['Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Fleischman, Angela G', 'Petersen, Curtis L', 'MacKenzie, Ryan', 'Luty, Samuel', 'Loriaux, Marc', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Woltjer, Randall L', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Agarwal A', 'Fleischman AG', 'Petersen CL', 'MacKenzie R', 'Luty S', 'Loriaux M', 'Druker BJ', 'Woltjer RL', 'Deininger MW']","['Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Benzamides', 'Benzylamines', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46370-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-355396 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Sep 27;120(13):2658-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-355396.

The molecular mechanisms for this cardiotoxicity remained unclear. This study aimed to elucidate whether microRNAs (miRs) participate in As2O3-induced QT prolongation. METHODS: A guinea pig model of As2O3-induced QT prolongation was established by intravenous injection with As2O3. Real-time PCR and Western blot were employed to determine the expression alterations of miRs and mRNAs, and their corresponding proteins. RESULTS: The QT interval and QRS complex were significantly prolonged in a dose-dependent fashion after 7-day administration of As2O3. As2O3 induced a significant upregulation of the muscle-specific miR-1 and miR-133, as well as their transactivator serum response factor. As2O3 depressed the protein levels of ether-a-go-go related gene (ERG) and Kir2.1, the K(+) channel subunits responsible for delayed rectifier K(+) current IKr and inward rectifier K(+) current IK1, respectively. In vivo transfer of miR-133 by direct intramuscular injection prolonged QTc interval and increased mortality rate, along with depression of ERG protein and IKr in guinea pig hearts. Similarly, forced expression of miR-1 widened QTc interval and QRS complex and increased mortality rate, accompanied by downregulation of Kir2.1 protein and IK1. Application of antisense inhibitors to knockdown miR-1 and miR-133 abolished the cardiac electrical disorders caused by As2O3. CONCLUSIONS: Deregulation of miR-133 and miR-1 underlies As2O3-induced cardiac electrical disorders and these miRs may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the handling of As2O3 cardiotoxicity.","['Shan, Hongli', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Cai, Benzhi', 'Chen, Xi', 'Fan, Yuhua', 'Yang, Lili', 'Chen, Xichuang', 'Liang, Haihai', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Song, Xiaohui', 'Xu, Chaoqian', 'Lu, Yanjie', 'Yang, Baofeng', 'Du, Zhimin']","['Shan H', 'Zhang Y', 'Cai B', 'Chen X', 'Fan Y', 'Yang L', 'Chen X', 'Liang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Song X', 'Xu C', 'Lu Y', 'Yang B', 'Du Z']","['Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine- Pharmaceutics of China, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120811,Netherlands,Int J Cardiol,International journal of cardiology,8200291,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MIRN1 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn133 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Atrial Remodeling/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects/physiology']",2012/08/15 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-5273(12)00961-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cardiol. 2013 Sep 10;167(6):2798-805. doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.07.009.

In this study, we explored the expression of p57kip2 in various myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subsets by real-time quantitative PCR, as well as the relationship between p57kip2 and CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4). We also searched the role of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signal in p57kip2 expression in vitro. The expression of p57kip2 decreased in MDS cases (low grade MDS, P<0.001, n = 46; high grade MDS, P<0.001, n = 21), compared with that in control group. Patients with poor karyotype (according to IPSS) had lower p57kip2 than that in the normal group (P<0.05). p57kip2 expression increased after treatment with decitabine in the cases that had achieved response (P = 0.009, n = 7). Additionally, a positive correlation between p57kip2 and CXCR4 was investigated (r = 0.652, P<0.001, n = 67). p57kip2 expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells of normal controls increased significantly when co-cultured with SDF-1 in vitro, which could be blocked by AMD3100, whereas SDF-1 only induced a mild increase in p57kip2 in MDS. In conclusion, low expression of p57kip2 is common in MDS, which may play an important role in MDS pathogenesis. Reduced response to SDF-1 contributed to low expression of p57kip2 in MDS cases.","['Zhao, Youshan', 'Guo, Juan', 'Gu, Shucheng', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Li, Xiao', 'Chang, Chunkang']","['Zhao Y', 'Guo J', 'Gu S', 'Zhang X', 'Li X', 'Chang C']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/15 06:00,2012/12/13 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000005 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Jul;17(4):220-8. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, the molecular mechanism of anticancer remains unclear. In the present research, we studied the anticancer mechanism of AST, including the changes in cell ultrastructure, such as the mitochondrion, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi complex, and cytoskeleton, the inhibition of Janus kinase 1(JAK1)/transduction and the activators of the transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway using rat hepatocellular carcinoma CBRH-7919 cells. Cell apoptosis was evaluated and the expressions of JAK1, STAT3, non-metastasis23-1 (nm23-1), and apoptotic gene like B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (bcl-xl), proto-oncogene proteins c myc (c-myc) and bcl-2- associated X (bax) were also examined. The results showed that AST could induce cancer cell apoptosis. Under transmission electron microscope, the ultrastructure of treated cells were not clearly distinguishable, the membranes of the mitochondrion, RER, Golgi complex were broken or loosened, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was degranulated.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) address many problems associated with NSCs from various sources, including the immune response and cell availability. However, due to inherent differences between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs, detailed characterization of the iPS-derived NSCs will be required before translational experiments can be performed. Murine piggyBac transposon iPSCs were clonally expanded in floating sphere colonies to generate primitive NSCs initially with serum-free media (SFM) containing the leukemia inhibitory factor and followed by SFM with the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) to form colonies of definitive NSCs (dNSCs). Primitive and definitive clonally derived neurospheres were successfully generated using the default conditions from iPSCs and ESCs. However, the iPSC-dNSCs expressed significantly higher levels of pluripotency and nonectoderm lineage genes compared to equivalent ESC-dNSCs. The addition of the bone morphogenetic proteins antagonist, Noggin, to the media significantly increased primary neurosphere generation from the iPSC lines, but did not affect the dNSC sphere colonies generated. The induction of the NOTCH pathway by the Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) improved the generation and quality of dNSCs, as demonstrated by a reduction in pluripotency and nonectodermal markers, while maintaining NSC-specific gene expression. The iPS-dNSCs (+DLL4) showed functional neural differentiation by immuncytochemical staining and electrophysiology. This study suggests the intrinsic differences between ESCs and iPSCs in their ability to acquire a dNSC fate that can be overcome by inducing the NOTCH pathway.","['Salewski, Ryan P', 'Buttigieg, Josef', 'Mitchell, Robert A', 'van der Kooy, Derek', 'Nagy, Andras', 'Fehlings, Michael G']","['Salewski RP', 'Buttigieg J', 'Mitchell RA', 'van der Kooy D', 'Nagy A', 'Fehlings MG']","['Division of Genetics and Development, Toronto Western Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120917,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Hes3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)alanyl)phenylglycine tert-butyl ester)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (delta protein)', '148294-77-3 (noggin protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Spheroids, Cellular/drug effects/physiology', 'Transcriptome']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0218 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Feb 1;22(3):383-96. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0218.

In this study, putative naive porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated. Porcine embryonic fibroblasts were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing Yamanaka's 4 genes. Emergent colonies were propagated in the presence of porcine leukemia inhibitory factor (pLIF) and forskolin. The cells expressed pluripotency markers and formed embryoid bodies, which gave rise to cell types from all 3 embryonic germ layers. The naive state of the cells was demonstrated by pLIF dependency, 2 active X chromosomes (when female), absent MHC class I expression, and characteristic gene expression profiles.

Understanding what governs these properties at the molecular level is crucial for stem cell biology and its application to regenerative medicine. Of particular relevance is to elucidate those molecular interactions which govern the reprogramming of somatic cells into ESC. A computational approach can be used as a framework to explore the dynamics of a simplified network of the ESC with the aim to understand how stem cells differentiate and also how they can be reprogrammed from somatic cells. RESULTS: We propose a computational model of the embryonic stem cell network, in which a core set of transcription factors (TFs) interact with each other and are induced by external factors. A stochastic treatment of the network dynamics suggests that NANOG heterogeneity is the deciding factor for the stem cell fate. In particular, our results show that the decision of staying in the ground state or commitment to a differentiated state is fundamentally stochastic, and can be modulated by the addition of external factors (2i/3i media), which have the effect of reducing fluctuations in NANOG expression. Our model also hosts reprogramming of a committed cell into an ESC by over-expressing OCT4. In this context, we recapitulate the important experimental result that reprogramming efficiency peaks when OCT4 is over-expressed within a specific range of values. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated how a stochastic computational model based upon a simplified network of TFs in ESCs can elucidate several key observed dynamical features. It accounts for (i) the observed heterogeneity of key regulators, (ii) characterizes the ESC under certain external stimuli conditions and (iii) describes the occurrence of transitions from the ESC to the differentiated state. Furthermore, the model (iv) provides a framework for reprogramming from somatic cells and conveys an understanding of reprogramming efficiency as a function of OCT4 over-expression.","['Chickarmane, Vijay', 'Olariu, Victor', 'Peterson, Carsten']","['Chickarmane V', 'Olariu V', 'Peterson C']","['Computational Biology & Biological Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stochastic Processes']",2012/08/15 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-6-98 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-6-98 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2012 Aug 13;6:98. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-6-98.,PMC3468383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ara-C dose for Group A was 3g/m2 x 2, and the AUC(0-4) was 5.131 +/- 0.936. The Ara-C dose for Group B was 2g/m2 x 2, and the AUC(0-4) was 12.245 +/- 3.863. The AUC(0-4) for Group B is more than twice the AUC(0-4) for Group A, and these results indicate that Fa conduces a synergistic increase in the concentration and AUC of Ara-C in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid. The pharmacokinetics between the different dose treatments was statistically different (P = 0.016). The differences in the ratios of C(Ara-u) to C(Ara-C), and in the Tmax between Groups A and B could indicate whether or not Ara-C combined with Fa. Although Group B demonstrates a higher AUC(0-4) with lower doses of Ara-C (2 g/m2 x 2), the adverse drug reaction (ADR) and bone inhibition were not more pronounced in Group B compared to Group A. These results are based on a limited number of case studies, hence, additional studies are necessary to support and prove this hypothesis.","['Liang, Aibin', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Fang, Yu', 'Li, Ying', 'Zhu, Deqiu', 'Chen, Fangyuan', 'Lu, Huina', 'Fu, Jianfei', 'Bo, Lanjun']","['Liang A', 'Zhang H', 'Fang Y', 'Li Y', 'Zhu D', 'Chen F', 'Lu H', 'Fu J', 'Bo L']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2012/08/15 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2012 Jul;67(7):635-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This agent is also currently under active investigation for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), as well as in drug combinations for some solid tumors and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Although treatment with lenalidomide has translated into a significant extension in overall survival in MM and MDS and has superior safety and efficacy relative to thalidomide, the mechanism of action as it relates to immune modulation remains elusive. Based on preclinical models and clinical trials, lenalidomide, as well as other structural thalidomide derivatives, enhances the proliferative and functional capacity of T-lymphocytes and amplifies costimulatory signaling pathways that activate effector responses and suppress inflammation. This paper summarizes our current understanding of T- and natural killer (NK) cell pathways that are modified by lenalidomide in hematopoietic neoplasms to inform future decisions about potential combination therapies.","['McDaniel, Jessica M', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Epling-Burnette, P K']","['McDaniel JM', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Epling-Burnette PK']","['Cancer Biology PhD Program, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120724,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2012/08/14 06:00,2012/08/14 06:01,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/513702 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2012;2012:513702. doi: 10.1155/2012/513702.

This study evaluates its utility for supporting leukemic cell growth in vitro and its impact on cell survival, growth, and differentiation. Our results showed that the standard viscosity alginates had compromised leukemia cell viability but lower viscosity alginates recovered cell viability and improved 3D cell proliferation (27 fold) compared to 2D cultures (18 fold). Conjugation with RGD peptides promoted further cell growth (43 folds). In general, 3D hydrogels supported high-density cultures better than 2D cultures. Leukemic cells formed densely packed cell clusters in alginate hydrogels and spontaneously differentiated into a more diverse myeloid population. The cell cycle data suggested that more cells go into active cycling with a G2/M arrest in alginate hydrogels and the presence of multiploidy confirmed maturation toward megakaryocytes. In summary, superior culture of leukemia cells in 3D hydrogels is demonstrated in this study accompanied by a potential role of physical cues influencing cell fate decision. Manipulation of biophysical and biochemical properties of alginate hydrogels permits the study of specific interactions and serves to provide a robust 3D platform for studying extrinsic contributions inside the bone marrow.","['Vu, Thao Thi Thu', 'Lim, Carine', 'Lim, Mayasari']","['Vu TT', 'Lim C', 'Lim M']","['Division of Bioengineering, School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120810,United States,J Biomed Mater Res B Appl Biomater,"Journal of biomedical materials research.

This phenomenon was attributed to inhibition of the proteasomal and protease-induced breakdown of misfolded N-CoR by curcumin. Curcumin is, however, a modest inhibitor and affected the viability of APL cells at micromolar concentrations. Modifying curcumin at its conjugated beta-diketone linker and terminal phenyl rings yielded potent congeners with sub-micromolar growth inhibitory activities which selectively kill APL cells over non-APL leukemic and nonmalignant cells. Analogues with pronounced APL-selective anti-proliferative activities, as observed in representative dibenzylidenecyclohexanones and dibenzylidenecyclopentanones, strongly promoted the accumulation of misfolded and nonfunctional N-CoR at significantly lower concentrations than their growth inhibitory IC(50) values. These compounds also inhibited the human 20S proteasome in an enzyme-based assay, thus providing convincing support for the prevailing hypothesis that impeding the degradation of N-CoR is a key mechanistic event contributing to APL cell death.","['Tan, Kheng-Lin', 'Koh, Siang-Boon', 'Ee, Rachel Pui-Lai', 'Khan, Matiullah', 'Go, Mei-Lin']","['Tan KL', 'Koh SB', 'Ee RP', 'Khan M', 'Go ML']","['Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, 18 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120806,Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Folding/drug effects', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cmdc.201200293 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2012 Sep;7(9):1567-79. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201200293.

We sought to describe the occurrence of melanoma as a subsequent neoplasm among adult survivors of childhood cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 14,358 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, we calculated the cumulative incidence, standardized incidence ratio (SIR), and absolute excess risk (AER) of subsequent melanoma. Potential risk factors were assessed using a cause-specific hazards model. RESULTS: Fifty-seven melanomas (46 invasive, 2 ocular, and 9 in situ) occurred in 51 survivors. The median time to the development of melanoma was 21.0 years (range: 5.6-35.4 years) and the median age at melanoma was 32.3 years (range: 10.9-49.0 years). Initial cancer diagnoses included soft tissue and bone sarcoma (n = 15), leukemia (13), lymphoma (14), central nervous system malignancy (5), Wilms tumor (3), and neuroblastoma (1). The cumulative incidence of first subsequent melanoma at 35 years from initial cancer diagnosis was 0.55% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-0.73]. The SIR of subsequent invasive malignant melanoma of the skin was 2.42 (95% CI: 1.77-3.23), and the AER was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.15) per 1,000 person-years. No statistically significant associations were found between melanoma risk and family history of cancer, demographic, or treatment-related factors. CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood cancer have an approximate 2.5-fold increased risk of melanoma. Early screening and prevention strategies are warranted.","['Pappo, A S', 'Armstrong, G T', 'Liu, W', 'Srivastava, D K', 'McDonald, A', 'Leisenring, W M', 'Hammond, S', 'Stovall, M', 'Neglia, J P', 'Robison, L L']","['Pappo AS', 'Armstrong GT', 'Liu W', 'Srivastava DK', 'McDonald A', 'Leisenring WM', 'Hammond S', 'Stovall M', 'Neglia JP', 'Robison LL']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. alberto.pappo@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120808,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24266 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Mar;60(3):461-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24266.

This study aimed at answering the question whether FPGC improved coverage for cancer care and to measure survival of FPGC affiliated children with cancer. PROCEDURE: A retrospective cohort study (2006-2009) was conducted in 47 public hospitals. Information of children and adolescents with cancer was analyzed. The coverage was estimated in accordance with expected number of incident cases and those registered at FPGC. The survival was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: The study included 3,821 patients. From 2006 to 2009, coverage of new cancer cases increased from 3.3% to 55.3%. Principal diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 46.4%), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (8.2%), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 7.4%). The survival rates at 36 months were ALL (50%), AML (30.5%), Hodgkin lymphoma (74.5%), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (40.1%), CNS tumors (32.8%), renal tumors (58.4%), bone tumors (33.4%), retinoblastoma (59.2%), and other solid tumors (52.6%). The 3-year overall survival rates varied among the regions; children between the east and south-southeast had the higher risks (hazard ratio 3.0; 95% CI: 2.3-3.9) and 2.4; 95% CI: 2.0-2.8) of death from disease when compared with those from the central region. CONCLUSION: FPGC has increased coverage of cancer cases. Survival rates were different throughout the country. It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy to increase access and identify opportunities to reduce the differences in survival.","['Perez-Cuevas, Ricardo', 'Doubova, Svetlana V', 'Zapata-Tarres, Marta', 'Flores-Hernandez, Sergio', 'Frazier, Lindsay', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Cortes-Gallo, Gabriel', 'Chertorivski-Woldenberg, Salomon', 'Munoz-Hernandez, Onofre']","['Perez-Cuevas R', 'Doubova SV', 'Zapata-Tarres M', 'Flores-Hernandez S', 'Frazier L', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Cortes-Gallo G', 'Chertorivski-Woldenberg S', 'Munoz-Hernandez O']","['Division of Social Protection and Health, Inter American Development Bank, Mexico City, Mexico. rperez@iadb.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120808,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Developing Countries/economics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', '*Medical Assistance', 'Medically Uninsured/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*economics/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24265 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Feb;60(2):196-203. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24265.

We performed a Phase I study for refractory and/or relapsed (R/R) leukemia in children to determine maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of time-sequential CLO followed by CY. PROCEDURE: Thirteen patients with (R/R) ALL (n = 8) and AML (N = 5), median age 9 years (range: 2-12 years), were treated with escalating doses of CLO on days 1, 2, 3 and 8, 9, 10 and CY 200 mg/m(2) /day on days 0 and 1 then 400 mg/m(2) /day on days 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10. Ten patients were treated at dose level 1 (DL1) (CLO 20 mg/m(2) /day) and three patients at DL2 (CLO 30 mg/m(2) /day). The average number of prior chemotherapies was 8.9. DNA damage testing was performed before treatment on day 0, and 2 hours after CY on day 0, before sequential CLO, CY treatment on day 1, and 2 hours after CLO followed by CY on day 1. RESULTS: Two patients at DL2 had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that included hypotension with cardio-respiratory failure (1) and hepato-renal failure (1). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 2/11 (18.2%) and partial remission (PR) in 2/11 (18.2%) for an overall response (OR) of 36.4%. The use of CLO before CY augmented CY-induced DNA damage in leukemic blasts compared to CY alone. CONCLUSION: In pediatric patients with R/R leukemia, 20 mg/m(2) /day is the MTD for CLO in timed sequential combination with CY. Increased DNA damage with the use of this combination suggests a mechanism for the sequential timing of these two chemotherapeutic agents.","['Abd Elmoneim, Abeer', 'Gore, Lia', 'Ricklis, Rebecca M', 'Boklan, Jessica', 'Cooper, Todd', 'Narendran, Aru', 'Rolla, Katherine', 'Scott, Tammy', 'Arceci, Robert J']","['Abd Elmoneim A', 'Gore L', 'Ricklis RM', 'Boklan J', 'Cooper T', 'Narendran A', 'Rolla K', 'Scott T', 'Arceci RJ']","['Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Bunting & Blaustein Cancer Research Building, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120808,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/14 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24264 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Dec 15;59(7):1252-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24264.

Subsets of cases show 3q26 rearrangements, such as inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26), frequently accompanied by chromosome 7 abnormalities. We investigated whether cytogenetically cryptic EVI1 rearrangements may cause EVI1 overexpression in myeloid malignancies without 3q26 abnormalities and investigated 983 patients with AML (n = 606) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; n = 377) with normal karyotype (CN-AML/CN-MDS, n = 594) or chromosome 7 abnormalities (n = 389) for EVI1 rearrangements using interphase FISH. We identified cytogenetically cryptic EVI1 rearrangements in 27 patients (19 AML, 8 MDS): inv(3)(p24q26) [n = 10]; t(3;21)(q26;q11) [n = 9]; and der(7)t(3;7)(q26;q21) [n = 8]. Elevated EVI1 expression was detected in nearly all cases with cryptic EVI1 rearrangements: Median %EVI1/ABL1 was 92.8 (range: 29.8-146.1) in inv(3)(p24q26), 104.9 (41.4-176.3) in t(3;21)(q26;q11), and 101.8 (4.4-210.4) in der(7)t(3;7)(q26;q21). This was similar to median %EVI1/ABL1 of 73.9 (range: 7.3-585.6) in an independent cohort of inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) and 67.1 (2.3-410.7) in other 3q26/EVI1 rearrangements. Healthy controls showed median EVI1 expression of 0.5 (range: 0.0-5.8). Using SNP microarray and sequencing analyses, the breakpoints of der(7)t(3;7)(q26;q21) were assigned to CDK6 and centromeric of EVI1, and of t(3;21)(q26;q11) to be within EVI1 and NRIP1. Median overall survival in patients with cryptic EVI1 rearrangements was short, comparable to patients with inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) or other EVI1 rearrangements. Cryptic EVI1 rearrangements contribute to explain the clinical heterogeneity of CN-AML and are associated with elevated EVI1 expression and an unfavorable prognosis. Screening for cryptic EVI1 rearrangements by FISH may be particularly appropriate in CN-AML with elevated EVI1 expression or in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 abnormalities.","['Haferlach, Claudia', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Grossmann, Vera', 'Schindela, Sonja', 'Zenger, Melanie', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schnittger, Susanne']","['Haferlach C', 'Bacher U', 'Grossmann V', 'Schindela S', 'Zenger M', 'Kohlmann A', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. claudia.haferlach@mll.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120808,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.21992 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2012 Dec;51(12):1079-85. doi: 10.1002/gcc.21992.

These memory impairments may be referable to damage to hippocampal structures resulting from CNS treatment. PROCEDURE: In the present study, we explored episodic memory and its neuroimaging correlates in 10 adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with cranial radiation therapy and both systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy and 10 controls matched for age and sex, using a subsequent memory paradigm after episodic encoding of visual scenes. RESULTS: We report behavioral, structural, and functional changes in the brains of the adult survivors. They demonstrated poorer recognition memory, hippocampal atrophy, and altered blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the hippocampus. Whole brain statistical map analysis revealed increased BOLD signal/activation in several brain regions during unsuccessful encoding in ALL survivors, potentially reflecting ineffective neural recruitment. Individual differences in memory performance in ALL participants were related to magnitude of BOLD response in regions associated with successful encoding. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings describe long term neuroimaging correlates of cognitive dysfunction after childhood exposure to CNS-targeted cancer therapies, suggesting enduring damage to episodic memory systems.","['Monje, Michelle', 'Thomason, Moriah E', 'Rigolo, Laura', 'Wang, Yalin', 'Waber, Deborah P', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Golby, Alexandra J']","['Monje M', 'Thomason ME', 'Rigolo L', 'Wang Y', 'Waber DP', 'Sallan SE', 'Golby AJ']","['Department of Neurology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-5461, USA. mmonje@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120808,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chemoradiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hippocampus/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*etiology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24263 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Feb;60(2):293-300. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24263.

Literature on sleep and fatigue during treatment is emerging. However, information on these subjects after treatment is sparse. This cross-sectional study examined sleep and fatigue in relation to depression and quality of life (QoL) after treatment for childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Sleep, fatigue, depression, and QoL were evaluated by parent proxy and/or child self-reports of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, the PedsQL multidimensional fatigue scale, the Children's Depression Inventory and the Child Health Questionnaire. All total scores were compared to Dutch norm references. RESULTS: Sixty-two children were included, being 36 (interquartile range 22-62) months after finishing treatment. Parents rated the ALL survivors as having more disturbed sleep, more fatigue and poorer physical QoL compared to the Dutch norm. ALL survivors themselves reported less sleep problems, less depressive symptoms, and better psychosocial QoL than the Dutch norm. More sleep disturbances and fatigue correlated with more symptoms of depression and a worse QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in parental and self-reports, including worse parental ratings, might be explained by worried parents and/or the adaptive style of the children. Impaired sleep and fatigue correlated with more depressive symptoms and a worse QoL.","['Gordijn, Maartje S', 'van Litsenburg, Raphaele R', 'Gemke, Reinoud J', 'Huisman, Jaap', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Gordijn MS', 'van Litsenburg RR', 'Gemke RJ', 'Huisman J', 'Bierings MB', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands. ms.gordijn@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120808,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/*epidemiology', 'Fatigue/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Self Report', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24261 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Mar;60(3):479-85. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24261.

A multiplex long-range PCR-based assay was developed to allow fast and reliable amplification of patient-specific BCR-ABL1 fusion sequences from genomic DNA. The localization of breakpoints was analyzed with respect to distribution within the breakpoint cluster regions, sequence features, and association to repetitive elements or motifs associated with DNA recombination. The genomic fusion sites of 59 pediatric CML patients showed a bimodal breakpoint distribution in BCR that was different from the distribution in adult CML cases, but with similarities to BCR-ABL1-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults. BCR breakpoints were found more frequently positioned within, or close to, Alu repeats than would be expected based on their overall sequence proportion.

To this aim, whole-transcriptome microarray together with an MS-based nontargeted analytical approach (via CE-TOF MS and UPLC-TOF MS) have been employed to carry out transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis was done using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software as a previous step for a reliable interpretation of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles. Rosemary polyphenols altered the expression of approximately 1% of the genes covered by the whole transcriptome microarray in both leukemia cell lines. Overall, differences in the transcriptional induction of a number of genes encoding phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes, as well as differences in the metabolic profiles observed in the two leukemia cell lines suggest that rosemary polyphenols may exert a differential chemopreventive effect in leukemia cells with different phenotypes. IPA predictions on transcription factor analysis highlighted inhibition of Myc transcription factor function by rosemary polyphenols, which may explain the observed antiproliferative effect of rosemary extract in the leukemia cells. Metabolomics analysis suggested that rosemary polyphenols affected differently the intracellular levels of some metabolites in two leukemia cell sublines. Integration of data obtained from transcriptomics and metabolomics platforms was attempted by overlaying datasets on canonical (defined) metabolic pathways using IPA software. This strategy enabled the identification of several differentially expressed genes in the metabolic pathways modulated by rosemary polyphenols providing more evidences on the effect of these compounds.","['Valdes, Alberto', 'Simo, Carolina', 'Ibanez, Clara', 'Rocamora-Reverte, Lourdes', 'Ferragut, Jose Antonio', 'Garcia-Canas, Virginia', 'Cifuentes, Alejandro']","['Valdes A', 'Simo C', 'Ibanez C', 'Rocamora-Reverte L', 'Ferragut JA', 'Garcia-Canas V', 'Cifuentes A']","['Laboratory of Foodomics, CIAL (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Metabolome/*drug effects', 'Metabolomics', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyphenols/*pharmacology', 'Rosmarinus/*chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transcriptome/*drug effects']",2012/08/14 06:00,2012/10/25 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/elps.201200133 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2012 Aug;33(15):2314-27. doi: 10.1002/elps.201200133.,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

High-resolution genotyping and loss of heterozygosity mapping was performed on DNA samples from 86 sAML and 117 dnAML patients, using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. Genes TP53, RUNX1, CBL, IDH1/2, NRAS, NPM1, and FLT3 were analyzed for mutations in all patients. We identified 36 recurrent cytogenetic aberrations (more than five events). Mutations in TP53, 9pUPD, and del7q (targeting CUX1 locus) were significantly associated with sAML, while NPM1 and FLT3 mutations associated with dnAML. Patients with sAML carrying TP53 mutations demonstrated lower 1-year OS rate than those with wild-type TP53 (14.3% +/- 9.4% vs. 35.4% +/- 7.2%; P = 0.002), while complex karyotype, del7q (CUX1) and del7p (IKZF1) showed no significant effect on OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that mutant TP53 was the only independent adverse prognostic factor for OS in sAML (hazard ratio 2.67; 95% CI: 1.33-5.37; P = 0.006). Patients with dnAML and complex karyotype carried sAML-associated defects (TP53 defects in 54.5%, deletions targeting FOXP1 and ETV6 loci in 45.4% of the cases). We identified several co-occurring lesions associated with either sAML or dnAML diagnosis. Our data suggest that distinct genetic lesions drive leukemogenesis in sAML. High karyotype complexity of sAML patients does not influence OS. Somatic mutations in TP53 are the only independent adverse prognostic factor in sAML. Patients with dnAML and complex karyotype show genetic features associated with sAML and myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Milosevic, Jelena D', 'Puda, Ana', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Berg, Tiina', 'Hofbauer, Michael', 'Stukalov, Alexey', 'Klampfl, Thorsten', 'Harutyunyan, Ashot S', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Gisslinger, Bettina', 'Burjanivova, Tatiana', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Pietra, Daniela', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Dvorakova, Dana', 'Robesova, Blanka', 'Wieser, Rotraud', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Suvajdzic, Nada', 'Tomin, Dragica', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Colinge, Jacques', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Kralovics, Robert']","['Milosevic JD', 'Puda A', 'Malcovati L', 'Berg T', 'Hofbauer M', 'Stukalov A', 'Klampfl T', 'Harutyunyan AS', 'Gisslinger H', 'Gisslinger B', 'Burjanivova T', 'Rumi E', 'Pietra D', 'Elena C', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Doubek M', 'Dvorakova D', 'Robesova B', 'Wieser R', 'Koller E', 'Suvajdzic N', 'Tomin D', 'Tosic N', 'Colinge J', 'Racil Z', 'Steurer M', 'Pavlovic S', 'Cazzola M', 'Kralovics R']","['CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120807,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations/statistics & numerical data', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/mortality', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23309 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Nov;87(11):1010-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23309.

In this study, we inoculated the anti-mouse CD122 monoclonal antibody conditioned NOD/SCID mice with the leukemia cells from 9 T-ALL patients and 1 cell line via the tail vein. Four of the 9 patients and the cell line were successfully engrafted. Flow cytometry detected high percentage of human CD45(+) cells in recipient mice. Immunohistochemistry showed infiltration of human CD45(+) cells in different organs. Serial transplantation was also achieved. In vivo drug treatment showed that dexamethasone could extend survival, which was consistent with clinical observation. These results demonstrated that we successfully established 5 xenotransplantation models of T-ALL in anti-mCD122 mAb conditioned NOD/SCID mice, which recapitulated the characteristics of original disease.","['Wang, Di', 'Wang, Na', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Ma, Shuyan', 'Geng, Zhe', 'Zhou, Pengfei', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Huang, Liang']","['Wang D', 'Wang N', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma S', 'Geng Z', 'Zhou P', 'Zhou J', 'Huang L']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Crown Bioscience Inc.

To improve and validate the detection of clonal chromosomal aberrations in leukemia, we designed a combined application of karyotyping with multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and addressed the expression and distribution of fusion genes among the subtypes of Chinese adult patients with de novo AML. Multiplex RT-PCR assays were performed on 477 samples from newly diagnosed AML patients, and cytogenetic data were obtained from 373 of them by R or G banding techniques and those in some cases were confirmed by FISH. The PCR products in some suspected cases were tested by two-directional sequencing. The results showed that except unqualified samples, fusion genes were detected by multiplex RT-PCR in 211 of 474 patients (44.51%), including AML1-ETO, CBFbeta-MYH11, PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha, NPM-RARalpha, MLL rearrangements, BCR-ABL, DEK-CAN, SET-CAN, TEL-PDGFR, TLS-ERG, AML1-MDS1 (EVI-1). In 373 patients, who took both multiplex RT-PCR and karyotype analysis, the detection rate of chromosomal aberrations by using multiplex RT-PCR and karyotyping was 160/373 (42.89%) and 179/373 (47.98%) respectively, and the combination could optimize the detection rate of clonal genetic abnormalities to 216/373 (57.90%). The PCR results from 11 cases ""normal"" in karyotyping but abnormal in RT-PCR for MLL rearrangements were confirmed by two-directional sequencing. It is concluded that karyotype studies remain the cornerstone for genetic testing; conventional cytogenetics and molecular-based methods are complementary tests for the detection of clonal genetic aberrations in AML, especially for the cryptic or submicroscopic aberrations. Once a genetic marker has been identified by combined analysis, it could be used to monitor residual disease during/after chemotherapy, by quantitative RT-PCR and/or FISH.","['Geng, Zhe', 'Zhang, Heng', 'Wang, Di', 'Xiao, Yi', 'Wang, Na', 'Li, Chunrui', 'Huang, Liang', 'Zhou, Jianfeng']","['Geng Z', 'Zhang H', 'Wang D', 'Xiao Y', 'Wang N', 'Li C', 'Huang L', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. lhuang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120811,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

This study investigated cancer and mortality of adults exposed to blue asbestos as children. METHODS: Data linkage to relevant health registries was used to identify cancers and mortality in a cohort of adults (n = 2,460) that had lived in an asbestos mining town during their childhood (<15 years). RESULTS: There were 217 (93 female) incident cancers and 218 (70 female) deaths among the cohort. Compared with the Western Australian population females had elevated mesothelioma, ovarian and brain cancers, and increased ""all cause"" and ""all cancer"" mortality. Males had elevated mesothelioma, leukemia, prostate, brain, and colorectal cancers, and excess mortality from ""all causes,"" ""all cancers,"" circulatory disease, diseases of the nervous system, and accidents.

The results showed that photo-Fenton processes employing Fe(III) and FeOx and the UV/H2O2 process were most efficient for mineralizing MTX, with 77, 82, and 90% of total organic carbon removal, respectively. MTX probably forms a complex with Fe(III), as demonstrated by voltammetric and spectrophotometric measurements. Spectrophotometric titrations suggested that the complex has a 2:1 Fe(3+):MTX stoichiometric ratio and a complexation constant (K) of 1.47 x 10(4) M(-1), indicating high MTX affinity for Fe(3+). Complexation partially inhibits the involvement of iron ions and hence the degradation of MTX during photo-Fenton. The UV/H2O2 process is usually slower than the photo-Fenton process, but, in this study, the UV/H2O2 process proved to be more efficient due to complexing of MTX with Fe(III). The drug exhibited no cytotoxicity against NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells when oxidized by UV/H2O2 or by UV/H2O2/FeOx at the concentrations tested.","['Cavalcante, Rodrigo Pereira', 'da Rocha Sandim, Lucas', 'Bogo, Danielle', 'Barbosa, Antonio Marcos Jacques', 'Osugi, Marly Eiko', 'Blanco, Matildes', 'de Oliveira, Silvio Cesar', 'de Fatima Cepa Matos, Maria', 'Machulek, Amilcar Jr', 'Ferreira, Valdir Souza']","['Cavalcante RP', 'da Rocha Sandim L', 'Bogo D', 'Barbosa AM', 'Osugi ME', 'Blanco M', 'de Oliveira SC', 'de Fatima Cepa Matos M', 'Machulek A Jr', 'Ferreira VS']","['Centro de Ciencias Exatas e Tecnologia (CCET), Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Av.

Here, we report the first example for a successful application of the structure-based virtual screening to identify two common inhibitors equipotent for the wild type and the most drug-resistant T315I mutant of BCR-ABL. Because both inhibitors were screened for having desirable physicochemical properties as a drug candidate and revealed micromolar inhibitory activities, they deserve consideration for further development by structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to optimize the anti-CML activity. We also address the structural features relevant to the stabilizations of the identified inhibitors in the ATP-binding sites. The results indicate that the inhibitors should be less stabilized by the hydrogen-bond interactions with the change of the receptor from the wild type to T315I mutant due to the replacement of the hydroxy group with the ethyl moiety in the ATP-binding site. Nonetheless, the inhibitors are found to be capable of maintaining the potency for the mutant through the strengthening of hydrophobic interactions to the extent sufficient to compensate for the loss of some hydrogen bonds. This differential binding mode may serve as key information for designing new common inhibitors of the wild type and T315I mutant of BCR-ABL.","['Park, Hwangseo', 'Hong, Seunghee', 'Hong, Sungwoo']","['Park H', 'Hong S', 'Hong S']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Sejong University, Kwangjin-Ku, Seoul, Korea. hspark@sejong.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120811,Netherlands,J Comput Aided Mol Des,Journal of computer-aided molecular design,8710425,"['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry', 'Binding Sites', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10822-012-9593-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Aided Mol Des. 2012 Aug;26(8):983-92. doi: 10.1007/s10822-012-9593-7.

However, the genetic cues modulating this metabolic switch remain largely undetermined. We identified a metabolic function for the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene, uncovering an unexpected role for this bona fide tumor suppressor in breast cancer cell survival. We found that PML acted as both a negative regulator of PPARgamma coactivator 1A (PGC1A) acetylation and a potent activator of PPAR signaling and fatty acid oxidation. We further showed that PML promoted ATP production and inhibited anoikis. Importantly, PML expression allowed luminal filling in 3D basement membrane breast culture models, an effect that was reverted by the pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis of breast cancer biopsies revealed that PML was overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers and enriched in triple-negative cases. Indeed, PML expression in breast cancer correlated strikingly with reduced time to recurrence, a gene signature of poor prognosis, and activated PPAR signaling. These findings have important therapeutic implications, as PML and its key role in fatty acid oxidation metabolism are amenable to pharmacological suppression, a potential future mode of cancer prevention and treatment.","['Carracedo, Arkaitz', 'Weiss, Dror', 'Leliaert, Amy K', 'Bhasin, Manoj', 'de Boer, Vincent C J', 'Laurent, Gaelle', 'Adams, Andrew C', 'Sundvall, Maria', 'Song, Su Jung', 'Ito, Keisuke', 'Finley, Lydia S', 'Egia, Ainara', 'Libermann, Towia', 'Gerhart-Hines, Zachary', 'Puigserver, Pere', 'Haigis, Marcia C', 'Maratos-Flier, Elefteria', 'Richardson, Andrea L', 'Schafer, Zachary T', 'Pandolfi, Pier P']","['Carracedo A', 'Weiss D', 'Leliaert AK', 'Bhasin M', 'de Boer VC', 'Laurent G', 'Adams AC', 'Sundvall M', 'Song SJ', 'Ito K', 'Finley LS', 'Egia A', 'Libermann T', 'Gerhart-Hines Z', 'Puigserver P', 'Haigis MC', 'Maratos-Flier E', 'Richardson AL', 'Schafer ZT', 'Pandolfi PP']","[""Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors)', '0 (Ppargc1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Obese', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Obesity/etiology/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/08/14 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['62129 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI62129 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Sep;122(9):3088-100. doi: 10.1172/JCI62129.

Therefore this 10-year retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate and document the pattern of childhood cancers in our locality. METHODS: We reviewed 438 childhood (</=15 years) malignancies diagnosed at the histopathology and hematology laboratories of our teaching hospital in a 10-year period (2001-2010). RESULTS: The 438 malignancies comprised 10.9% of all cancers. The maligancies frequently seen in early childhood (0-4 years) accounted for 46.1% and in late childhood (5-9 years) for 34.7%. Retinoblastoma (30.6%), Burkitt lymphoma (19.9%) and acute leukemia (16.9%) were the most common pediatric cancers. Unlike in most other parts of the world, acute myeloid leukemia was slightly more prevalent than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were notable differences, our findings were in broad agreement with those of most other sub-Saharan African series, but differed markedly from those in the Western world and other high income countries. Further studies are required to identify the environmental factors for the high prevalence of nonfamilial retinoblastoma and possibly acute myeloid leukemia.","['Ochicha, Ochicha', 'Gwarzo, Aisha Kuliya', 'Gwarzo, Dalhatu']","['Ochicha O', 'Gwarzo AK', 'Gwarzo D']","['Department of Pathology, Bayero University/Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria. ochicha@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120812,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/01/09 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12519-012-0363-3 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2012 Aug;8(3):235-9. doi: 10.1007/s12519-012-0363-3.

METHODS: Nationwide Inpatient Sample (year 2008) was used. All hospitalizations (regardless of their discharge status following hospitalization) among children aged </=18 years with a primary diagnosis of leukemia were selected. Leukemia was identified using ICD-9-CM codes in the primary diagnosis field. The presence of septicemia during hospitalization was identified using ICD-9-CM codes in the secondary diagnosis field. Multivariable linear regression analyses were made to examine the effect of septicemia on hospitalization charges and LOS. RESULTS: Totally 6220 hospitalizations were attributed to leukemia treatment. Among these, 787 had septicemia. The mean hospitalization charge for those with septicemia was $279,137 and for those without septicemia was $113,530. The average LOS for those with septicemia was 33.18 days while the LOS for those without septicemia was 13.79 days. Septicemia was associated with increased hospitalization charges and a prolonged duration of stay in hospital after adjustments for confounders (P<0.0001).

The presence of stereotyped and quasi-identical BCRs in different CLL patients suggests that recognition of specific antigens might drive CLL pathogenesis. Here we show that, in contrast to other B-cell neoplasias, CLL-derived BCRs induce antigen-independent cell-autonomous signalling, which is dependent on the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) and an internal epitope of the BCR. Indeed, transferring the HCDR3 of a CLL-derived BCR provides autonomous signalling capacity to a non-autonomously active BCR, whereas mutations in the internal epitope abolish this capacity. Because BCR expression was required for the binding of secreted CLL-derived BCRs to target cells, and mutations in the internal epitope reduced this binding, our results indicate a new model for CLL pathogenesis, with cell-autonomous antigen-independent signalling as a crucial pathogenic mechanism.","['Duhren-von Minden, Marcus', 'Ubelhart, Rudolf', 'Schneider, Dunja', 'Wossning, Thomas', 'Bach, Martina P', 'Buchner, Maike', 'Hofmann, Daniel', 'Surova, Elena', 'Follo, Marie', 'Kohler, Fabian', 'Wardemann, Hedda', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Jumaa, Hassan']","['Duhren-von Minden M', 'Ubelhart R', 'Schneider D', 'Wossning T', 'Bach MP', 'Buchner M', 'Hofmann D', 'Surova E', 'Follo M', 'Kohler F', 'Wardemann H', 'Zirlik K', 'Veelken H', 'Jumaa H']","['Centre for Biological Signaling Studies (BIOSS), Albert-Ludwigs Universitat Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Autoantigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2012/08/14 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['nature11309 [pii]', '10.1038/nature11309 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2012 Sep 13;489(7415):309-12. doi: 10.1038/nature11309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-ALL mainly affects children and young adults, and remains fatal in 20% of adolescents and 50% of adults, despite progress in polychemotherapy protocols. Therefore, innovative targeted therapies are desperately needed for patients with a dismal prognosis. Aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is a common event in T-ALL patients and portends a poor prognosis. Preclinical studies have highlighted that modulators of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could have a therapeutic relevance in T-ALL. However, the best strategy for inhibiting this highly complex signal transduction pathway is still unclear, as the pharmaceutical companies have disclosed an impressive array of small molecules targeting this signaling network at different levels. Here, we demonstrate that a dual PI3K/PDK1 inhibitor, NVP-BAG956, displayed the most powerful cytotoxic affects against T-ALL cell lines and primary patients samples, when compared with a pan class I PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941), an allosteric Akt inhibitor (MK-2206), an mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor (RAD-001), or an ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor (KU63794). Moreover, we also document that combinations of some of the aforementioned drugs strongly synergized against T-ALL cells at concentrations well below their respective IC50. This observation indicates that vertical inhibition at different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network could be considered as a future innovative strategy for treating T-ALL patients.","['Bressanin, Daniela', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Pagliaro, Pasqualepaolo', 'Pession, Andrea', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Bressanin D', 'Evangelisti C', 'Ricci F', 'Tabellini G', 'Chiarini F', 'Tazzari PL', 'Melchionda F', 'Buontempo F', 'Pagliaro P', 'Pession A', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0', '(2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-ylth', 'ieno(3,2-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (BAG956)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (MK 2206)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '81HJG228AB (Ku 0063794)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['579 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.579 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 Aug;3(8):811-23. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.579.,PMC3478458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controls were randomly selected, with a case/control ratio of 1:30 and matched on year of birth, from all non-neoplasm children insured in the same year when the index case was admitted. Annual summarized power (ASP, watt-year) was calculated for each of the 71,185 mobile phone base stations (MPBS) in service between 1998 and 2007. Then, the annual power density (APD, watt-year/km(2)) of each township (n=367) was computed as a ratio of the total ASP of all MPBS in a township to the area of that particular township. Exposure of each study subject to radio frequency (RF) was indicated by the averaged APD within 5 years prior to the neoplasm diagnosis (cases) or July 1st of the year when the index case was admitted (controls) in the township where the subject lived. Unconditional logistic regression model with generalized estimation equation was employed to calculate the covariate-adjusted odds ratio [AOR] of childhood neoplasm in relation to RF exposure. A higher than median averaged APD (approximately 168 WYs/km(2)) was significantly associated with an increased AOR for all neoplasms (1.13; 1.01 to 1.28), but not for leukemia (1.23; 0.99 to 1.52) or brain neoplasm (1.14, 0.83 to 1.55). This study noted a significantly increased risk of all neoplasms in children with higher-than-median RF exposure to MPBS. The slightly elevated risk was seen for leukemia and brain neoplasm, but was not statistically significant. These results may occur due to several methodological limitations.","['Li, Chung-Yi', 'Liu, Chih-Ching', 'Chang, Ya-Hui', 'Chou, Li-Ping', 'Ko, Ming-Chung']","['Li CY', 'Liu CC', 'Chang YH', 'Chou LP', 'Ko MC']","['Department and Graduate Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120809,Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Phone', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Taiwan']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0048-9697(12)00911-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.06.078 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 2012 Oct 1;435-436:472-8. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.06.078.

So far little is known about their effects on normal myelopoiesis. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the myeloid commitment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we treated CD34(+) cells with valproic acid (VPA). Our results demonstrate that VPA treatment induces H4 histone acetylation and hampers cell cycle progression in CD34(+) cells sustaining high levels of CD34 protein expression. In addition, our data show that VPA treatment promotes erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation. In fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of growth factor-independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites. Finally, we show that GFI1B inhibition impairs erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation induced by VPA, while MLLT3 silencing inhibits megakaryocyte commitment only. As a whole, our data suggest that VPA sustains the expression of stemness-related markers in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and is able to interfere with hematopoietic lineage commitment by enhancing erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation and by inhibiting the granulocyte and mono-macrophage maturation.","['Zini, Roberta', 'Norfo, Ruggiero', 'Ferrari, Francesco', 'Bianchi, Elisa', 'Salati, Simona', 'Pennucci, Valentina', 'Sacchi, Giorgia', 'Carboni, Chiara', 'Ceccherelli, Giovanni Battista', 'Tagliafico, Enrico', 'Ferrari, Sergio', 'Manfredini, Rossella']","['Zini R', 'Norfo R', 'Ferrari F', 'Bianchi E', 'Salati S', 'Pennucci V', 'Sacchi G', 'Carboni C', 'Ceccherelli GB', 'Tagliafico E', 'Ferrari S', 'Manfredini R']","['Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120810,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00344-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Dec;40(12):1043-1054.e6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.08.003.

The microarray screened 5 miRNAs namely miR-155, let-7g, miR-126, miR-130a and let-7b because of the large difference in their expression in diseased vs. that of healthy controls. The expression levels of before 5 miRNAs re-quantified by reverse transcription quantifiable polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were not always accordant in cells and plasma. The high and low plasma levels of miR-155 and miR-126 changed with ATL stage. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that there is a quantitative discrepancy between cellular and plasma miRNAs. The elevation of plasma miR-155 and the reduction in miR-126 correlated with poor prognosis, indicating their usefulness as a novel biomarker for the assessment of disease stage.","['Ishihara, Kaori', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Inokuchi, Naoko', 'Nagai, Kazuhiro', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Ishihara K', 'Sasaki D', 'Tsuruda K', 'Inokuchi N', 'Nagai K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K', 'Kamihira S']","['Central Diagnostic Laboratory of Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan. ishiha@nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120810,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(12)00099-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2012.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Dec;36(6):560-5. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2012.07.002.

Bosutinib is metabolized primarily through the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway. Inhibition of bosutinib metabolism by coadministration with the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole could potentially increase plasma concentrations of bosutinib, allowing for the study of bosutinib tolerability at supratherapeutic concentrations in a healthy subject population. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the safety profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of different dose combinations of bosutinib coadministered with ketoconazole in healthy adults, and determined whether supratherapeutic concentrations of bosutinib can be achieved with ketoconazole. METHODS: This was a randomized, Phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-group study conducted in healthy adults. Single oral doses of bosutinib 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mg or placebo were administered with ketoconazole and food on day 1; daily single oral doses of ketoconazole 400 mg were administered on days -1 and 1 through 4. RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects were enrolled. Their mean (SD) age was 32.0 (10.7) years (range, 18-50 years). The majority of the subjects (n = 44 [92%]) were white, 2 (4%) were black or African American, and 2 (4%) were of other races. Bosutinib was associated with acceptable tolerability at doses from 100 to 600 mg, with adverse events either mild (n = 30 [63%]) or moderate (n = 12 [25%]) in severity; no subject discontinued treatment due to adverse events, and no serious events were reported. Mean (SD) values for bosutinib 100 to 600 mg ranged from 58.4 (13.3) to 426 (100) ng/mL for C(max) and 2980 (802) to 23,000 (4020) ng.h/mL for AUC(0-infinity); mean AUC(0-24) and AUC(0-last) ranged from 876 (234) to 7080 (1640) ng. h/mL and from 2740 (854) to 22,200 (3630) ng . h/mL, respectively. C(max) and AUC were linear and dose proportional. Mean C(max) at 600 mg was 2.1-fold higher than the steady-state C(max) previously observed for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia who received bosutinib 500 mg once daily with food. CONCLUSIONS: Single doses of bosutinib up to 600 mg coadministered with multiple doses of ketoconazole were acceptably well tolerated in this small, selected group of healthy male volunteers. In addition, supratherapeutic exposure was achieved within this range for bosutinib when coadministered with ketoconazole.

Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and cytidine deaminase (CDA) are the key enzymes in the metabolism of Ara-C. Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of DCK and CDA, which contribute to susceptibility to Ara-C, have been identified in Africans and Europeans. However, there has been no report about the relation among three SNPs in DCK (rs115543896, rs72552079, and rs111454937) and two SNPs in CDA (rs2072671 and rs60369023), and their clinical response to Ara-C for a Chinese population. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether these five SNPs are associated with the therapeutic outcomes of Ara-C-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with AML. METHODS: A total of 151 Chinese patients with AML were enrolled in our study. SNPs genotyping were performed using the MassARRAY system by means of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) method. RESULTS: The results illustrated that DCKrs111454937 AA genotype was more frequent in patients with higher platelet count, and A allele frequency was significantly higher in the group pound40 years, lower white blood cell (WBC) count patients group and the group with platelet counts > 60'10(9)/L.

It offers the possibility of identifying impending graft rejection and recurrence of underlying malignant or non-malignant disease. Here we investigated the quantitative chimerism kinetics of 21 relapsed leukemia patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: A panel of 29 selected sequence polymorphism (SP) markers was screened by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to obtain the informative marker for every leukemia patient. Quantitative chimerism analysis of bone marrow (BM) samples of 21 relapsed patients and 20 patients in stable remission was performed longitudinally. The chimerisms of BM and peripheral blood (PB) samples of 14 patients at relapse were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients experienced leukemia relapse at a median of 135 days (range, 30 - 720 days) after transplantation. High recipient chimerism in BM was found in all patients at relapse, and increased recipient chimerism in BM samples was observed in 90% (19/21) of patients before relapse. With 0.5% recipient DNA as the cut-off, median time between the detection of increased recipient chimerism and relapse was 45 days (range, 0 - 120 days), with 76% of patients showing increased recipient chimerism at least 1 month prior to relapse. Median percentage of recipient DNA in 20 stable remission patients was 0.28%, 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.05%, 0.08%, and 0.05% at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively, after transplantation. This was concordant with other specific fusion transcripts and fluorescent in situ hybridization examination. The recipient chimerisms in BM were significantly higher than those in PB at relapse (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This SP-based RT-PCR assay is a reliable method for chimerism analysis. Chimerism kinetics in BM can be used as a marker of impending leukemia relapse, especially when no other specific marker is available.

Lineage determinant Runx proteins organize and assemble multi-protein complexes at sites of transcription within the nucleus and regulate both RNA polymerase II- and I-mediated gene expression. In addition, Runx proteins epigenetically control lineage determining transcriptional programs including: 1) architectural organization of macromolecular complexes in interphase, 2) regulation of gene expression through bookmarking during mitosis, and 3) microRNA-mediated translational control in the interphase nucleus. These mechanisms are compromised with the onset and progression of cancer. For example, the oncogenic AML1-ETO protein, which results from a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21, is expressed in nearly 25% of all acute myelogenous leukemias, disrupts Runx1 subnuclear localization during interphase and compromises transcriptional regulation. Epigenetically, the leukemic protein redirects the Runx1 DNA binding domain to leukemia-specific nuclear microenvironments, modifies regulatory protein accessibility to Runx1 target genes by imprinting repressive chromatin marks, and deregulates the microRNA (miR) profile of diseased myeloid cells. Consequently, the entire Runx1-dependent transcriptional program of myeloid cells is deregulated leading to onset and progression of acute myeloid leukemia and maintenance of leukemic phenotype. We discuss the potential of modified epigenetic landscape of leukemic cells as a viable therapeutic target.","['Zaidi, Sayyed K', 'Trombly, Daniel J', 'Dowdy, Christopher R', 'Lian, Jane B', 'Stein, Janet L', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Gary S']","['Zaidi SK', 'Trombly DJ', 'Dowdy CR', 'Lian JB', 'Stein JL', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Ave. N., Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120524,England,Adv Biol Regul,Advances in biological regulation,101572336,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics']",2012/08/14 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S2212-4926(12)00058-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbior.2012.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Biol Regul. 2012 Sep;52(3):369-76. doi: 10.1016/j.jbior.2012.05.001.

METHODS: The clinical manifestations, histopathological features, immunohistochemistry, treatment and prognosis were analyzed retrospectively in 10 cases of granulocytic sarcoma. RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 10 to 56 years (means = 35.8 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. Histologically, the malignant cells of granulocytic sarcoma grew in a diffuse pattern. The cytoplasm was scanty, with eosinophilic fine granularity in some cells. The nuclei were round or focally irregular, and had finely dispersed chromatin. The mitotic figures were visible. Immunohistochemical stains for MPO, CD43, CD117, CD34 and CD99 were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Granulocytic sarcoma can occur in patients of all ages with a male predominance. The diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma is assisted by the cytochemical stain for naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase and/or immunophenotypic analyses for MPO, CD43, CD117, CD34, CD99.

However, AML is a highly diverse disease and the limited overall efficacy of DLT in clinical practice emphasizes the importance of identifying a specific subgroup of patients who might benefit from this treatment approach. OBJECTIVE: To monitor the cellular immune response after DLT, we developed an active specific immunization strategy using in vitro generated AML-trained T cells to induce a highly specific antileukemic T-cell response and thus established a novel nonradioactive assay system to assess the antileukemia immunity by flow cytometry, correlated with [3H]-thymidine uptake. METHODS: The myeloid blasts derived from five patients with AML relapsed post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were first labeled with CFDA (5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester). To analyze the growth inhibitory potential of the donor T cells trained by AML progenitor cells, the myeloid blasts were induced to proliferate by means of a cytokine cocktail (50ng/mL of SCF; 25ng/mL of IL-3; 100ng/mL of GM-CSF; 100ng/mL of G-CSF; 2U/mL of EPO; 0.47g/L of transferrin; and 5x10(-5)mmol/L of 2-ME). The T cell mediated growth inhibitory potential was detected after 5 days by flow cytometry and correlated with [3H]-thymidine uptake. The simultaneous use of TO-PRO-dye and calibrate beads allowed not only the cell viability to be known but also allowed quantification of the effector function. RESULTS: Here, we applied a CFDA dye to track the proliferation and expansion of AML blasts in response to the cytokine cocktail in vitro. AML-trained T cells, expressed high levels of the activation markers CD25 and CD69, and were generated to recognize the leukemic progenitor cells and inhibit cytokine-induced leukemic cell proliferation, which is an active specific immunization strategy circumventing the identification of leukemia-associated antigens. The capability of proliferation inhibition of AML-trained T cells evaluated with our nonradioactive, CFDA-based assay provided comparable results with the classic [3H]-thymidine assay with an even lower ratio of effector to target cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the novel, nonradioactive, CFDA-based assay was a robust tool to monitor the antileukemic immune response after DLT in myeloid leukemias.","['Yang, Ting', 'Chen, Zhi-zhe', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Buhmann, Raymund']","['Yang T', 'Chen ZZ', 'Kolb HJ', 'Buhmann R']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120702,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Blast Crisis/*immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/immunology/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-2985(12)00154-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2012.06.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2013 Apr;218(4):548-53. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2012.06.014.

STUDY DESIGN: In this double-blind crossover study, we randomly assigned 162 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma to receive fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg, or placebo, in addition to propofol and topical anesthetic for 355 procedures. RESULTS: We found no significant differences among the 3 regimens in the frequency of pain (pain score > 0) or severe pain (pain score >/= 5) during recovery, or a >20% increase in hemodynamic/respiratory variables during anesthesia. Treatment with fentanyl 1 mcg/kg was associated with a lower frequency of movement during procedure compared with treatment with fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg (P = .0476) or treatment with placebo (P = .0545). The placebo group required longer time to recover (median, 18 minutes) compared with the fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg group (median, 9 minutes) (median difference 2.0, P = .007) and the fentanyl 1 mcg/kg (median 8 minutes), (median difference 2.0, P = .15).

With modern treatment regimens, survival in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) approaches 90%. Only about 70% of children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) achieve long term survival. Patients who relapse have a dismal prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed to improve treatment outcomes in newly-diagnosed patients with a poor prognosis and for patients with relapsed/refractory disease that have limited treatment options. One promising approach in treating haematological malignancies has been the use of monoclonal antibodies to target cell surface antigens expressed on malignant cells. Most success with monoclonal antibody therapy in the treatment of haematological malignancies has come in the setting of adult B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the addition of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to standard treatment regimens. In order to further advance treatment of haematological malignancies, novel monoclonal antibodies continue to be developed that target a variety of cell surface antigens. Several antibodies continue to be investigated in childhood leukaemias. This review will discuss the development of monoclonal antibodies that target a variety of cell surface antigens for the treatment of childhood ALL and the use of the anti-CD33 antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the treatment of childhood AML.","['Barth, Matthew', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Barth M', 'Raetz E', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120813,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology']",2012/08/14 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12002 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Oct;159(1):3-17. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12002.

Most of these children will achieve a second complete remission, but maintaining this remission remains difficult.

Efforts have been made and continue to focus on understanding the underlying biology that drives relapse. The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in relapsed ALL remains unclear, but many clinicians still favor this for high-risk patients given the poor prognosis with current chemotherapy alone. It is important to use new drugs with little cross-resistance in the treatment of relapsed ALL. New classes of agents are currently being studied.

B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with 7 recurrent genetic abnormalities is individually classified as a provisional entity. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is divided into two entities, ALK positive and ALK-negative. The pathogenesis of the former is involved with ALK gene rearrangement with several partner genes. Two borderline categories between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, and between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma are newly recognized as a distinct disease entity based on the overlapping morphological and genetic features. In the diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms, understanding the morphological features is fundamental.

The v-regions from the CD96-specific hybridoma TH-111 were isolated and used to generate a CD96-specific single chain fragment of the variable regions (scFv). An affinity maturated variant resulting in 4-fold enhanced CD96-binding was generated by random mutagenesis and stringent selection using phage display. The affinity maturated scFv CD96-S32F was used to generate bivalent mini-antibodies by genetically fusing an IgG1 wild type Fc region or a variant with enhanced CD16a binding. Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) experiments revealed that Fc engineering was essential to trigger significant effector cell-mediated lysis when the wild type scFv was used. The mini-antibody variant generated by fusing the affinity-maturated scFv with the optimized Fc variant demonstrated the highest ADCC activity (2.3-fold enhancement in efficacy). In conclusion, our data provide proof of concept that CD96 could serve as a target structure for effector cell-mediated lysis and demonstrate that both enhancing affinity for CD96 and for CD16a resulted in mini-antibodies with the highest cytolytic potential.","['Mohseni Nodehi, Sahar', 'Repp, Roland', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Brautigam, Joachim', 'Staudinger, Matthias', 'Schub, Natalie', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Humpe, Andreas']","['Mohseni Nodehi S', 'Repp R', 'Kellner C', 'Brautigam J', 'Staudinger M', 'Schub N', 'Peipp M', 'Gramatzki M', 'Humpe A']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120803,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD96 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibody Affinity/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Engineering', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology']",2012/08/11 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0042426 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16676 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e42426. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0042426.

While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML are often resistant. New therapeutic options are therefore needed for this fatal disease. Although more common in solid tumors, increased microvessel density was also reported in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and was associated with a significant increase of angiogenic factors, suggesting that vascularity in hematologic malignancies is a controlled process and may play a role in the leukaemogenic process thus representing an alternative therapeutic target. Carboxyamidotriazole-orotate (CTO) is the orotate salt form of carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), an orally bioavailable signal transduction inhibitor that in vitro has been shown to possess antileukaemic activities. CTO, which has a reduced toxicity, increased oral bioavailability and stronger efficacy when compared to the parental compound, was tested in this study for its ability to affect imatinib-resistant CML tumor growth in a xenograft model.

The role of aging of the microenvironment for leukemia initiation/progression has not been investigated in great detail so far. Clonality in hematopoiesis is tightly linked to the initiation of leukemia. Based on a retroviral-insertion mutagenesis approach to generate primitive hematopoietic cells with an intrinsic potential for clonal expansion, we determined clonality of transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) exposed to a young or aged microenvironment in vivo. While HPCs displayed primarily oligo-clonality within a young microenvironment, aged animals transplanted with identical pool of cells displayed reduced clonality within transduced HPCs. Our data show that an aged niche exerts a distinct selection pressure on dominant HPC-clones thus facilitating the transition to mono-clonality, which might be one underlying cause for the increased age-associated incidence of leukemia.","['Vas, Virag', 'Senger, Katharina', 'Dorr, Karin', 'Niebel, Anja', 'Geiger, Hartmut']","['Vas V', 'Senger K', 'Dorr K', 'Niebel A', 'Geiger H']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergic Diseases, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120806,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Separation', '*Cellular Microenvironment', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2012/08/11 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/08/11 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0042080 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-06251 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e42080. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0042080.

Previous studies have provided data both in favor and against a cell membrane carrier-mediated transport of endocannabinoids, using different methodological approaches. Because AEA and 2-AG undergo rapid and almost complete intracellular hydrolysis, we employed a combination of radioligand assays and absolute quantification of cellular and extracellular endocannabinoid levels. In human U937 leukemia cells, 100 nm AEA and 1 mum 2-AG were taken up through a fast and saturable process, reaching a plateau after 5 min. Employing differential pharmacological blockage of endocannabinoid uptake, breakdown, and interaction with intracellular binding proteins, we show that eicosanoid endocannabinoids harboring an arachidonoyl chain compete for a common membrane target that regulates their transport, whereas other N-acylethanolamines did not interfere with AEA and 2-AG uptake. By combining fatty acid amide hydrolase or monoacyl glycerol lipase inhibitors with hydrolase-inactive concentrations of the AEA transport inhibitors UCM707 (1 mum) and OMDM-2 (5 mum), a functional synergism on cellular AEA and 2-AG uptake was observed. Intriguingly, structurally unrelated AEA uptake inhibitors also blocked the cellular release of AEA and 2-AG. We show, for the first time, that UCM707 and OMDM-2 inhibit the bidirectional movement of AEA and 2-AG across cell membranes. Our findings suggest that a putative endocannabinoid cell membrane transporter controls the cellular AEA and 2-AG trafficking and metabolism.","['Chicca, Andrea', 'Marazzi, Janine', 'Nicolussi, Simon', 'Gertsch, Jurg']","['Chicca A', 'Marazzi J', 'Nicolussi S', 'Gertsch J']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, National Center of Competence in Research TransCure, University of Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120809,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (N-(3-furylmethyl)eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenamide)', '0 (OMDM-2 cpd)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Endocannabinoids/*metabolism', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'Glycerides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2012/08/11 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/08/11 06:00'],"['2012/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62798-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.373241 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Oct 5;287(41):34660-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.373241.

Because gender effects in the incidence of childhood cancers have been described, we hypothesized differences at the transcriptomic level in cord blood between male and female newborns as a consequence of fetal carcinogenic exposure. The objective was to investigate whether transcriptomic responses to dietary genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens show gender-specific mechanisms-of-action relevant for chemical carcinogenesis. METHODS: Global gene expression was applied in umbilical cord blood samples, the CALUX-assay was used for measuring dioxin(-like), androgen(-like), and estrogen(-like) internal exposure, and acrylamide-hemoglobin adduct levels were determined by mass spectrometry adduct-FIRE-procedure(TM). To link gene expression to an established phenotypic biomarker of cancer risk, micronuclei frequencies were investigated. RESULTS: While exposure levels did not differ between sexes at birth, important gender-specific differences were observed in gene expressions associated with these exposures linked with cell cycle, the immune system and more general cellular processes such as posttranslation. Moreover, oppositely correlating leukemia/lymphoma genes between male and female newborns were identified in relation to the different biomarkers of exposure that might be relevant to male-specific predisposition to develop these cancers in childhood. CONCLUSIONS/IMPACT: This study reveals different transcriptomic responses to environmental carcinogens between the sexes. In particular, male-specific TNF-alpha-NF-kB signaling upon dioxin exposure and activation of the Wnt-pathway in boys upon acrylamide exposure might represent possible mechanistic explanations for gender specificity in the incidence of childhood leukemia.","['Hochstenbach, Kevin', 'van Leeuwen, Danitsja M', 'Gmuender, Hans', 'Gottschalk, Ralf W', 'Lovik, Martinus', 'Granum, Berit', 'Nygaard, Unni', 'Namork, Ellen', 'Kirsch-Volders, Micheline', 'Decordier, Ilse', 'Vande Loock, Kim', 'Besselink, Harrie', 'Tornqvist, Margareta', 'von Stedingk, Hans', 'Rydberg, Per', 'Kleinjans, Jos C S', 'van Loveren, Henk', 'van Delft, Joost H M']","['Hochstenbach K', 'van Leeuwen DM', 'Gmuender H', 'Gottschalk RW', 'Lovik M', 'Granum B', 'Nygaard U', 'Namork E', 'Kirsch-Volders M', 'Decordier I', 'Vande Loock K', 'Besselink H', 'Tornqvist M', 'von Stedingk H', 'Rydberg P', 'Kleinjans JC', 'van Loveren H', 'van Delft JH']","['Department of Toxicogenomics, Maastricht University, 6200 MD, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120809,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '20R035KLCI (Acrylamide)']",IM,"['Acrylamide/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*metabolism', 'Fetus/*drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/statistics & numerical data', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/08/11 06:00,2012/12/28 06:00,['2012/08/11 06:00'],"['2012/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-0304 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0304 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Oct;21(10):1756-67. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0304.

High birth weight (or rapid fetal growth) is associated with risk of ALL, but the mechanisms are not understood. In a population-based epidemiologic study of childhood ALL, we utilized a haplotype-based approach to assess the role of eight genes involved in fetal growth and body size regulation in 377 childhood ALL cases and 448 controls. We found significant haplotype associations with risk of childhood ALL for IGF1 among non-Hispanics and Hispanics together (p = 0.002), for IGF2 among Hispanics (p = 0.040), and for IGF2R among Hispanics and non-Hispanics (p = 0.051 and 0.009, respectively). No haplotype associations were observed for IGF1R or the studied genes involved in body size regulation, including LEP, LEPR, GHRL, and NPY.

These findings for childhood ALL emphasize the importance of fetal growth, when lymphoid progenitor cells are not yet fully differentiated and therefore more susceptible to malignant transformation.

Pretreatment covariates, such as clinical and molecular predictors, have helped identify which patients are more or less likely to survive their disease using the currently available regimens. Progress in establishing optimized flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for detecting minimal residual leukemia has provided new potential tools for predicting outcome. However, the most important next step in using these techniques toward personalized treatment of AML would be developing effective and safe strategies for eradicating the residual leukemic cells that are likely chemoresistant. With further refinement and standardization of the assays, and the development of novel, effective, and molecularly targeted agents, monitoring of minimal residual disease is likely to be incorporated into AML guidelines.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L']","['Ravandi F', 'Jorgensen JL']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2012/08/11 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/08/11 06:00'],"['2012/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10/8/1029 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2012.0105 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2012 Aug;10(8):1029-36. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2012.0105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial compares 2 established methods for controlling symptomatic unilateral MPEs. Patients with unilateral MPEs were randomized to either daily tunneled catheter drainage (TCD) or bedside talc pleurodesis (TP). This trial is patterned after a previous randomized trial that showed that bedside TP was equivalent to thoracoscopic TP (CALGB 9334). The primary end point of the current study was combined success: consistent/reliable drainage/pleurodesis, lung expansion, and 30-day survival. A secondary end point, survival with effusion control, was added retrospectively. This trial randomized 57 patients who were similar in terms of age (62 years), active chemotherapy (28%), and histologic diagnosis (lung, 63%; breast, 12%; other/unknown cancers, 25%) to either bedside TP or TCD. Combined success was higher with TCD (62%) than with TP (46%; odds ratio, 5.0; P = .064). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients treated with TCD had better 30-day activity without dyspnea scores (8.7 vs. 5.9; P = .036), especially in the subgroup with impaired expansion (9.1 vs. 4.6; P = .042). Patients who underwent TCD had better survival with effusion control at 30 days compared with those who underwent TP (82% vs. 52%, respectively; P = .024).

We show that mouse Bap1 gene deletion is lethal during embryogenesis, but systemic or hematopoietic-restricted deletion in adults recapitulates features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Knockin mice expressing BAP1 with a 3xFlag tag revealed that BAP1 interacts with host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), and the polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2 in vivo. OGT and HCF-1 levels were decreased by Bap1 deletion, indicating a critical role for BAP1 in stabilizing these epigenetic regulators. Human ASXL1 is mutated frequently in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) so an ASXL/BAP1 complex may suppress CMML.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Lithium heparin plasma and serum samples from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with hyperleukocytosis were transported by either a pneumatic tube system or manual transport and analyzed either immediately or after 4 h. RESULTS: Pneumatic tube transported samples resulted in higher plasma potassium levels than manually transported samples. Serum potassium was lower than plasma potassium, confirming the suspicion of ""reverse"" pseudohyperkalemia. Letting the pneumatic tube transported samples stand on the bench for 4 h before centrifugation surprisingly resulted in decreased or unchanged plasma potassium. CONCLUSIONS: The reverse pseudohyperkalemia in heparin plasma samples from a CLL patient was caused by pneumatic tube transport. Our results suggest extracellular leakage of potassium, followed by active transport of potassium into intact leukemic cells. This is the first Swedish case of reverse pseudohyperkalemia in a CLL patient, where clinical suspicion of false hyperkalemia and awareness of the phenomenon lead to a rapid laboratory diagnosis. The demonstration of reverse pseudohyperkalemia prevented potentially dangerous medical interventions, such as potassium lowering treatment.","['Garwicz, Daniel', 'Karlman, Mattias']","['Garwicz D', 'Karlman M']","['Division of Clinical Chemistry and Blood Coagulation, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

We assessed the effect of a new strategy of therapeutic platelet transfusion on the number of transfusions and safety in patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised parallel-group trial at eight haematology centres in Germany. Patients aged 16-80 years, who were undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia or autologous haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation for haematological cancers, were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive either platelet transfusion when bleeding occurred (therapeutic strategy) or when morning platelet counts were 10x10(9) per L or lower (prophylactic strategy). Investigators undertaking interventions were not masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the number of platelet transfusions. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, NCT00521664. FINDINGS: 197 patients were assigned the prophylactic strategy and 199 the therapeutic strategy. Of 391 patients analysed, the therapeutic strategy reduced the mean number of platelet transfusions by 33.5% (95% CI 22.2-43.1; p<0.0001) in all patients (2.44 [2.22-2.67] in prophylactic group vs 1.63 [1.42-1.83] in therapeutic group), 31.6% (18.6-42.6; p<0.0001) in those with acute myeloid leukaemia (2.68 [2.35-3.01] vs 1.83 [1.58-2.10]), and 34.2% (6.6-53.7; p=0.0193) in those who had had autologous transplantation (1.80 [1.45-2.15] vs 1.18 [0.82-1.55]. We noted no increased risk of major haemorrhage in patients who had undergone autologous transplantation. In those with acute myeloid leukaemia, risk of non-fatal grade 4 (mostly CNS) bleeding was increased. We recorded 15 cases of non-fatal haemorrhage: four retinal in each transfusion group, and one vaginal and six cerebral in the therapeutic group. 12 patients died in the study: two from fatal cerebral haemorrhages in the therapeutic group, and ten (five in each treatment group) unrelated to major bleeding. INTERPRETATION: The therapeutic strategy could become a new standard of care after autologous stem-cell transplantation; however, prophylactic platelet transfusion should remain the standard for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. The new strategy should be used by some haematology centres only if the staff are well educated and experienced in the new approach and can react in a timely way to first signs of CNS bleeding.

HTLV-1 is the causative agent of an aggressive T-cell leukemia known as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and other inflammatory diseases. HTLV-2 infection has not been clearly associated with any disease condition. Although both viruses can transform T cells in vitro, the HTLV-1 provirus is mainly detected in CD4+ T cells whereas HTLV-2 is mainly detected in CD8+ T cells of infected individuals. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 encode accessory proteins p30 and p28, respectively, which share partial amino acid homology and are required for viral persistence in vivo. The goal of this study was to identify host proteins interacting with p30 and p28 in order to understand their role in pathogenesis. RESULTS: Affinity-tag purification coupled with mass spectrometric (MS) analyses revealed 42 and 22 potential interacting cellular partners of p30 and p28, respectively. Of these, only three cellular proteins, protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), hnRNP K and 60 S ribosomal protein L8 were detected in both p30 and p28 fractions. To validate the proteomic results, four interacting proteins were selected for further analyses using immunoblot assays. In full agreement with the MS analysis two cellular proteins REGgamma and NEAF-interacting protein 30 (NIP30) selectively interacted with p30 and not with p28; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNP H1) bound to p28 and not to p30; and PRMT5 interacted with both p30 and p28. Further studies demonstrated that reduced levels of PRMT5 resulted in decreased HTLV-2 viral gene expression whereas the viral gene expression of HTLV-1 was unchanged. CONCLUSION: The comparisons of p30 and p28 host protein interaction proteome showed striking differences with some degree of overlap. PRMT5, one of the host proteins that interacted with both p30 and p28 differentially affected HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viral gene expression suggesting that PRMT5 is involved at different stages of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 biology. These findings suggest that distinct host protein interaction profiles of p30 and p28 could, in part, be responsible for differences in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 pathobiology. This study provides new avenues of investigation into mechanisms of viral infection, tropism and persistence.","['Doueiri, Rami', 'Anupam, Rajaneesh', 'Kvaratskhelia, Mamuka', 'Green, Kari B', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Doueiri R', 'Anupam R', 'Kvaratskhelia M', 'Green KB', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120809,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '146410-60-8 (HNRNPK protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'HTLV-II Infections/*virology', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/08/11 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/08/11 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-64 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Aug 9;9:64. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-64.,PMC3464894,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR023647/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-four boys (48 prepubertal and 36 pubertal) were evaluated, including 50 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 10 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and 24 with solid tumors. The control group consisted of 24 healthy prepubertal and 24 pubertal boys. The levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), inhibin B, and testosterone were determined, and testicular volumes were measured. RESULTS: Patients in prepuberty and early puberty (Tanner stages 1-3) diagnosed with ALL/NHL or solid tumor presented normal serum reproductive hormone levels, whereas in ALL/NHL patients in Tanner stages 4-5, the mean values of inhibin B were significantly lower (45.18 +/- 33.85 vs. 153.57 +/- 71.44 ng/L, p = 0.0027). In patients with HL in Tanner stages 4-5, a statistically significant lower mean inhibin B level (100.44 +/- 67.45 versus 153.57 +/-71.44 ng/L, p = 0.0027), higher mean FSH level (6.3 +/- 3.6 versus 4.6 +/- 2.2 mIU/mL, p = 0.05), and higher mean LH level (5.9 +/- 4.0 versus 3.6 +/- 1.8 mIU/mL, p = 0.05) were observed. No statistically significant differences were noted in assessed hormones in patients with solid tumors, independently of Tanner stage.

This poses unique problems in the targeting of LSCs since these cells are found circulating in the majority of leukemia cases at diagnosis and are usually not detectable during remission states. Because most cases of leukemia relapse, it is suggested that LSCs remain quiescent in the marrow until they eventually proliferate and circulate again. This indicates that effective targeting of LSCs must occur not only in peripheral circulation but in the micro-circulation of the marrow. Targeting such interactions may overcome cell adhesion-mediated treatment resistance, other multi-drug resistance mechanisms, and opportunities for clonal evolution in the marrow environment. Targeting selectins and integrins, signal transduction mediators, and chemokine/cytokine networks in the marrow micro-circulation may aid in abrogating leukemia-initiating stem cells which contribute to disease relapse. LSCs possess surface antigen profiles and signal transduction activation profiles which may allow differential targeting as compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells.","['Liesveld, Jane']",['Liesveld J'],"['Hematology/Oncology Division, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120802,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2012/08/10 06:00,2012/08/10 06:01,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2012.00086 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2012 Aug 2;2:86. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2012.00086. eCollection 2012.,PMC3410612,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antibody', 'leukemia stem cells', 'signal transduction', 'targeting', 'vascular interactions']",,,,,,,

While there has been some success in developing PI3Kdelta inhibitors, progress in developing selective inhibitors of PI3Kgamma has been rather disappointing. This has prompted the search for alternative targets with which to modulate PI3K signaling specifically in the immune system. One such target is the SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1 (SHIP-1) which de-phosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P(3) at the D5 position of the inositol ring to create PI(3,4)P(2). In this article, we first describe the current state of PI3K isoform-selective inhibitor development. We then focus on the structure of SHIP-1 and its function in the immune system. Finally, we consider the current state of development of small molecule compounds that potently and selectively modulate SHIP activity and which offer novel opportunities to manipulate PI3K mediated signaling in the immune system.","['Blunt, Matthew D', 'Ward, Stephen G']","['Blunt MD', 'Ward SG']","['Inflammatory Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath Bath, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120802,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2012/08/10 06:00,2012/08/10 06:01,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2012.00226 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2012 Aug 2;3:226. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00226. eCollection 2012.,PMC3410520,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K', 'SHIP-1', 'SHIP-2', 'activators', 'inflammation', 'inhibitors', 'leukemia', 'lymphocytes']",,,,,,,

To date, the conventional treatments for retinoblastoma have been enucleation, cryotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Most of these treatments, however, have possible side effects, including blindness, infections, fever, gastrointestinal toxicity, and neurotoxicity. More effective treatments are therefore imperative. Gossypol has been reported as a potential inhibitor of cell proliferation in various types of cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, and lung cancer. This study investigates the possible antiproliferative effect of gossypol on retinoblastoma. METHODS: Human retinoblastoma cells were cultured with various concentrations of gossypol and checked for cell viability with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Nuclear condensation caused by cell apoptosis was detected by staining retinoblastoma cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), counting those with condensed nuclei, and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells. In addition, the stages of apoptosis and phases in cell cycles were examined with flow cytometry. The possible signal transduction pathways involved were examined with a protein array assay and western blot analysis. RESULTS: After incubation, the cell survival rate was significantly lower after treatment with 5, 10, and 20 microM of gossypol. The maximum antisurvival effect of gossypol was observed at 20 microM, and the number of apoptotic cells was higher in the preparations cultured with 10 and 20 microM of gossypol. The results in flow cytometry indicated that at concentrations of 10 and 20 microM, gossypol increased the proportion of early- and late-apoptotic retinoblastoma cells and induced cell arrest of retinoblastoma cells at the same concentrations. This antiproliferative effect was later confirmed by upregulating the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5), caspase 8, caspase 9, caspase 3, cytochrome C, tumor protein 53 (p53), and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) in the signal transduction pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that gossypol has an antiproliferative effect on retinoblastoma cells.","['Hsiao, Wei-Ting', 'Tsai, Ming-Dar', 'Jow, Guey-Mei', 'Tien, Lu-Tai', 'Lee, Yih-Jing']","['Hsiao WT', 'Tsai MD', 'Jow GM', 'Tien LT', 'Lee YJ']","['School of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120720,United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Retinoblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/08/10 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mol Vis. 2012;18:2033-42.

There are six PML isoforms with different C-terminal regions in ND10, of which PML isoform I (PML.I) is the most abundant. Depletion of all PML isoforms increases the plaque formation efficiency of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, and reconstitution of expression of PML.I and PML.II partially reverses this improved replication. ICP0 also induces widespread degradation of SUMO-conjugated proteins during HSV-1 infection, and this activity is linked to its ability to counteract cellular intrinsic antiviral resistance. All PML isoforms are highly SUMO modified, and all such modified forms are sensitive to ICP0-mediated degradation. However, in contrast to the situation with the other isoforms, ICP0 also targets PML.I that is not modified by SUMO, and PML in general is degraded more rapidly than the bulk of other SUMO-modified proteins. We report here that ICP0 interacts with PML.I in both yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is dependent on PML.I isoform-specific sequences and the N-terminal half of ICP0 and is required for SUMO-modification-independent degradation of PML.I by ICP0. Degradation of the other PML isoforms by ICP0 was less efficient in cells specifically depleted of PML.I. Therefore, ICP0 has two distinct mechanisms of targeting PML: one dependent on SUMO modification and the other via SUMO-independent interaction with PML.I. We conclude that the ICP0-PML.I interaction reflects a countermeasure to PML-related antiviral restriction.","['Cuchet-Lourenco, Delphine', 'Vanni, Emilia', 'Glass, Mandy', 'Orr, Anne', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Cuchet-Lourenco D', 'Vanni E', 'Glass M', 'Orr A', 'Everett RD']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. delphine.cuchet@glasgow.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120808,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/08/10 06:00,2012/12/27 06:00,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01145-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01145-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Oct;86(20):11209-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01145-12.

Therefore, we studied the effect of BCR stimulation on modulating telomerase activity. The multivalent BCR ligand, dextran conjugated anti-mu mAb HB57 (HB57-dex), increased telomerase activity and promoted cell survival and proliferation preferentially in U-CLL cases, whereas the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 blocked HB57-dex induced telomerase activation. Although both U-CLL and M-CLL clones exhibited similar membrane proximal signaling responses to HB57-dex, telomerase activity and cell proliferation, when inducible in M-CLL, differed. B-CLL cells stimulated using bivalent F(ab')(2) -goat anti-mu antibody (goat anti-mu) exhibited higher membrane proximal response in U-CLL than M-CLL cells, whereas telomerase activity, cell survival, and proliferation were induced to lower levels than those induced by HB57-dex. In normal B lymphocytes, HB57-dex induced less protein phosphorylation but more cell proliferation and survival than goat anti-mu. Although both anti-BCR stimuli induced comparable telomerase activity, normal CD5(+) B cells preferentially exhibited higher hTERT positivity than their CD5(-) counterparts. These findings provide an understanding of how BCR-mediated signals impact telomerase modulation in IGHV mutation-based subgroups of B-CLL and normal B cells.","['Damle, Rajendra N', 'Temburni, Sonal', 'Banapour, Taraneh', 'Paul, Santanu', 'Mongini, Patricia K A', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Damle RN', 'Temburni S', 'Banapour T', 'Paul S', 'Mongini PK', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. rdamle@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120808,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",2012/08/10 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51693-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-409110 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Sep 20;120(12):2438-49. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-409110.

In vitro, CLL cells rapidly undergo apoptosis unless microenvironmental factors are provided that support their survival. Signaling pathways activated in the microenvironment in vivo include the B-cell receptor (BCR) and NF-kappaB pathways. Thus, CLL is a disease ""addicted to the host"" and is dependent on pathways that promote normal B-cell development, expansion, and survival; this is particularly true in the case of the BCR signaling cascade. Small-molecule inhibitors of kinases that are essential for BCR signal transduction abrogate the stimulating effects of the microenvironment on CLL cells. The orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitors fostamatinib and ibrutinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor GS-1101 have induced impressive responses in relapsed and refractory CLL patients, mostly with moderate side effects. Reductions in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are seen within weeks and are frequently accompanied by a transient rise in absolute lymphocyte count that is asymptomatic and probably the result of changes in CLL cell trafficking. This review discusses the biologic basis for kinase inhibitors as targeted therapy of CLL and summarizes the exciting early clinical experience with these agents.","['Wiestner, Adrian']",['Wiestner A'],"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. wiestnera@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20120808,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'SQ8A3S5101 (fostamatinib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aminopyridines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Morpholines', 'Oxazines/therapeutic use', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2012/08/10 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49863-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-423194 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 6;120(24):4684-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-423194.

Studies of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) indicate that the number and/or activation state may influence cancer progression in these patients. Focusing on patients with a lower risk for leukemia transformation, 18 (34.6%) of 52 patients studied displayed an altered Treg compartment compared with age-matched controls. Delineation of unique Treg subsets revealed that an increase in the absolute number of CD4(+)FOXP3(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)CD45RA(-)CD27(-) Tregs (effector memory Tregs [Treg(EM)]) was significantly associated with anemia (p = 0.046), reduced hemoglobin (p = 0.038), and blast counts >/=5% (p = 0.006).

With a median follow-up of 3.1 y (range 2.7-4.9 y) from sample acquisition, increased numbers of Treg(EM) cells proved to have independent prognostic importance in survival estimates, suggesting that enumeration of this Treg subset may be a more reliable indicator of immunological escape than FOXP3(+) T cells as a whole. Based on multivariate analyses, Treg(EM) impacted survival independently from myeloblast characteristics, cytopenias, karyotype, and comorbidities. Based on these findings, Treg(EM) cell expansion may be synonymous with human Treg activation and indicate microenvironmental changes conducive to transformation in myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Mailloux, Adam W', 'Sugimori, Chiharu', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Yang, Lili', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Paquette, Ronald', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'List, Alan F', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K']","['Mailloux AW', 'Sugimori C', 'Komrokji RS', 'Yang L', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Sekeres MA', 'Paquette R', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'List AF', 'Epling-Burnette PK']","['Immunology Department, H.

Recently published studies suggest that a targeted therapy for t(8;21) positive AML is feasible and may be coming sometime soon.","['Hatlen, Megan A', 'Wang, Lan', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Hatlen MA', 'Wang L', 'Nimer SD']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120809,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/08/10 06:00,2013/02/12 06:00,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-012-0206-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2012 Sep;6(3):248-62. doi: 10.1007/s11684-012-0206-6.

Twenty-eight patients received the construct intravenously at four dose levels (12, 18, 28 and 40 mg/m(2) per course) in a ""3+3"" study design. The dose-limiting toxicity was infusion-related allergic reaction including hypoxia and hypotension. The 28 mg/m(2) total dose was considered the maximally tolerated dose. Four patients developed a reduction in peripheral blood blasts of at least 50%. Three patients treated with the 10, 12 and 28 mg/m(2) doses showed a 38-50% reduction in bone marrow blasts. There was normalization of platelets in one patient treated with 40 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the highest blood levels achieved were 200-300 ng/mL which cleared with a half-life of approximately 20 hours. Antigenicity was low with one patient at the 12 mg/m(2) dose and one patient at the 18 mg/m(2) dose (2/23, <10%) developing antibodies to the recombinant gelonin component after 28 days. We concluded that HUM-195/rGel can be safely administered in a multi-dose cycle to patients with advanced myeloid malignancies and warrants further investigation.","['Borthakur, Gautam', 'Rosenblum, Michael G', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Daver, Naval', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Borthakur G', 'Rosenblum MG', 'Talpaz M', 'Daver N', 'Ravandi F', 'Faderl S', 'Freireich EJ', 'Kadia T', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes JE']","['Departments of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120808,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (monoclonal antibody M195)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/08/10 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/08/10 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.071092 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.071092 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Feb;98(2):217-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.071092.

To assess the prognostic relevance of IKZF1 deletions for patients treated on Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group trial ALL-BFM 2000, we screened 694 diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. Patients whose leukemic cells bore IKZF1 deletions had a lower 5-year event-free survival (0.69+/-0.05 vs. 0.85+/-0.01; P<0.0001) compared to those without, mainly due to a higher cumulative incidence of relapses (0.21+/-0.04 vs. 0.10+/-0.01; P=0.001). Although IKZF1 deletions were significantly associated with the P2RY8-CRLF2 rearrangement, their prognostic value was found to be independent from this association. Thus, IKZF1 deletion is an independent predictor of treatment outcome and a strong candidate marker for integration in future treatment stratification strategies on ALL-BFM protocols.
