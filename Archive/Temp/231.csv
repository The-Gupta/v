For all patients, insulin was administered to control their blood sugars; the maximal daily dosage of insulin dispensed was 2.1 U/kg, 0.5 U/kg, and 0.7 U/kg, respectively. Increased plasma insulin and C-peptide levels suggestive of insulin resistance were observed in Case 3. The outcome of hyperglycemia in these three patients was good.

The most abundant form of NF-kappa B is the p50/p65 heterodimer. We determined the complete genomic structure of the human gene and a partial structure of the mouse gene encoding p65. The human gene consists of ten exons and spans about 8.1 kbp of DNA. The exon-intron organization in the rel homology domain (exons 2 to 7) is conserved when compared to human and turkey c-rel, strengthening the evolutionary relationship between p65 and c-rel. The lengths of the corresponding introns 5 and 6 in the human and mouse p65 genes are not conserved. However, a surprisingly high degree of conservation of intron sequences was observed between both species. We show that the naturally occurring shorter variant of p65 (p65 delta) can be generated by alternative splicing of intron 6, not only in humans but also in mouse. In addition, the existence of another, as yet unknown splice variant of p65 is predicted.","['Deloukas, P', 'van Loon, A P']","['Deloukas P', 'van Loon AP']","['Biotechnology Section, F.

DESIGN: All donations collected by the north London blood transfusion centre between January 1991 and June 1991 were screened for antibodies to HTLV-I and HTLV-II by modified, improved Fujirebio gel particle agglutination test. Positive samples were titrated and retested as necessary. SUBJECTS: 96,720 unpaid volunteers, who gave 105,730 consecutive donations of blood and plasma. SETTING: North London blood transfusion centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Observed numbers of donors confirmed to be seropositive for HTLV by reference laboratories. RESULTS: Of 2622 (2.5%) initially reactive samples, 414 (0.4% of all samples) gave a titre of > or = 1 in 16 on the modified agglutination test. Thirty five of the 414 serum samples yielded positive results on one of two enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA (Cambridge Biotech and Abbot)), and none of these results were confirmed by either reference laboratory. Five samples yielded positive results on both ELISAs and all five of these were confirmed to contain antibodies to HTLV. One of the five contained antibodies to HTLV-II and the others antibodies to HTLV-I. Four seropositive donors were white women whose only risk factor for infection was sexual contact. The fifth (positive for antibodies to HTLV-II) was an Anglo-Caribbean man who admitted to previous misuse of intravenous drugs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of antibodies to HTLV in blood donors in north London was one in 19,344 (0.005%). Up to 100 donors a year might be identified in the United Kingdom as being infected with HTLV, although prevalence in different regions may vary considerably.","['Brennan, M', 'Runganga, J', 'Barbara, J A', 'Contreras, M', 'Tedder, R S', 'Garson, J A', 'Tuke, P W', 'Mortimer, P P', 'McAlpine, L', 'Tosswill, J H']","['Brennan M', 'Runganga J', 'Barbara JA', 'Contreras M', 'Tedder RS', 'Garson JA', 'Tuke PW', 'Mortimer PP', 'McAlpine L', 'Tosswill JH', 'et al.']",['North London Blood Transfusion Centre.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Donors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'London/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence']",1993/11/13 00:00,1993/11/13 00:01,['1993/11/13 00:00'],"['1993/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.307.6914.1235 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 Nov 13;307(6914):1235-9. doi: 10.1136/bmj.307.6914.1235.,,,['BMJ. 1994 Jan 22;308(6923):273.

Since T-cell depletion of the bone marrow graft performed to reduce the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after BMT has been associated with an increase risk of relapse, the GVL reactivity has been attributed to the T lymphocytes from the graft. Previously, we demonstrated that leukemia-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines and clones could be generated from the peripheral blood of HLA-genotypically identical siblings of patients with leukemia by stimulation of the donor cells with irradiated leukemic cells from the patients. HLA class I as well as class II restricted CTL clones could be generated that recognized the leukemic cells. Some clones recognized the leukemic cells from the patient, but not the interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated lymphocytes from the same individual. To explore the possibility of clinically using donor-derived CTL lines directed against the leukemic cells from patients who relapsed after allogeneic BMT, a pilot study was performed using eight donor-recipient combinations. In seven of eight combinations donor-derived CTL lines could be generated that showed specific lysis of the leukemic cells from the patient. In five of these cases, the CTL lines showed reactivity with the leukemic cells, but not with the IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes from the same individual. In two cases, the CTL lines were cytotoxic for the IL-2-stimulated lymphoblasts as well as the leukemic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Falkenburg, J H', 'Faber, L M', 'van den Elshout, M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Hooftman-den Otter, A', 'Smit, W M', 'Voogt, P J', 'Willemze, R']","['Falkenburg JH', 'Faber LM', 'van den Elshout M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Hooftman-den Otter A', 'Smit WM', 'Voogt PJ', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol,Journal of immunotherapy with emphasis on tumor immunology : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9418950,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-199311000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 1993 Nov;14(4):305-9. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199311000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a review and meta-analysis of these studies, primarily for leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cancer of the brain and nervous system. The magnitude and consistency of the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were evaluated for the individual and combined studies, as well as trends by intensity or frequency of exposure, by duration of exposure, and by latency (time since first exposure). Exposures to other workplace chemicals were examined as possible confounder variables. Three small studies by Hogstedt initially suggested an association between EtO and leukaemia, but in seven subsequent studies the SMRs for leukaemia have been much lower. For the combined studies the SMR = 1.06 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.73-1.48). There was a slight suggestion of a trend by duration of exposure (p = 0.19) and a suggested increase with longer latency (p = 0.07), but there was no overall trend in risk of leukaemia by intensity or frequency of exposure; nor did a cumulative exposure analysis in the largest study indicate a quantitative association. There was also an indication that in two studies with increased risks the workers had been exposed to other potential carcinogens. For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma there was a suggestive risk overall (SMR = 1.35, 95% CI 0.93-1.90). Breakdowns by exposure intensity or frequency, exposure duration, or latency did not indicate an association, but a positive trend by cumulative exposure (p = 0.05) was seen in the largest study. There was a suggested increase in the overall SMR for stomach cancer (SMR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.98-1.65 (CI 0.73-2.26 when heterogeneity among the risk estimates was taken into account)), but analyses by intensity or duration of exposure or cumulative exposure did not support a causal association for stomach cancer. The overall SMRs and exposure-response analyses did not indicate a risk from EtO for pancreatic cancer (SMR = 0.98), brain and nervous system cancer (SMR = 0.89), or total cancer (SMR = 0.94). Although the current data do not provide consistent and convincing evidence that EtO causes leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the issues are not resolved and await further studies of exposed populations.","['Shore, R E', 'Gardner, M J', 'Pannett, B']","['Shore RE', 'Gardner MJ', 'Pannett B']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,['JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)'],IM,"['Ethylene Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Research Design', 'Sex Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemically induced']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.50.11.971 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1993 Nov;50(11):971-97. doi: 10.1136/oem.50.11.971.,,,,PMC1035533,,"['CA13343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES00260/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The cohort consisted of all self employed butchers (n = 552) and pork butchers (n = 310) born since 1880 who set up a shop in the canton of Geneva from 1901 to 1969, and of their wives (n = 887). The study group was followed up from 1901 to 1990 for general mortality, from 1942 to 1990 for cause specific mortality, and from 1970 to 1989 for incidence of cancer. There was no trace of 45 men (5%) and 52 women (6%). Compared with the general population of the canton of Geneva, butchers and pork butchers experienced a significant increase, taking into account 15 years of latency, in mortality from all causes (observed deaths (Obs) 540, expected deaths (Exp) 445.5, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 121, 90% confidence interval (90% Cl) 113-130). There were significant excesses in incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer, cancer of the prostate, and all malignant neoplasms, and in incidence of cancer of the liver. The risk of lung cancer was significantly increased among pork butchers (SMR 176, 90% Cl 114-262; standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 231, 90% Cl 137-368) but not among butchers (SMR 92, 90% Cl 59-138; SIR 113, 90% Cl 67-179). There was also a significant increase in mortality from cancer of the larynx among butchers. For non-malignant causes of death significant excesses were found among all men for ischaemic heart disease, motor vehicle accidents, and cirrhosis of the liver. Analysis of subgroups showed a cluster of deaths from leukaemia among older butchers born between 1880 and 1899 (Obs 5, Exp 0.6, p < 0.0001). Exposure of pork butchers to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during meat smoking, which was assessed in a contemporary study, might have contributed to their increased risk of lung cancer. The possible role of other factors, especially cigarette smoking, nitrosamines, and oncogenic viruses was discussed. Moreover, there was evidence from another contemporary study that butchers and pork butchers ate more animal fat, and probably more animal protein, than the average male population of Geneva. These results suggest that dietary factors could be implicated in the excesses of colorectal cancer, cancer of the prostate, and ischaemic heart disease. An increased risk for alcohol abuse might explain the excesses of liver cirrhosis, cancer of the liver, cancer of the larynx and motor vehicle accidents. Among all wives overall mortality was similar to that expected (SMR 100, 90% Cl 93-108) and there was no significant excess risk for any specific cancer nor for any non-malignant cause of death. Results for cancer of the cervix uteri, especially among subgroups, suggest an increased risk consistent with previous findings from other countries.","['Guberan, E', 'Usel, M', 'Raymond, L', 'Fioretta, G']","['Guberan E', 'Usel M', 'Raymond L', 'Fioretta G']","['Geneva Medical Inspectorate of Factories, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Marriage', '*Meat', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Swine', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.50.11.1008 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1993 Nov;50(11):1008-16. doi: 10.1136/oem.50.11.1008.,,,,PMC1035536,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One third was due to incorrect or incomplete typing of DR11 to DR16, the others to mismatches for the serologically indistinguishable subtypes of DR1, 11, 13 and 15, known to be relevant for T cell recognition.","['Tiercy, J M', 'Roosnek, E', 'Speiser, D', 'Cros, P', 'Allibert, P', 'Mach, B', 'Jeannet, M']","['Tiercy JM', 'Roosnek E', 'Speiser D', 'Cros P', 'Allibert P', 'Mach B', 'Jeannet M']","['Transplantation Immunology Unit, Hopital Cantonal of Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'HLA-D Antigens/blood', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03191.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Oct;85(2):417-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03191.x.,,,,,,,,['Br J Haematol 1994 Jan;86(1):240'],,,,,,,,,

K562 cells were pulsed with 59Fe transferrin and challenged with DFO or CP94 (100 microM IBE) for 20 or 240 min and then subjected to subcellular fractionation. At 20 min there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in both lysosomal/particulate 59Fe (75% of control) and cytosolic 59Fe ferritin (50% of control) in cells incubated with CP94, unlike cells treated with DFO where no decrease was observed. By 240 min, in addition to the above, 59Fe accumulation was significantly decreased in the nuclear, mitochondrial, and low molecular weight cytosolic fractions with CP94 (P < 0.05). With DFO a significant decrease in 59Fe in only the lysosomal/particulate and cytosolic ferritin compartments was observed at 240 min (P < 0.05). At this time, however, there was a significant accumulation of both cytosolic low molecular weight 59Fe and cytosolic DFO. The relatively rapid decrease of 59Fe within intracellular compartments seen with CP94 compared to DFO was paralleled by a significantly higher accumulation of CP94 than DFO in nuclear, lysosomal/particulate and low molecular weight cytosolic compartments at 20 min (P < 0.05). These results suggest that transferrin derived endosomal iron may be chelated by HPOs, unlike DFO, due to their faster uptake into these organelles. The more rapid access of HPOs than DFO to certain intracellular iron pools may explain the greater possibility of HPOs to inhibit proliferation of cells in vivo.","['Hoyes, K P', 'Porter, J B']","['Hoyes KP', 'Porter JB']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, University College Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Pyridones)', '115900-75-9 (1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Cytosol/metabolism', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pyridones/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03184.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Oct;85(2):393-400. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03184.x.,,,,,,['R01-HL-42800-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Patients developing myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia after IS, and patients receiving a transplant, were excluded from this analysis. Response was defined as reaching complete independence from transfusions, relapse was defined as becoming again transfusion dependent. This criteria was validated by similar figures when using other 'relapse criteria' such as drop in neutrophil or platelet counts. Of 358 patients responding to IS. 74 patients relapsed after a mean time of 778 d after treatment. The actuarial incidence of relapse is 35.2% at 14 years after IS. The risk for relapse was higher in patients responding within 120 d from IS (48%) compared to patients responding between 120 and 360 d (40%) and only 20% for slow responders (> 360 d from IS) (P < 0.00001). In multivariate analysis this factor still proved significant (P < 0.0001). The mean time between diagnosis and treatment was significantly longer in patients relapsing compared to patients who did not relapse (260 v 134 d, P = 0.037). Relapse was not predicted by the severity of the disease, age, and sex. In 39 of the 74 relapsing patients a second response could be achieved. Responses after relapse were associated in univariate analysis with early response to previous IS and early occurrence of relapse. The actuarial survival of patients not relapsing is significantly better than survival of patients relapsing (79.8% v 67.1%, P = 0.0024). However, the actuarial survival of 39 relapsing patients who responded again to IS was similar to patients not relapsing (86%) and significantly better than in 35 patients not reaching a second response after relapse (49.3%, P = 0.0015). This study indicates that relapse is a relevant problem in the treatment of aplastic anaemia, and does have an impact on overall survival. Prospective studies of immunosuppressive regimens, looking at responses, should also address this problem in the future.","['Schrezenmeier, H', 'Marin, P', 'Raghavachar, A', 'McCann, S', 'Hows, J', 'Gluckman, E', 'Nissen, C', ""van't Veer-Korthof, E T"", 'Ljungman, P', 'Hinterberger, W']","['Schrezenmeier H', 'Marin P', 'Raghavachar A', 'McCann S', 'Hows J', 'Gluckman E', 'Nissen C', ""van't Veer-Korthof ET"", 'Ljungman P', 'Hinterberger W', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine III, Ulm University, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/mortality/*therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03181.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Oct;85(2):371-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03181.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four readily available parameters, namely urea, performance status, peripheral blood blast count and presence of hepatomegaly, were identified from which a prognostic model to predict survival has been developed.

Using a monoclonal antibody-antigen capture ELISA, we analysed sera from 21 of 26 patients with autoimmune, alloimmune, or drug-induced immunological thrombocytopenia for the light chain phenotypes of their platelet antibodies. Alloantibodies and drug-dependent antibodies from four and 14 patients, respectively, were found that expressed a predominant type of light chain, suggesting that these platelet-reactive antibodies were monoclonal or oligoclonal in nature. 14 of the 26 patients were available for light chain B cell phenotyping studies. Of these 14 patients, thrombocytopenia was due to autoimmunity in two, drug-induced immunity in four, and alloimmunity in eight. We detected clonal populations of B cells in all 14 patients by flow cytometry. Although six of these latter patients possessed platelet antibodies with clonal characteristics, light chain phenotypes of antibodies in five patients were opposite to those of their B cells. Eight of these patients were further examined for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement using Southern and/or polymerase chain reaction analysis. In all eight patients we detected clonal or oligoclonal B cell populations. Only two of these patients had malignancies (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) that would be expected to have detectable clonal B cells, and thus the mechanism for clonal expansion in the other six patients did not appear to be related to an obvious neoplastic process. Prior to these studies, detection of clonal B cells in thrombocytopenic patients without known malignancies was limited to individuals with autoimmune thrombocytopenia, prompting the speculation that this particular autoimmune disorder arises from B cell dysregulation, rather than from expansion of specific autoantibody producing B cell clones. In contrast, the current studies provide evidence that clonal B cells are common to patients with any form of immunologically-mediated thrombocytopenia. Moreover, the majority of the platelet antibodies (86%) present in these disorders exhibited monoclonal characteristics in that there was an apparent restriction in light chain usage.","['Christie, D J', 'Sauro, S C', 'Fairbanks, K D', 'Kay, N E']","['Christie DJ', 'Sauro SC', 'Fairbanks KD', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/*analysis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinidine/adverse effects', 'Quinine/adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*immunology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03167.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Oct;85(2):277-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03167.x.,,,,,,['HL 44917/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

It has become clear that the PML/RAR-alpha fusion protein is expressed in most cases of APL, and this protein presumably contributes to leukaemia initiation and/or progression. PML/RAR-alpha appears to specifically block the further differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells, although the mechanism of its action is not known. It may inhibit the transcription of RAR- or PML-regulated genes, in which case expression must be restored in the presence of therapeutic RA concentrations. However, the possibility remains that PML/RAR-alpha may have a novel function. In order to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of APL, several important questions remain to be answered. These include whether PML is a transcription factor; the identification of its target genes and response elements, and the role of PML/RAR-alpha and RA in their regulation. Also whether the expression of PML/RAR-alpha in bone marrow cells (either by itself or in combination with other oncogenes) alters their tumourigenicity or differentiation potential. It is also important to determine the function(s) of PLZF and PLZF/RAR-alpha, and determine whether other APL patients with mutations involving PML or RAR-alpha (but not both) respond to therapy with all-trans-RA. Finally, it is important both for the understanding of the molecular biology of APL and its therapy, to determine the effects of other regulatory factors involved in the control of myeloid cell differentiation such as granulocyte colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on APL cells in vitro and in vivo, both at presentation and in the RA-resistant patients in relapse.","['Trayner, I D', 'Farzaneh, F']","['Trayner ID', 'Farzaneh F']","[""Molecular Medicine Unit, Rayne Institute, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(93)90469-V [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90469-v [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(14):2046-54. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90469-v.,,,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the mechanism for this transcriptional stimulation, we used nuclear protein preparations from mouse livers to perform DNase I protection analyses and identified nuclear protein binding on approximately 20 individual sequences within the regulatory regions of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of a polytropic-class endogenous provirus clone. From 3 to 144 h after treatment with CCl4, the livers of FVB/N mice were analyzed for specific nuclear protein binding to the LTR DNA. Three to nine hours after CCl4 treatment, decreased protection was seen at potential regulatory cis-elements throughout the LTR, including specific sites within the putative negative regulatory element (located 5' of the consensus enhancer sequences) and the 3' terminal portion of the polytropic class-specific enhancer-like inserted sequence element and around the CCAA(C/T) box in the promoter region. In addition, by 3-6 h after treatment, a transient increase in protection activity for the transcription initiation site occurred. The loss of cis-element protection expanded to other binding sites and became most marked by 48 h after treatment. As the regenerating liver recovered, the nuclear protein binding activities for these LTR sequences also recovered, but protection at the TATAA and transcription initiation sites remained deprotected at 144 h after treatment. Nuclear protein protection of other sites, particularly in the conserved LTR enhancer sequences, was minimally affected by CCl4 treatment. Three nuclear protein binding sites that showed rapid CCl4-induced kinetic changes were homologous to the consensus sequence for the binding of the transcription factor families MEF-2, HNF-1, and C/EBP. The complex kinetic changes in factors that may contribute to the rapid and transient induction of endogenous retroviral gene expression in the liver after CCl4 exposure are discussed.","['Hoyt, P R', 'Wang, T H', 'Henley, D C', 'Yang, D M', ""Ch'ang, L Y"", 'Yang, W K']","['Hoyt PR', 'Wang TH', 'Henley DC', 'Yang DM', ""Ch'ang LY"", 'Yang WK']","['Biology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbon Tetrachloride/*toxicity', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Proviruses/*genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics/physiology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.2940080407 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1993;8(4):245-54. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940080407.,,,,,,"['P32-CA-09336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'YO1-ES-4-0118/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 4299-4304) that these compounds, in general, exhibit selective cytotoxicity against the human colon adenocarcinoma, HCT-8, cell line, relative to mouse leukemia L1210 cells. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was applied to HCT-8 and L1210 growth inhibition assays (IC50s) of a series (44) of the pyrazoloacridine derivatives with the objective of predicting improved solid tumor selectivity. In the absence of crystallographic data, the 9-methoxy derivative (15), which is currently in clinical study, was selected as the template molecular model. Two different structural alignments were tested: an alignment of structures based on root mean square (RMS)-fitting of each structure to 15 was compared with an alternative strategy, steric and electrostatic alignment (SEAL). Somewhat better predictive cross-validation correlations (r2) were obtained with models based on RMS vis-a-vis SEAL alignment for both sets of assays. A large change in lattice spacing, e.g., 2 to 1 A, causes significant variations in the CoMFA results. A shift in the lattice of half of its spacing had a much smaller effect on the CoMFA data for a lattice of 1 A than one of 2 A. The relative contribution of steric and electrostatic fields to both models were about equal, underscoring the importance of both terms. Neither calculated log P nor HOMO and/or LUMO energies contribute to the model. Steric and electrostatic fields of the pyrazoloacridines are the sole relevant descriptors to the structure-activity (cross-validated and conventional) correlations obtained with the cytotoxic data for both the L1210 and HCT-8 cell lines. The cross-validated r2, derived from partial least-squares calculations, indicated considerable predictive capacity for growth inhibition of both the leukemia and solid-tumor data. Evidence for the predictive performance of the CoMFA-derived models is provided in the form of plots of actual vs predicted growth inhibition of L1210 and HCT-8 cells, respectively, by the pyrazoloacridines. The steric and electrostatic features of the QSAR are presented in the form of standard deviation coefficient contour maps of steric and electrostatic fields. The maps indicate that increases or decreases in steric bulk that would enhance growth inhibition of HCT-8 cells would likewise promote growth inhibition of L1210 cells. Contour maps generated to analyze the electrostatic field contributions of the pyrazoloacridines to growth inhibition provide an essentially similar set of results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Horwitz, J P', 'Massova, I', 'Wiese, T E', 'Wozniak, A J', 'Corbett, T H', 'Sebolt-Leopold, J S', 'Capps, D B', 'Leopold, W R']","['Horwitz JP', 'Massova I', 'Wiese TE', 'Wozniak AJ', 'Corbett TH', 'Sebolt-Leopold JS', 'Capps DB', 'Leopold WR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48202.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'L24XJN68OW (NSC 366140)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Electrochemistry', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/12 00:00,1993/11/12 00:01,['1993/11/12 00:00'],"['1993/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00075a004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1993 Nov 12;36(23):3511-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00075a004.,,,,,,['CA 46560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that two mechanisms of inactivation are involved in c-myc repression: a block of the elongation of RNA polymerase followed by transcriptional inactivation mediated through promoter sequences. In this study DMS in vivo footprinting was performed on the P2 promoter region of c-myc in differentiated and undifferentiated HL60 cells. A differentiation-specific footprint was observed at G residues immediately upstream of the TATA box. This observation occurred only in cells differentiated for 48 hours or more and hence is likely to be involved in the repression of c-myc by promoter inactivation.,"['Bryans, M', 'Lang, J C', 'Wilkie, N M']","['Bryans M', 'Lang JC', 'Wilkie NM']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1248 James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/biosynthesis', 'TATA Box', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/30 00:00,1993/12/30 00:01,['1993/12/30 00:00'],"['1993/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(83)72627-6 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.2627 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Dec 30;197(3):1363-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.2627.,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abuse of androgenic steroids has been associated with thrombotic cardiovascular diseases. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a megakaryocyte-like cell line, express functional TxA2/prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) receptors with characteristics similar to those seen in platelets. This study characterized testosterone regulation of HEL cell TxA2/PGH2 receptors. TxA2/PGH2 receptor affinity (Kd) and density (Bmax) were determined via equilibrium binding experiments using the radiolabeled TxA2 mimetic (1S-[1 alpha,2 beta(5Z),3 alpha(1E,3R*),4 alpha])-7-(3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4'- iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl)-5-he ptenoic acid (125I-labeled BOP). Testosterone (200 nM) but not estradiol increased Bmax from 108 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein to 157 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein (n = 7 experiments; P < 0.01) without any significant change in Kd. Testosterone had no significant effect on alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density. The maximum increase in intracellular free calcium induced by the TxA2 agonists I-BOP or U-46619 was significantly (P < 0.005) greater in testosterone-treated cells compared with controls. Hydroxyflutamide (1 microM), an androgen-receptor antagonist, completely blocked the effect of testosterone (P < 0.01). Dihydrotestosterone, the active metabolite of testosterone, also increased Bmax in a concentration-dependent manner and was more potent than testosterone. The effect of testosterone to increase Bmax was significantly (P < 0.01) inhibited by coincubation with cycloheximide (0.1 microgram/ml) or actinomycin D (10 ng/ml). These results indicate that androgenic steroids regulate the expression of functional TxA2/PGH2 receptors in HEL cells. These findings may have relevance to cardiovascular disease.","['Matsuda, K', 'Mathur, R S', 'Duzic, E', 'Halushka, P V']","['Matsuda K', 'Mathur RS', 'Duzic E', 'Halushka PV']","['Department of Pharmacology and Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Azasteroids)', '0 (Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic)', '0 (Prostaglandins H)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', '08J2K08A3Y (Dihydrotestosterone)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '42935-17-1 (Prostaglandin H2)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', '76898-47-0 (15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid)', '89631-79-8 (17-N,N-diisopropylcarbamoyl-4-azaandrostan-3-one)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid', '5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors', 'Azasteroids/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dihydrotestosterone/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin H2', 'Prostaglandins H/metabolism', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Thromboxane/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2', 'Testosterone/*pharmacology', 'Thromboxane A2/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/pharmacology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpendo.1993.265.6.E928 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1993 Dec;265(6 Pt 1):E928-34. doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.1993.265.6.E928.,,,,,,['HL-36838/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

For leukemia, the combined excess relative risk estimate was negative (-1.0 per Sv), and confidence limits excluded risks that were more than slightly larger than those forming the basis of ICRP recommendations. For all cancer except leukemia, the excess relative risk estimate was 0.0 per Sv, but confidence limits indicated consistency with estimates several times those forming the basis of ICRP recommendations. Of 24 cancer types tested, 12 showed positive correlations with radiation dose and 12 showed negative correlations, as would be expected by chance fluctuation. Cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the larynx, and Hodgkin's disease showed statistically significant correlations with radiation dose (P < 0.05), but these correlations were interpreted as likely to have resulted from bias or chance fluctuation. Evidence of an increase in the excess relative risk with increasing age at risk was found for all cancer in both Hanford and ORNL, and both populations showed significant correlations of all cancer with radiation dose among those 75 years and older. Although this age effect may have resulted from bias in the data, its presence suggests that risk estimates based on nuclear worker data be interpreted cautiously.","['Gilbert, E S', 'Cragle, D L', 'Wiggs, L D']","['Gilbert ES', 'Cragle DL', 'Wiggs LD']","['Epidemiology and Biometry Department, Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'New Mexico', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Risk', 'Tennessee', 'Washington']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1993 Dec;136(3):408-21.,,,['Radiat Res. 1995 Jan;141(1):124-6.

Parents and children were asked to create drawings using a projective drawing technique called Kinetic Family Drawings (KFDs), then these drawings were compared with norms on the following quantitative measures: Schedule of Recent Experiences, Life Events Scale for Adolescents and Life Events Scale for Children, Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and the Family Environment Scale. Results supported a need to evaluate each family member's individual responses to childhood cancer, given the importance of the family as a social environment for children. Results revealed an informative and, at times, varied profile across instruments and family members in the areas of adjustment, life stresses, self-esteem, marital satisfaction, and views of the family environment.

An exploratory case-control study was conducted on parents of children less than 15 yr of age with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Data were obtained on 147 identified cases by interview from their mothers and by mail questionnaire from their fathers. Hospital control cases were matched by sex and age, while population control cases were matched by place of residence, and sex. The following results were obtained. 1) As for the occupation of the parents, more fathers of the cases were engaged in occupations related to agriculture, medicine, and science than those of the controls, and more mothers of the cases were engaged in agriculture than those of the controls. 2) No significant relation could be demonstrated between ALL and occupations related to hydrocarbon and ionizing radiation. 3) The results of multivariate analysis showed that in comparison with the hospital control cases the preconceptual exposure to chemicals and the prenatal exposure to pesticides of the fathers and the prenatal exposure to benzine and spray pesticides of the mothers were risks of high significance. In comparison with population control cases, the prenatal exposure of benzine and exposure to paints of the mothers prior to disease onset were risks of high significance.

The in vivo effect of CNDAC on M5076 mouse reticulum cell sarcoma was very strong; 99% tumor volume inhibition on day 20 was achieved when it was administrated orally on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day, while 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) and 5-FU caused only 50% inhibition at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day and 28% inhibition at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day, respectively, on the same schedule. These results indicated that CNDAC may have potential as a new antineoplastic agent with a broad antitumor spectrum.","['Azuma, A', 'Nakajima, Y', 'Nishizono, N', 'Minakawa, N', 'Suzuki, M', 'Hanaoka, K', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Tanaka, M', 'Sasaki, T', 'Matsuda, A']","['Azuma A', 'Nakajima Y', 'Nishizono N', 'Minakawa N', 'Suzuki M', 'Hanaoka K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Tanaka M', 'Sasaki T', 'Matsuda A']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""134665-72-8 (2'-cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine)"", '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uracil/analogs & derivatives']",1993/12/24 00:00,1993/12/24 00:01,['1993/12/24 00:00'],"['1993/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00078a006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1993 Dec 24;36(26):4183-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00078a006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The side-chain precursors, N-(4-amino- and 4-(methylamino)-1-naphthoyl)-L-glutamic acid diethyl esters, were synthesized, and the 2,4-diamino-substituted heterocyclic groups were attached using several methods. Target compounds included naphthoyl analogues of aminopterin (AMT), methotrexate (MTX), 5-deazaAMT, 5-deazaMTX, 5-methyl-5-deazaAMT, 5-methyl-5-deazaMTX, and 5,8-dideazaAMT. A 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthoyl analogue of 5-deazaAMT was also prepared. None of the naphthoyl analogues showed loss in binding to DHFR compared with the corresponding antifolate bearing the benzoyl group, thus confirming the anticipated bulk tolerance. Only the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthoyl analogue displayed reduced antifolate effects. Substrate activity toward folylpolyglutamate synthetase was, however, severely compromised. The naphthoyl compounds were transported into L1210 cells 3-6 times more readily than MTX, and despite apparently low levels of intracellular polyglutamylation, each compound was found to be significantly more potent than MTX in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro in three lines (L1210, HL60, and S180). The MTX, 5-methyl-5-deazaAMT, and 5-methyl-5-deazaMTX analogues were evaluated in vivo alongside MTX against E0771 mammary adenocarcinoma in mice. All three proved more effective than MTX in retarding the tumor growth. The naphthoyl analogue of 5-deazaAMT strongly inhibited DHFR from Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, and rat liver giving IC50 (pM) values of 0.53, 2.1, and 1.6 respectively, but this compound did not inhibit in vitro growth of T. gondii, thus indicating lack of transport.","['Piper, J R', 'Johnson, C A', 'Maddry, J A', 'Malik, N D', 'McGuire, J J', 'Otter, G M', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Piper JR', 'Johnson CA', 'Maddry JA', 'Malik ND', 'McGuire JJ', 'Otter GM', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Organic Chemistry Research Department, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Alabama 35255.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Benzoates/*chemistry', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthalenes/*chemistry', 'Pneumocystis/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Toxoplasma/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/24 00:00,1993/12/24 00:01,['1993/12/24 00:00'],"['1993/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00078a004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1993 Dec 24;36(26):4161-71. doi: 10.1021/jm00078a004.,,,,,,"['NCI CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA25236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['J Med Chem 1994 Jun 24;37(13):2120'],,,,,,,,,

Half of the patients in the SF-TBI group, and 9 in the FF-TBI group had received low-dose cranial irradiation prior to TBI. In all groups a decrease in height SDS was observed. By evaluating the major factors leading to growth impairment the influence of cranial irradiation, which was demonstrable in the 1st year after TBI, could not be shown after 3 years. At this time growth was significantly more impaired in the SF group with a mean height SDS of -0.9 (+/- SD 0.9) compared to a mean height SDS -0.22 (1.02) in the FF group (P < 0.05). Measurement of segmental proportions showed a significant difference in SDS for sitting height in comparison to SDS for subischial leg length, irrespective of the TBI regimen.

IL-4 blocked LIF-induced differentiation of M1 cells when it was added to the culture medium within 10 h after LIF, but IL-4 did not block differentiation when it was added 12 h after LIF. These results indicate that IL-4 inhibited a critical intermediate step in myeloid leukemia cell differentiation. LIF markedly stimulated the expression of junB mRNA within 2 h but suppressed the expression of c-myb and c-myc after 2- and 12-h treatment, respectively. IL-4 did not significantly affect LIF-induced junB expression or suppression of c-myb expression. However, it interfered significantly with the LIF-induced suppression of c-myc gene expression. Similar results were obtained when interleukin 6 was used to induce differentiation of M1 cells. Dexamethasone and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not induce junB gene expression but suppressed the expression of c-myb and c-myc. IL-4 also interfered with dexamethasone-induced suppression of c-myc gene expression. On the other hand, IL-4 enhanced 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced down-regulation of c-myc gene expression, consistent with its enhancement of differentiation.

The expression of a p53 protein reactive with PAb240 was closely associated with CD34+/HLA-DR+ cells and with cells in active cell cycle, while the p53 protein recognized by PAb1801 was mainly found in CD34+/HLA-DR- cells and in cells in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle.

In eight samples of normal bone marrow cells, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides showed no consistent changes in granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit numbers.

L5178Y/MRA-CN cells were 9.6-fold resistant to MRA-CN compared with parental cells. The resistant cell line also displayed 2-fold resistance to 3'-(4-morpholinyl)-3'-deaminoadriamycin but was not cross-resistant to Adriamycin or chlorambucil. Uptake of MRA-CN was slightly reduced in the resistant cells compared to sensitive cells, but the distribution of the drug within the cells was unchanged. DNA interstrand cross-linking by MRA-CN was not significantly different in the sensitive and resistant cell lines, but MRA-CN was slightly less effective in inhibiting both DNA and RNA synthesis in L5178Y/MRA-CN cells compared with parental cells. NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase activity was increased in L5178Y/MRA-CN cells compared to parental cells, while the activity of DT-diaphorase was decreased in the resistant cells. The levels of glutathione and glutathione S-transferase activity were increased in the resistant cells compared to sensitive cells; however, pretreatment of L5178Y/MRA-CN cells with buthionine sulfoximine to reduce the glutathione level did not reverse the resistance of these cells to MRA-CN. MRA-CN induced DNA fragmentation that was characteristic of apoptosis in both L5178Y and L5178Y/MRA-CN cells at equitoxic drug concentrations. However, apoptosis occurred more rapidly in L5178Y/MRA-CN cells compared with parental cells. Thus, MRA-CN induces apoptosis in L5178Y cells, and this effect may be important for the anti-tumor activity of this agent. In contrast, DNA interstrand cross-linking does not appear to be the primary mechanism responsible for the cytotoxicity of MRA-CN in these cells.","['Begleiter, A', 'Leith, M K', 'Johnston, J B']","['Begleiter A', 'Leith MK', 'Johnston JB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', ""88254-07-3 (3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)"", 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jan 15;54(2):482-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased numbers of BP-1+ cells were seen in F1 hybrids between SL/Kh and NFS/N; thus it was apparently a dominant heritable property of SL/Kh mice. Emergence of this population was independent of expression of endogenous ecotropic virus, since they were present in BMs of the F1 hybrid to C4W (Fv-4') and were not inhibited by neonatal injection of maternal resistance factor. In the radiation chimeras SL/Kh-->BALB/c, BP-1+ cells appeared abundantly (29.0 +/- 3.8%), whereas in the reciprocal chimeras BALB/c-->SL/Kh, for fewer (5.5 +/- 2.3%) appeared.

It is important to determine the association between the biologic properties of leukemic blast progenitors and the clinical prognosis of patients with AML. METHODS: Ninety-five patients with AML and two patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis were studied. T-cell depleted mononuclear cells obtained from the peripheral blood cells were cultured in both methylcellulose and suspension cultures. In methylcellulose culture, primary blast colony formation (PE1) and secondary blast colony formation (PE2) were enumerated. The recovery of clonogenic cells was determined in suspension culture. The association between PE1, PE2, or clonogenic cell recovery in suspension and the remission induction outcome or survival duration of the patients were examined. RESULTS: PE1 was not associated with the remission induction outcome. PE2 and clonogenic cells recovered in suspension were significantly associated with the remission induction. Furthermore, the survival duration of the patients who achieved complete remission was associated significantly with the number of clonogenic cells recovered in suspension. CONCLUSIONS: PE1 reflects the terminal divisions of leukemic blast progenitors, whereas PE2 and the recovery of clonogenic cells in suspension culture are considered to reflect the self-renewal of leukemic blast progenitors. The results suggest that the self-renewal capacity of leukemic blast progenitors is predictive of not only remission induction outcome but also survival duration of patients with AML.","['Nara, N', 'Kurokawa, H', 'Tanikawa, S', 'Tomiyama, J', 'Nagata, K']","['Nara N', 'Kurokawa H', 'Tanikawa S', 'Tomiyama J', 'Nagata K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940101)73:1<92::aid-cncr2820730117>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jan 1;73(1):92-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940101)73:1<92::aid-cncr2820730117>3.0.co;2-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The objective was to determine whether a change in chemotherapy and local irradiation would prevent subsequent marrow relapse and increase the survival rate. The regimens used (modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster or modified New York) delivered acceptable therapy based on analyses of toxicity data. RESULTS: Overall survival at 5 years from the time of testicular relapse was 47%, with an event-free survival of 43%. Events have been documented in 28 of 55 evaluable children. Analysis of these patients revealed that 23 children had bone marrow relapse, 4 children had central nervous system relapse, and 1 child had testicular relapse.

Evidence for the utility of the Working Formulation of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas for Clinical Usage.,207-18,"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to compare three classification schemes used to evaluate lymph nodes (LN) obtained from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL): a modified Rappaport classification, the National Cancer Institute-Veterans Administration (NCI-VA) classification based on the relative numbers of cerebriform cells in the paracortical areas, and the Dutch classification based on the presence of cerebriform cells with large nuclei in mycosis fungoides (MF) and diffuse infiltration by cerebriform cells in Sezary syndrome. METHODS: A study set of 195 LN obtained from patients with CTCL (MF, Sezary syndrome, and nonepidermotropic T-cell lymphomas) and 14 LN from patients with benign dermatoses was reviewed independently by three groups of pathologists familiar with each classification system. RESULTS: Each classification system provided useful prognostic information. However, contrary to prior reports, no significant difference in survival was apparent in patients with uneffaced LN when classified according to the NCI-VA (LN0-2 versus LN3) or Dutch (Gr0-1 versus Gr2) ratings. In addition, all classification systems demonstrated a poor survival time associated with effaced LN. By combining results from the modified Rappaport and Dutch classifications, three prognostic groups could be identified based on cell morphology: a low-grade category with a small cell histologic subtype (median survival time, 40 months); a high-grade immunoblastic subtype (median survival time, 9 months) composed of cells with an oval nucleus containing a large, usually solitary central nucleolus; and an intermediate-grade category composed of all cases without the distinctive small cell and immunoblastic morphologies (median survival time, 26 months). CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that clearly involved LN in CTCL can be categorized on the basis of cell morphology into prognostic groups analogous to what has been proposed for the Working Formulation for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas for Clinical Usage.","['Vonderheid, E C', 'Diamond, L W', 'van Vloten, W A', 'Scheffer, E', 'Meijer, C J', 'Cashell, A W', 'Hardman, J M', 'Lai, S M', 'Hermans, J', 'Matthews, M J']","['Vonderheid EC', 'Diamond LW', 'van Vloten WA', 'Scheffer E', 'Meijer CJ', 'Cashell AW', 'Hardman JM', 'Lai SM', 'Hermans J', 'Matthews MJ']","['Division of Dermatology, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/classification/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification/*pathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/classification/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Sezary Syndrome/classification/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*pathology', 'Survival Rate']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940101)73:1<207::aid-cncr2820730136>3.0.co;2-c [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jan 1;73(1):207-18. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940101)73:1<207::aid-cncr2820730136>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Follow up study of mortality and cancer incidence. SUBJECTS: 21,358 servicemen and civilians from the United Kingdom who participated in the tests and a control group of 22,333 non-participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of deaths; standardised mortality ratios; relative risks of mortality from all causes and 27 types of cancer. RESULTS: During seven further years of follow up the numbers of deaths observed in participants were fewer than expected from national rates for all causes, all neoplasms, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma (standardised mortality ratios 0.86, 0.85, 0.57, and 0.46); death rates were lower than in controls (relative risks 0.99, 0.96, 0.57, and 0.57; 90% confidence intervals all included 1.00). In the period more than 10 years after the initial participation in tests the relative risk of death in participants compared with controls was near unity for all causes (relative risk 0.99 (0.95 to 1.04) and all neoplasms (0.95 (0.87 to 1.04)); it was raised for bladder cancer (2.69 (1.42 to 5.20)) and reduced for cancers of the mouth, tongue, and pharynx (0.45 (0.22 to 0.93)) and for lung cancer (0.85 (0.73 to 0.99)). For leukaemia mortality was equal to that expected from national rates but greater than in controls for both the whole follow up period (1.75 (1.01 to 3.06)) and the period 2-25 years after the tests (3.38 (1.45 to 8.25)). CONCLUSION: Participation in nuclear weapon tests had no detectable effect on expectation of life or on subsequent risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases. The excess of leukaemia in participants compared with controls seems to be principally due to a chance deficit in the controls, but the possibility that participation in the tests may have caused a small risk of leukaemia in the early years afterwards cannot be ruled out.","['Darby, S C', 'Kendall, G M', 'Fell, T P', 'Doll, R', 'Goodill, A A', 'Conquest, A J', 'Jackson, D A', 'Haylock, R G']","['Darby SC', 'Kendall GM', 'Fell TP', 'Doll R', 'Goodill AA', 'Conquest AJ', 'Jackson DA', 'Haylock RG']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Environmental Exposure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1993/12/11 00:00,1993/12/11 00:01,['1993/12/11 00:00'],"['1993/12/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.307.6918.1530 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 Dec 11;307(6918):1530-5. doi: 10.1136/bmj.307.6918.1530.,,,"['BMJ. 1994 Jan 29;308(6924):339; author reply 339-40.

We have cloned a region containing a breakpoint junction of 3q27 from a cell line established from a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma carrying t(3;22)(q27;q11). The region cloned was shown to contain an Ig lambda light chain gene fused to a gene on chromosome 3q27. This finding was subsequently confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Extra nucleotides were present at the joining site. The heptamer-like and nonamer-like sequences separated by an intervening 24 bp were present in the region corresponding to the breakpoint of 3q27, suggesting that a misrecombination in Ig gene rearrangement may be involved in the translocation. Southern blot analysis with a 3q27-specific probe showed rearrangements in three additional patients with B-cell malignancies with the t(3;14)(q27;q32). The breakpoints of all four cases clustered within a limited 3-kb region on chromosome 3q27. The region of 3q27 involved in the translocation was designated as the BCL5 locus. The transcripts from the BCL5 locus were detected in normal tissues and hematopoietic cell lines, and the increased expression of transcript of aberrant size was detected in the established cell line carrying t(3;22).

Although the limits of these deletions vary among patients, a region of cytogenetic overlap that includes band 5q31 is deleted consistently, suggesting loss of 5q31 loci critical for normal myeloid differentiation and leukemogenesis. An anonymous genomic DNA segment D5S89, previously mapped to 5q21-31, detects consistent loss of alleles in cases showing the 5q- chromosome at presentation or relapse. Analysis of a panel of natural-deletion somatic-cell hybrids in conjunction with irradiation hybrids containing fragments of human chromosome 5q shows that the D5S89 locus is telomeric to the interleukin (IL) genes (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) and interferon response factor-1 (IRF-1) gene and centromeric to the early response transcription factor (early growth response gene-1 [EGR-1]) on 5q31. To further define the principal region of loss, we have isolated and characterized yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) spanning D5S89. The presence of several CpG islands within the 300-kb YAC is suggestive of multiple transcription units. However, IL-4, IL-5, IRF-1, IL-3, GM-CSF, and EGR-1 genes were not detected in the YAC clone spanning D5S89, implying that none of these genes are in the vicinity of the D5S89 marker. Further characterization of these YACs should facilitate the isolation of novel candidate genes that may play a role in the evolution of the abnormal phenotype associated with 5q- chromosome.","['Nagarajan, L', 'Zavadil, J', 'Claxton, D', 'Lu, X', 'Fairman, J', 'Warrington, J A', 'Wasmuth, J J', 'Chinault, A C', 'Sever, C E', 'Slovak, M L']","['Nagarajan L', 'Zavadil J', 'Claxton D', 'Lu X', 'Fairman J', 'Warrington JA', 'Wasmuth JJ', 'Chinault AC', 'Sever CE', 'Slovak ML', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Interleukins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77295-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 1;83(1):199-208.,"['D5S89', 'EGR-1']",['GENBANK/S67780'],,,,"['CA32374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG 00320/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Additional drugs in clinical or preclinical trials offer promise for use in preventing this pneumonitis. Varicella is one of the most frequent serious viral infections in patients with cancer, especially children. Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) has proven effective in reducing the frequency of infection in exposed susceptible individuals; however, breakthrough infections are not uncommon. Of 358 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 62 received VZIG following exposure to varicella, and 16 (26%) of these had breakthrough varicella. A live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine offers promise, especially for the universal immunization of individuals before immunocompromise occurs.","['Hughes, W T']",['Hughes WT'],"[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Chickenpox/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/17.supplement_2.s368 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1993 Nov;17 Suppl 2:S368-71. doi: 10.1093/clinids/17.supplement_2.s368.,,,,,,"['ACTG 175501/CT/CIT NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 20673-10/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Until 10 years ago the microorganisms most frequently encountered were aerobic gram-negative bacilli, which in many centers were responsible for, on average, one infection per neutropenic period. Many different approaches to the prevention of these infections have been designed. Patients have been kept in strict isolation and given broad-spectrum antibiotics prophylactically. This approach has led to a decrease in the incidence of infections in these patients, but compliance and emergence of resistance have been important limiting factors. The rationale of selective decontamination with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or quinolones was that the elimination of potentially pathogenic aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the gastrointestinal tract would prevent colonization and subsequent infection. The use of these antibiotics has led to a shift in the spectrum of infections. Infections due to gram-negative bacilli have been virtually eliminated, but the number of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria is rapidly increasing; however, the latter infections are most often only minor. In some centers quinolones are now used together with agents active against these gram-positive bacteria. The approach of selective decontamination has not led to fewer febrile episodes or to a lower mortality in neutropenic patients. Future studies should be directed towards identifying the cause of febrile episodes and the epidemiology of gram-positive bacterial infections.","['Verhoef, J']",['Verhoef J'],"['Eijkman-Winkler Institute for Medical and Clinical Microbiology, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Quinolones)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Communicable Diseases/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Infection Control/trends', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Quinolones/therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/therapeutic use']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/17.supplement_2.s359 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1993 Nov;17 Suppl 2:S359-67. doi: 10.1093/clinids/17.supplement_2.s359.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a low-endotoxin in vitro system, we observed that Ox-LDL but not native LDL induced the production, by both freshly adherent human peripheral blood monocytes and human monocytic THP-1 cells, of the alpha chemokine interleukin (IL)-8, a potent chemoattractant for T lymphocytes. Marked IL-8 induction by Ox-LDL did not require IL-1 beta generation in THP-1 cells. Ox-LDL-induced chemokine production was selective, as Ox-LDL did not stimulate the production by THP-1 cells of the T-lymphocyte chemotactic beta chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha. IL-8 induction increased in proportion to the extent of oxidation of LDL as measured by the content of lipid oxidation end products. To identify potentially active components of Ox-LDL, we tested malondialdehyde, an arachidonate-derived lipid oxidation product, and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, an oxidation product of linoleate, the major polyunsaturated fatty acid in LDL, and observed that they induced IL-8 generation in the absence of Ox-LDL. Furthermore, when most free lipid oxidation products were removed from Ox-LDL by dialysis, some IL-8-inducing activity was released into the dialysate. However, the major IL-8-inducing activity was not dialyzable. To address the nature of the LDL particle modification required to induce IL-8, acetylated or malondialdehyde-treated native LDL particles were monitored for activity. Neither procedure rendered LDL capable of inducing IL-8. However, phospholipase A2-treated LDL induced THP-1 cell expression of IL-8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Terkeltaub, R', 'Banka, C L', 'Solan, J', 'Santoro, D', 'Brand, K', 'Curtiss, L K']","['Terkeltaub R', 'Banka CL', 'Solan J', 'Santoro D', 'Brand K', 'Curtiss LK']","['VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92161.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb,Arteriosclerosis and thrombosis : a journal of vascular biology,9101388,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Linoleic Acids)', '0 (Linoleic Acids, Conjugated)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '15514-85-9 (9-hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Acetylation', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Linoleic Acids/pharmacology', '*Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Malondialdehyde/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phospholipases A/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.14.1.47 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb. 1994 Jan;14(1):47-53. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.14.1.47.,,,,,,"['DK-36702/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-35297/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-50060/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although several causes of death (such as leukaemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's) may be considered, the approach is univariate because the causes of death are analysed sequentially and independently of one another. This approach is consistent with a one-cause one-effect model. Rarely, however, is the action of a carcinogen manifested at only one body site, and correlations among causes of death are the norm rather than the exception. A multiple effects model is therefore appropriate, and the multivariate nature of cancer mortality data should be exploited when exploring geographic pattern in cancer risks. This paper describes such an approach. We construct maps based on a principal components analysis of cancer mortality rates from different geographic areas. The resulting principal components are called synthetic cancer variables (SCVs), and maps of the SCV scores are synthetic risk maps (SRMs). These maps quantify geographic variation in cancer risk at several body sites simultaneously, and may be analysed for (1) spatial structure and (2) geographic association with potential risk factors. As an example, we use synthetic risk maps to determine whether high-risk counties in Illinois cluster near nuclear facilities. Much work remains to be done, but synthetic cancer risk maps appear to be a useful tool for quantifying geographic pattern and multivariate structure in cancer mortality.","['Jacquez, G M', 'Kheifets, L I']","['Jacquez GM', 'Kheifets LI']","['Applied Biomathematics, Point Roberts, WA 98281.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/adverse effects', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Illinois/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Nuclear Energy', '*Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.4780121917 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 1993 Oct;12(19-20):1931-42. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780121917.,,,,,,['2 R44 CA50800-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The prior expected number of deaths was modelled using a Poisson regression approach based on a model with main effects of district and age. Desirable properties of risk parameters for disease mapping are that they both reflect the level of risk and cope with the instability in the observed measure caused by the numbers at risk in each district. Different techniques for estimation of parameters were applied: empirical Bayes estimation (EB) using a nonparametric prior and a gamma prior, and a Bayesian approach (B) with a uniform prior. For the parametric EB also a constrained estimator was used. The EB techniques studied in this paper shift or smooth the values of the risk parameter towards a global mean. In the Bayesian method applied here, spatial dependence among districts can be modelled, that is the estimates are smoothed towards a local mean.

Some of the studied combinations related to the simultaneous surface and cytoplasmic marker expression, others, expressed mainly on cell surface membrane, represented atypical or aberrant combinations. Comparing membrane (m) and cytoplasmic (c) antigen expression (followed in 23 acute leukemia cases), we observed that CD3 could be detected in cytoplasm in the majority of T-ALL cells, while was absent on cell surface membrane where simultaneous expression of more immature T cell markers, such as CD7 and CD5, could be detected. Combination of mCD7/cCD3 could be regarded as a suitable marker of individual T-ALL cells. In cases of B-precursors of acute leukemia cells, leukemia-related combination of mCD19/cCD22 was found, which could characterize a single leukemia cell. The cells in one of 11 AML followed cases were positive for CD13 in cytoplasm, but not on cell surface membrane, where CD33 and other myeloid antigens were expressed. The cells in another two AML cases were positive for CD11 in cytoplasm but not on cell surface membrane, where CD13 or CD33 were expressed. Again, marker combinations of mCD33/cCD13 and mCD13 or mCD33/cCD11, respectively, represent a leukemia-related feature, suitable for tracing single leukemia cells in double immunofluorescence. Acute leukemia defined by the coexpression on most blast cells of antigens classically attributed to different lineages (referred as atypical/aberrant marker combinations) remains a rare event. We isolated a series of 27 (12%) such cases of 225 acute leukemia patients whose cells were immunophenotyped at diagnosis. Myeloid markers were present in T-ALL of two cases, T and B markers were coexpressed in 13 cases, markers of B and myeloid lineage were associated in one case, and T cell and myeloid antigens were found in 10 AML cases; in one AML case (M3 according to FAB classification) an aberrant nuclear coexpression of TdT was observed. In one case of the last group an interesting antigen combination of CD4/CD34 present in AML with monocytic differentiation was observed. When 5 patients with leukemia-associated (aberrant) markers were again analyzed at relapse, the relevant antigen combinations were retained in all of them. In summary, 44 of 50 cases (88%) from our acute leukemia series studied for leukemia-associated antigen combination, both with surface membrane and cytoplasmic marker combinations and those with aberrant markers coexpression allow the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Babusikova, O', 'Mesarosova, A', 'Konikova, M', 'Kusenda, J', 'Glasova, M', 'Klobusicka, M']","['Babusikova O', 'Mesarosova A', 'Konikova M', 'Kusenda J', 'Glasova M', 'Klobusicka M']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/blood', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1993;40(5):275-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth-promoting activity in the BALL-1 supernatant has been further characterized using FPLC chromatography, molecular weight (MW) sieve filtration and dialysis. The MW of the factor was less than 10 kDa. The growth-promoting activity was heat and acid stable and resistant to trypsin treatment. The factor isolated from the BALL-1 supernatant was distinct from known polypeptide growth factors with MW below 10 kDa, such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II and insulin, as determined by specific antibodies and by cell growth-promoting tests. The factor in the BALL-1 supernatant did not promote the proliferation of normal human fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes or mouse fibroblast cell line, BALB/c3T3. In addition to the BALL-1 supernatant, a similar growth-promoting activity was found in the culture supernatants from 13 of 17 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines tested. The activity in these culture supernatants promoted the growth of leukemia/lymphoma cell lines in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions. These observations suggest that the low MW cell growth-promoting activity found in the BALL-1 culture supernatant is mediated by a novel factor which may well be responsible for the clonal expansion of particular leukemic clones.","['Dao, T', 'Holan, V', 'Minowada, J']","['Dao T', 'Holan V', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc., Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*analysis/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', '*Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1993;40(5):265-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A follow-up of these children was conducted up for a median of 6 years (range 4-10) postoperatively. RESULTS: The median hospital stay after the laparotomy was 7 days. There was no postoperative mortality; one patient needed a relaparotomy. During a median follow-up of 6 years, one patient died of secondary leukaemia. All the other children were well. None of the patients developed sepsis and no Howell-Jolly bodies could be found in their blood. CONCLUSION: Partial splenectomy for pathological staging of Hodgkin's disease is a safe procedure which causes hardly any underestimation of the stage of the disease and which ensures adequate spleen function, depending on the treatment used for Hodgkin's disease.","['Hoekstra, H J', 'Tamminga, R Y', 'Timens, W']","['Hoekstra HJ', 'Tamminga RY', 'Timens W']","['Afd.

When BLV-infected cells were transfected with pBLVCAT, CAT activity was detected. BLV-uninfected cell lines, however, showed no detectable CAT activity. The plasmid DNA entrapped in liposomes was added to BLV-infected cells in culture.

In this study the efficacy of alpha-2b interferon in a regimen of induction followed by a phase of sequential maintenance to progressively decreasing doses was evaluated with the aim of knowing the minimum doses necessary to maintain response. METHODS: The response to treatment with alpha-2b interferon was prospectively studied in a group of 37 patients with chronic myeloproliferative syndromes with associated thrombocytosis (excluding chronic myeloid leukemia). Likewise, the toxicity of the treatment was analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of the patients responded (platelets lower than 600 x 10(9)/1) to the daily administration of 3 or 5 MU of interferon. Forty percent of the patients who responded to the daily schedule of administration maintained the response upon receiving 3 doses weekly for 4 months. Half of the 8 patients who received 2 weekly doses of interferon for 4 months continued maintaining the responses. Only two of the 4 patients who received one sole weekly dose during the following 4 months maintained the response. Only one of the 37 patients who initiated treatment underwent progression of the symptoms present at the beginning of the study. Toxicity was high and was the cause of 12 discontinuations of treatment (32% of the patients) during the daily treatment phase (9 patients) or during maintenance of 3 weekly doses (3 patients). No toxicity was observed in the schedule of one or two weekly doses. CONCLUSIONS: Alpha-2b interferon is effective in the treatment of thrombocytosis of the chronic myeloproliferative syndromes (excluding chronic myeloid leukemia) when administered daily and is ever less so when the doses are spaced at 3, 2 or 1 week. The toxicity of interferon treatment is high when administered at affective doses.","['Petit, J', 'Callis, M', 'Domingo Albos, A', 'Fernandez de Sevilla, A', 'Besses, C', 'Marti, J M']","['Petit J', 'Callis M', 'Domingo Albos A', 'Fernandez de Sevilla A', 'Besses C', 'Marti JM']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Ciutat Sanitaria, Universitaria de Bellvitge-Hospital Duran i Reynals L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona.""]",['spa'],['Journal Article'],Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thrombocytosis/etiology/*therapy']",1993/11/13 00:00,1993/11/13 00:01,['1993/11/13 00:00'],"['1993/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1993 Nov 13;101(16):601-3.,,,,,,,,,Interferon alfa-2b en el tratamiento de la trombocitosis asociada a sindromes mieloproliferativos cronicos no leucemicos.,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children (age 1 to 15 years) with acute leukemia during maintenance chemotherapy or post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) receiving prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) with TMP/SMX received AP following prolonged neutropenia or allergy to TMP/SMX. Patients received 300 mg of AP monthly (children < 4 years received 150 mg) dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water over 20 to 30 minutes. RESULTS: Over a 3-year period, 358 courses of AP were administered over 10,124 observable days. AP was adequately tolerated on a monthly basis for prophylaxis against PCP in 22 children with acute leukemia. AP was demonstrated to be effective in preventing PCP. There were minimal side effects observed during this trial. The majority of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 12 of 14 [86%]) undergoing maintenance chemotherapy were able to resume full-dose therapy. CONCLUSION: AP in children is well tolerated and shows high efficacy for PCP prophylaxis in children with leukemia. We conclude that AP should be considered as second-line PCP prophylactic therapy for children with acute leukemia in instances in which TMP/SMX cannot be tolerated. Phase III trials are required to determine its effect on dose intensification and event-free survival.","['Weinthal, J', 'Frost, J D', 'Briones, G', 'Cairo, M S']","['Weinthal J', 'Frost JD', 'Briones G', 'Cairo MS']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Orange County, CA 92668.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aerosols)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '673LC5J4LQ (Pentamidine)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Adolescent', 'Aerosols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Pentamidine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/adverse effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.1.136 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Jan;12(1):136-40. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.1.136.,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1994 Jul;12(7):1522-3.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1979 to 1983, 508 patients were entered onto this study and 490 were treated. After induction, patients with an HLA mixed leukocyte culture (MLC)-compatible sibling underwent bone marrow transplantation. Patients not eligible for bone marrow transplantation were eligible for randomization to two chemotherapy maintenance regimens. All patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation (TBI). Methotrexate was used to prevent or modify graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-one patients achieved bone marrow remission (78%). Eighty-nine patients had an HLA/MLC-compatible sibling donor and were eligible for bone marrow transplantation, and 252 had no match. Comparison of survival estimates for patients eligible for transplantation versus not eligible at 3 years (52% v 41%), 5 years (50% v 36%), and 8 years (47% v 34%) showed a significant difference in favor of bone marrow transplantation (P < .05). Disease-free survival (DFS) demonstrated similar results. Application of a cure model to the results showed a better outcome for those eligible for transplantation (P = .04). Patients randomized between the two chemotherapy regimens did not show any significant difference between those treated with a continuous maintenance versus a cyclic regimen (P = .16). CONCLUSION: Children and young adults who successfully achieved a remission with multiple-agent chemotherapy who had an HLA/MLC-compatible donor and were thus eligible for an allogeneic bone marrow transplant had better survival than those not eligible for transplantation.","['Nesbit, M E Jr', 'Buckley, J D', 'Feig, S A', 'Anderson, J R', 'Lampkin, B', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Kim, T H', 'Piomelli, S', 'Kersey, J H', 'Coccia, P F']","['Nesbit ME Jr', 'Buckley JD', 'Feig SA', 'Anderson JR', 'Lampkin B', 'Bernstein ID', 'Kim TH', 'Piomelli S', 'Kersey JH', 'Coccia PF', 'et al.']","['University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.1.127 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Jan;12(1):127-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.1.127.,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1994 Aug;12(8):1737.

We studied here the effects of IL-10 on the proliferation and survival of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. IL-10 was found to inhibit 54-96% of the spontaneous tritiated thymidine incorporation observed in 3 of 12 B-CLL samples. Furthermore, IL-10 decreased the viable cell recovery of all five B-CLL samples tested, irrespective of whether cells were spontaneously synthesizing DNA or not. After 1 wk, B-CLL populations cultured with IL-10 were lost while those cultured without IL-10 survived. Flow cytometric analysis, DNA gel electrophoresis, and Giemsa staining all revealed that IL-10 induced B-CLL cells to die from apoptosis. This IL-10-mediated apoptosis was dose dependent and specific as it could be inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibody. B-CLL cells undergoing apoptosis in response to IL-10 showed decreased Bcl-2 protein levels. Addition of IL-2, IL-4, interferon gamma, and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody prevented the IL-10-mediated apoptosis of B-CLL cells. None of the malignant B cell populations obtained from eight non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and three hairy cell leukemias underwent apoptosis after IL-10 treatment, thus suggesting that the apoptotic effect of IL-10 is specific for B-CLL cells. Thus, IL-10 inhibits the DNA synthesis and most notably the survival of B-CLL cells, findings that call for considering IL-10 in the immunotherapy of chemoresistant B-CLL.","['Fluckiger, A C', 'Durand, I', 'Banchereau, J']","['Fluckiger AC', 'Durand I', 'Banchereau J']","['Laboratory for Immunological Research, Schering-Plough, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.179.1.91 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Jan 1;179(1):91-9. doi: 10.1084/jem.179.1.91.,,,,PMC2191337,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate the role of the oxidative state in cells, biochemical and ultrastructural studies were carried out on K562 and HL-60 cell cultures. Particular attention was given to the transferrin receptor, which plays an important role in cellular iron metabolism. In order to evaluate if oxidative stress influences the transferrin receptor regulation process, the free-radical inducer menadione was used. The results obtained seem to indicate that oxidative stress is capable of inducing a rapid and specific down-modulation of the membrane transferrin receptor due to a block of receptor recycling on the cell surface, without affecting ligand-binding affinity. These effects were observed in the early stages of menadione treatment and before any typical signs of subcellular damage, including surface blebbing, a well-known cytopathological marker of menadione-induced injury. The mechanisms underlying such phenomena appear to be related to cytoskeletal protein thiol group oxidation as well as to the perturbation of calcium homeostasis, both induced by menadione. It is thus hypothesized that the data reported here represent a specific example of a general mechanism by which cell surface receptor expression and recycling can be influenced by oxidative balance.","['Malorni, W', 'Iosi, F', 'Santini, M T', 'Testa, U']","['Malorni W', 'Iosi F', 'Santini MT', 'Testa U']","['Department of Ultrastructures, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '17466-45-4 (Phalloidine)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', '*Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phalloidine/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Vitamin K/*pharmacology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1993 Sep;106 ( Pt 1):309-18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that vaccination of sheep with recombinant VV vaccines containing the complete env gene appears to protect sheep against challenge infection with BLV. The evidence for this protection is based on the lack of persistence of high titres of anti-gp51 antibodies compared with unvaccinated BLV infected controls, on the enhanced CD4 proliferative responses to specific BLV gp51 synthetic peptides in the vaccinated sheep, and on the inability to detect BLV pro-virus by polymerase chain reaction in the vaccinated sheep after 4 months following challenge infection compared with continual detection in unvaccinated sheep over a 16 month trial period. It has been suggested that cell-mediated immune responses may be an important aspect of protective immunity against BLV infection and it has been reported that large tracts of amino acid sequences within the env and pol genes are highly conserved in different isolates from different countries which is of importance in designing peptide derived vaccines.","['Daniel, R C', 'Gatei, M H', 'Good, M F', 'Boyle, D B', 'Lavin, M F']","['Daniel RC', 'Gatei MH', 'Good MF', 'Boyle DB', 'Lavin MF']","['Department of Farm Animal Medicine and Production, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*immunology', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/prevention & control', 'Vaccination/veterinary', '*Vaccines, Synthetic', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics', '*Viral Vaccines']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1993.46 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1993 Oct;71 ( Pt 5):399-404. doi: 10.1038/icb.1993.46.,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed conditions for the long-term culture of both dystrophic and normal mouse muscle explants and have now successfully cultured both dystrophic and nondystrophic muscle satellite cells continuously for up to 18 months with minimal loss of stem cell phenotype and retention of the expression of muscle cell markers and the ability to fuse at high serum levels. Optimal culture conditions depend on both the age of the animal and the type of muscle explanted, but the majority of skeletal muscle explants produce large numbers of satellite cells within 4-10 days of explanting when cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with high levels of fetal calf serum (10-20%). A small proportion of explants will produce outgrowth when placed into serum-free medium and assay of the conditioned medium from these explants shows that they release large amounts of FGF-like activity(s) when compared to nonoutgrowing explants. This process can be augmented by the addition of acidic, but not basic, FGF. Cultures of both dystrophic and nondystrophic muscle grow predominantly as monomorphic rounded cells which stain positively with antibodies specific for skeletal fast muscle actin, myosin, and desmin. In the absence of substantial fibroblast cell contamination, these cells frequently form end-to-end connections and, under permissive conditions, they will fuse to form characteristic myotubes. A major difference observed between dystrophic and normal skeletal muscle explants was the reduction in fibroblast-like cell outgrowth of dystrophic explants.","['Smith, J', 'Schofield, P N']","['Smith J', 'Schofield PN']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Animal/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71013-5 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jan;210(1):86-93. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1013.,['mdx'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following exposure to 1 microM A23187, the myelogenous cell lines (HL-60, U-937, KG-1) underwent apoptosis within 3 h as determined by their morphology and DNA fragmentation assay. In contrast, T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Molt-4, Molt-3, CEM) revealed necrotic cell death after 24 h of incubation. However, an initial rise of intracellular free calcium concentrations and growth inhibition after treatment with A23187 were similar in the two cell types. We further showed that an endonuclease capable of mediating internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was constitutively expressed in the cytosol but not in the nuclei of the myelogenous cell lines, although this endonuclease was not detected in either the nuclei or the cytosol of the T-lymphoblastic cell lines. The activation of the endonuclease in myelogenous cells is calcium-independent and has an optimal pH of 7.5-9. It is inhibited by 1 mM zinc ion or 300 microM aurintricarboxylic acid. We propose that this constitutive endonuclease may be related to the susceptibility of myelogenous leukemia cell lines to apoptotic cell death.","['Matsubara, K', 'Kubota, M', 'Adachi, S', 'Kuwakado, K', 'Hirota, H', 'Wakazono, Y', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Matsubara K', 'Kubota M', 'Adachi S', 'Kuwakado K', 'Hirota H', 'Wakazono Y', 'Akiyama Y', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Necrosis/chemically induced', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71003-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jan;210(1):19-25. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing doses of PABA (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) correlated with progressively better parameters of renal activity and body wt and with lower levels of platinum in plasma and tissues in rats killed 5 days after drug administration. The formation of cisplatin-DNA adducts, the total platinum levels in kidney and testes and the DDP-induced tumor response were investigated in the presence and absence of PABA exposure in mice bearing P388 leukemic cells. Renal and testicular DNA-adducts in mice treated i.p. with 16 mg/kg DDP in normal saline were higher than those observed in mice receiving the same protocol and added PABA. Analysis of tissue platinum content demonstrated significantly lower platinum levels both in kidneys (P < 0.05) and testes (P < 0.01) of mice receiving DDP and PABA in normal saline compared to those receiving only DDP in normal saline. PABA did not affect the in vivo and in vitro antitumor activity of DDP against P388 leukemia, and there was no significant PABA-induced modification in the concentration of platinum both in the tumor cells and in DNA samples isolated from P388 leukemic cells of DDP-treated mice.

Mice are more sensitive than rats to benzene toxicity, though neither species has been shown to respond consistently with benzene-induced leukemia. Benzene biotransformation in liver to phenol, hydroquinone, catechol and/or muconaldehyde is thought to be necessary for its hematotoxicity and/or genotoxicity. Our goal is to develop a mathematical simulation model capable of describing the pathways and kinetics of benzene metabolism by rat and mouse liver microsomes and to assess the role of species metabolic differences in species sensitivity. Microsomes were incubated with 4 microM [U-14C]-benzene or 4 microM [U-14C]phenol. Metabolite production was quantified by extraction into ethyl acetate, HPLC separation and liquid scintillation spectroscopy. After 45 min, mouse liver microsomes converted 20% of the benzene to phenol, 31% to hydroquinone and 2% to catechol. Rat liver microsomes converted 23% of benzene to phenol, 8% to hydroquinone and 0.5% to catechol. Production of hydroquinone and catechol continued for 90 min for mouse liver microsomes, while production by rat liver microsomes had virtually ceased by 90 min. Muconic acid production by mouse liver microsomes was < 0.2% and < 0.04% from benzene and phenol respectively after 90 min. A quantitative simulation model was constructed to describe the in vitro metabolism of benzene, incorporating the reaction sequences: benzene-->phenol-->catechol-->trihydroxybenzene and phenol-->hydroquinone-->trihydroxybenzene. In the model, all of the reaction steps are assumed to be catalyzed by the same enzyme(s), cytochrome(s) P450, and benzene, phenol, hydroquinone and catechol in solution are all assumed to compete, through reversible binding, for the same reaction site(s) on cytochrome(s) P450. The simulation model accurately described both the benzene and phenol kinetic data, supporting this proposed mechanism. In particular, this model suggests that the observed inhibition of benzene on phenol metabolism, and of phenol on benzene metabolism, occurs through competition for a common reaction site, which can also bind catechol and hydroquinone.","['Schlosser, P M', 'Bond, J A', 'Medinsky, M A']","['Schlosser PM', 'Bond JA', 'Medinsky MA']","['Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Phenols)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism', 'Biotransformation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenol', 'Phenols/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.12.2477 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 Dec;14(12):2477-86. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.12.2477.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 20 mg/kg i.v., plasma O6-mG gave a biexponential profile with a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 24 min and a total clearance (CLT) of 23.7 ml min-1 kg-1. Higher doses (40-80 mg/kg) revealed a fluctuating third phase, probably due to enterohepatic cycling. Dose-dependent kinetics as measured by CLT and area under the plasma-concentration curve (AUC) values were also seen. Following i.p. dosing, O6-mG was completely absorbed and available to the circulation. No acute toxicity was observed in the animals, except for mild sedation, a possible side effect of the 10% ethanol used in the formulation. Studies on the cellular metabolism of highly purified [3H]-O6-mG have shown that the compound is not anabolized by a human lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM). Biochemistry studies have shown that the parent molecule is inactivating the alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), thus exerting its pharmacological effect.","['Avramis, V I', 'Chan, K K', 'Solorzano, M M', 'Chen, Z L']","['Avramis VI', 'Chan KK', 'Solorzano MM', 'Chen ZL']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles 90027.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9B710FV2AE (O-(6)-methylguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Guanine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686216 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;33(3):197-202. doi: 10.1007/BF00686216.,,,,,,['N01-CM-97620/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

About 50% of busulphan doses 1 and 16 was replaced with d8-BU. Patients were treated with phenytoin or diazepam as prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Patients who received phenytoin demonstrated significantly higher clearance (mean +/- SD, 3.32 +/- 0.99 ml min-1 kg-1), a lower area under the concentration-time curve (AUC, 5,412 +/- 1,534 ng h ml-1; corrected for dose/kilogram) and a shorter elimination half-life (3.03 +/- 0.57 h) for the last dose of d8-BU (dose 16) as compared with the first dose (2.80 +/- 0.78 ml min-1 kg-1, 6,475 +/- 2,223 ng h ml-1 and 3.94 +/- 1.10 h, respectively).

Moreover, a continuous decrease in the steady-state level of busulphan was observed in four of seven patients in the phenytoin-treated group, whereas in the diazepam group, such a decrease was seen in only one of eight patients. We conclude that phenytoin used as prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy alters busulphan pharmacokinetics and, most probably, its pharmacodynamics.

The BCNU-resistant strain was much more sensitive (collaterally) to CPA than was its sensitive counterpart. The collateral sensitivity was accompanied by a severe reduction in the activity of glutathione-related enzymes and in protein thiol (SH) and non-protein SH levels in BCNU-resistant cells. The activity of glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) was 2 times higher in the L1210/0 cells than in the L1210/BCNU cells. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was also almost 2 times more active in the sensitive cells than in the resistant strain. To develop resistance against CPA with a single treatment (60 mg/kg) per passage, the L1210/BCNU strain needed 26 passages, whereas the L1210/0 strain required significantly fewer. The resistance developed against CPA was associated with a moderate elevation of thiols in the L1210/CPA cells, whereas this elevation was approximately 3 times more pronounced in the L1210/BCNU/CPA cells. The severely reduced activity of GST in the L1210/BCNU strain was markedly increased when these cells were made resistant to CPA; the GSSG-R activity, however, remained low, suggesting an irreversible injury of this enzyme by BCNU.","['Institoris, E', 'Tretter, L', 'Gaal, D']","['Institoris E', 'Tretter L', 'Gaal D']","['National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione Reductase/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686029 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;33(1):85-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00686029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pH gradient-dependent entrapment procedure was used to encapsulate vincristine and allowed such vesicle properties to be independently varied. Free vincristine delivered i.v. at the maximum tolerated dose (2.0 mg/kg) resulted in a 27.8% increase in the life span (ILS) of mice inoculated i.p. with L1210 cells. Encapsulation of the drug in egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol vesicles did not significantly increase the antitumour efficacy of vincristine (ILS, 38.9%). In contrast, administration of vincristine entrapped in vesicles composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/cholesterol resulted in ILS values as high as 133%. This enhanced antitumour activity of the DSPC/cholesterol formulations was sensitive to the size of the liposomes; increasing the vesicle size from 100 nm to 1 micron decreased the ILS from 133.3% to 55.6% at a drug dose of 2.0 mg/kg. Decreasing the drug-to-lipid ratio from 0.1:1 to 0.05:1 (w/w) had negligible effects on the activity of liposomal vincristine; however, a further decrease in the drug-to-lipid ratio to 0.01:1 (w/w) decreased the antitumour potency at all drug doses studied. Pharmacology studies indicated that the antitumour activities of free and various liposomal forms of vincristine correlated well with the residence time of the drug in the circulation.

To assess the potential of this drug in hematologic malignancies, we studied the myelotoxicity in vitro and antitumor effect of MMDX as well as its bioactivated form (MMDX+) in a panel of 14 different human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. The tumor specificity of MMDX in CEM and K562 cells was similar to that of doxorubicin (DOX), and that of MMDX+ was slightly superior. All of the 14 cell lines were found to be more sensitive to MMDX and MMDX+ than were granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. On a molar basis, MMDX was approximately 3-100 times more active than DOX, and MMDX+ was 10-1,000 times more potent than DOX. The cytotoxic effect of MMDX and MMDX+ in two P-glycoprotein-positive MDR sublines was greatly improved in comparison with that of DOX. Whereas the response to DOX in the different leukemia and lymphoma cell lines was highly heterogeneous, the response to MMDX and MMDX+ was rather homogeneous. The novel anthracycline MMDX and its bioactivated form MMDX+ are highly active against this panel of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and demonstrate potentially greater selectivity for tumor cells in vitro as compared with normal bone marrow precursors.","['Kuhl, J S', 'Duran, G E', 'Chao, N J', 'Sikic, B I']","['Kuhl JS', 'Duran GE', 'Chao NJ', 'Sikic BI']","['Oncology Division, Standford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['108852-90-0 (methoxy-morpholinyl-doxorubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Biotransformation', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686016 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;33(1):10-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00686016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO) mRNA establishes myeloid lineage of leukemic blasts that may be too primitive to be identified as myeloblasts based on morphology, cytochemistry, or immunophenotype. A highly specific and sensitive new procedure for MPO mRNA detection has been developed using HL-60 cells. It involves a microprocedure for total cellular RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and specific amplification of target sequences in the resulting MPO cDNA, by the polymerase chain reaction. Specific primers are designed to amplify an 89-base pair (bp) sequence from the signal peptide, 179 and 318-bp sequences from the start and end, respectively, of the heavy-chain sequence, and a 255-bp sequence overlapping the proregion and light chain. The correct-size amplification products, detected electrophoretically, demonstrate MPO mRNA expression in the leukemic cells analyzed. The sensitivity of this new procedure was evaluated on serial concentrations of HL-60 cells and was found to be 10-10(4) cells depending on the MPO cDNA amplified sequence. No amplification products were obtained using peripheral blood lymphocytes as a negative cellular control. The specificity of the procedure is demonstrated by Southern blotting and hybridization with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for each of the amplified sequences.

The essential histopathological feature of HAM/TSP is a chronic progressive inflammatory process heralded by parenchymal infiltration of memory CD4 cells. The inflammation involves both the grey and white matter of the spinal cord, and progresses for more than three years after the onset of neurological symptoms, resulting in preferential degeneration of the white matter. In cases with a history of more than nine years, however, the spinal cord lesions appears degenerative rather than inflammatory. Both the inflammation and the white matter degeneration are most conspicuous in the lower thoracic cord. The lateral funiculus is always and most severely affected. Although the parenchymal tissue degeneration is not confined to any particular long tracts, symmetrical degeneration of the lateral pyramidal tract is evident in all cases. The involvement of the posterior and anterior funiculi is variable and neurons are relatively well preserved. Since evidence for HTLV-I infection in the CNS is limited to detection of proviral DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isolation of the virus from CSF cells, autoimmune nature of the disease is suspected, but is supported by ample evidence for derangements of the host immune system compatible with those of autoimmune diseases.

We describe here the precise localization of the breakpoints using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with cosmids spread over the short arm of chromosome 16 and the detection, isolation and characterization of a 14Kb EcoRI fragment containing a cluster of breakpoints. First, cosmids were mapped to intervals defined by constitutional 16p rearrangements, second, the inv(16) and t(16;16) breakpoints were mapped to one of the intervals using FISH with the mapped cosmids and third, cosmids within this interval were ordered using two color interphase FISH. An STS of the cosmid closest to the breakpoints was then used to isolate five YACs, which did span all of the 16 inv(16) breakpoints and one t(16;16) breakpoint analysed. In the DNA of one inv(16) patient we detected an additional submicroscopic deletion immediately proximal to the 16p breakpoint. Since this patient has the same phenotype, the 16p sequences proximal to the breakpoint seem non-essential to M4 Eo. This implies that the pathologic event is the juxtaposition of sequences distal to the 16p breakpoint with sequences proximal to the 16q breakpoint. While four of the five YACs showed instability of the region around the inv(16) breakpoint, DNA halo analysis allowed us to identify one YAC which was co-linear with normal genomic DNA and has yielded the actual breakpoint sequences which could be subcloned into cosmids and fosmids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dauwerse, J G', 'Wessels, J W', 'Giles, R H', 'Wiegant, J', 'van der Reijden, B A', 'Fugazza, G', 'Jumelet, E A', 'Smit, E', 'Baas, F', 'Raap, A K']","['Dauwerse JG', 'Wessels JW', 'Giles RH', 'Wiegant J', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Fugazza G', 'Jumelet EA', 'Smit E', 'Baas F', 'Raap AK', 'et al.']","['Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University, Sylvius Laboratories, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cosmids', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/2.10.1527 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1993 Oct;2(10):1527-34. doi: 10.1093/hmg/2.10.1527.,,,['Hum Mol Genet. 1993 Oct;2(10):1525-6.

As it is well known the mean values of these parameters in CLL were found significantly reduced as compared to controls. But when compared according to the five clinical stages in CLL, two main aspects were observed. (a) stage 0 of the disease differs from the other clinical stages by the significantly low mean values of the parameters characteristic of the B cell line namely EAC rosetting and the in vitro response to PPD and PWM. Stage 0 of the disease is closer to the normal values; (b) the response of the PWM-stimulated T-dependent B cells decreases gradually and significantly with the clinical course of the disease and hence with the advance of clinical stages.

The factors involved in the formation of these deposits are unknown. The existence of animal models for FAP should allow elucidation of these factors. As one approach to the development of animal models for amyloidogenesis in FAP, we have constructed recombinant retrovirus vectors, carrying the full length human cDNA for either TTR or TTR Met 30 under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) LTR element. After transfection of the packaging cell line, psi 2, viral stocks were used to infect a rat hepatoma cell line, H56, mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3, and mouse primary fibroblasts. H56 cells efficiently secreted both TTR and TTR Met 30 as assessed by immunoprecipitation and ELISA, whereas NIH3T3 fibroblasts appeared not to release these proteins under the conditions tested. Primary fibroblasts secreted the mutant protein as assessed by ELISA.

Lysis of K-562 tumour cells by the ST:FeSV-induced TM was considerably more effective in 1% than in 10% FCS.

Fractionation of a crude nuclear extract from HL-60 cells, untreated with retinoic acid, yielded antibody-revealed material with Stokes radii ranging from 3.5 nm to 6 nm. From the hydrodynamic data, a molecular mass of 52 kDa was calculated for the liganded receptor, whereas no precise value could be deduced for the unliganded receptor form, since it dissociates rapidly into the 3.5-nm form. Gel-retardation experiments showed that the 3.5-nm form of hRAR alpha bound specifically to DNA, whereas binding of the unliganded receptor form was sharply reduced. These findings suggest that the unliganded inactive receptor form dissociates upon ligand binding and acquires a ligand-dependent DNA-binding activity.","['Sablonniere, B', 'Dallery, N', 'Danze, P M', 'Hublau, P', 'Formstecher, P', 'Dautrevaux, M']","['Sablonniere B', 'Dallery N', 'Danze PM', 'Hublau P', 'Formstecher P', 'Dautrevaux M']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie Structurale, Faculte de Medecine, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water/metabolism']",1993/12/16 00:00,1993/12/16 00:01,['1993/12/16 00:00'],"['1993/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(93)90101-T [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(93)90101-t [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Dec 16;1220(1):85-93. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(93)90101-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD23+ cells, however, remained blastic and did not show any significant phenotypical and functional modifications. Following ligation of the CD23 on U937 and Amb cells by anti-CD23 mAb, these leukemic cells differentiated into mature monocyte/macrophage-like cells. CD23 ligation promoted the expression of the monocyte marker, CD14, increased the expression of the common beta chain of the LFA-1 family (CD18), and down-regulated the expression of the promonocytic marker CD33. Morphological and phenotypical changes were associated with functional modifications as CD23 ligation allowed the acquisition of the oxidative metabolism in leukemic cells as revealed by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence.

Two etoposide-resistant cell lines, K/VP.5 and K/VP.5-1, showed a 5-fold reduction in levels of topoisomerase II alpha protein compared with K562 cells. Northern analysis indicated a 2.5-fold reduction in topoisomerase II alpha mRNA in etoposide-resistant cell lines, due in part to a 1.7-fold decrease in topoisomerase II mRNA stability with no change in transcription rate. Immunoblotting assays of electrophoresed cell lysates from VP-16-treated cells revealed less drug-induced covalent topoisomerase II/DNA adducts in resistant than in sensitive cells, suggesting a functional alteration in resistant cell topoisomerase II. Recent reports of specific topoisomerase II DNA binding sites near the promoter sites of growth response genes and alterations of gene expression in cells treated with topoisomerase II inhibitory drugs led to experiments to determine if the apparent functional alterations of topoisomerase II were accompanied by changes in the regulation of these genes. Therefore, the expression of several growth response genes was compared by northern analysis in parental K562 and both VP-16-resistant cell lines. Basal levels of c-myc were comparable for all three cell lines, but levels of c-jun and c-fos were elevated 2- to 4-fold in VP-16-resistant cell lines. Increased levels of c-fos and c-jun were not a result of altered rates of transcription, as determined by nuclear run-off assays. Exposure of both sensitive and resistant cells to 200 microM VP-16 for 5 hr resulted in no further changes in topoisomerase II mRNA levels but caused an additional 2- to 3-fold elevation in the level of c-jun mRNA, indicating that altered basal levels of this gene were not due to deregulation of this gene. Acquired VP-16 resistance in K/VP.5 and K/VP.5-1 cells was accompanied by reduced levels and altered activities of DNA topoisomerase II as well as changes affecting the expression of genes important for growth and differentiation.","['Ritke, M K', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Ritke MK', 'Yalowich JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/12/03 00:00,1993/12/03 00:01,['1993/12/03 00:00'],"['1993/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90643-B [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90643-b [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Dec 3;46(11):2007-20. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90643-b.,,,,,,['CA-51657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A rapid decrease in cell number was seen after 4-hr exposure to 50-100 microM c3 Ado. The dominating mode of cell death was apoptosis as demonstrated by condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus, formation of apoptotic bodies and endonucleolytic degradation of DNA. Four hour treatment with 100 microM c3 Ado resulted in a reduction of early S-phase cells, and appearance of cells with a lower DNA and protein content than that of the G1 population. Whereas 25 and 50 microM c3 Ado only initiated apoptosis in S-phase cells, 75 and 100 microM c3 Ado also initiated apoptosis in G1- and G2 + M-phase cells, suggesting different mechanisms for cell death at different concentrations. Apoptosis initiated by 100 microM c3 Ado was completely inhibited by 1 mM ZnCl2. Addition of homocysteine thiolactone (Hcy) partly inhibited cell death by c3 Ado. Light microscopic examination of cultures treated with 100 microM c3 Ado and 1 mM Hcy showed nuclear condensation and fragmentation consistent with the first stage in apoptosis, however, only a minor formation of apoptotic bodies took place in these cultures compared to that observed in cultures treated with 100 microM c3 Ado alone. The modifying action of Hcy on c3 Ado initiated apoptosis in HL-60 cells and this suggests that c3 Ado and 3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine (c3 AdoHcy) interact with different targets during initiation and progression of cell death in this cell line.","['Endresen, P C', 'Eide, T J', 'Aarbakke, J']","['Endresen PC', 'Eide TJ', 'Aarbakke J']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homocysteine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'S Phase', 'Tubercidin/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",1993/12/03 00:00,1993/12/03 00:01,['1993/12/03 00:00'],"['1993/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90629-B [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90629-b [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Dec 3;46(11):1893-901. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90629-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study deals with the effect of artificial cationic lipids on ODN cellular uptake and degradation in cell cultures and in human serum. At the ODN levels normally used in antisense-mediated gene regulation experiments, a cationic lipid, DOTAP, enhances the rate of ODN uptake more than 25 fold, but at lower ODN levels the effect of DOTAP is absent. These findings are consistent with a mechanism of ODN internalization by receptor-mediated saturable endocytosis that is bypassed by DOTAP. ODN degradation by nucleases is markedly prevented by DOTAP both in cultured cells and in human serum. Other cationic lipids, namely DOTMA and DOGS, exhibit very similar behaviour.

Programmed cell death, determined by typical cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis, was apparent with 1.5 h following treatment with varying concentrations of (+/-)-anti-BPDE. The fraction of apoptotic cell population and corresponding DNA fragmentation indicated a minimum threshold damage (approximately 1-2 x 10(-5) adduct/base or about 1 putative lesion/human gene) necessary to elicit apoptosis. Suppression of apoptosis (60-90% inhibition of DNA fragmentation) by 3-aminobenzamide and lack of an effect by aphidicolin indicated the role of poly(ADP-ribosylation) but not of blocked DNA replication.

Particularly, the data obtained by both routes of analysis were compared quantitatively. As the most prominent result, all aberrations found by classical karyotyping were redetected by interphase cytogenetics, but additional aberrant clones could be observed among the interphase cell populations. The frequencies of the cell clones with hypersomies were in general higher in metaphase than in interphase, and, vice versa, monosomic cells were found more frequently in interphase than in metaphase. Single aberrant karyotypes in all cases were redetected as microclones of interphase cells. Interphase cytogenetics using FISH, therefore, was shown not only to be a reliable measure of the genomic heterogeneity of leukemic cell populations but, in addition, to be a valuable and informative supplement to routine leukemia cytogenetics with regard to the detection of microclones which, later on, could dominate the progression of the malignant disease.","['Gebhart, E', 'Trautmann, U', 'Reichardt, S', 'Liehr, T']","['Gebhart E', 'Trautmann U', 'Reichardt S', 'Liehr T']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA, Satellite', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mosaicism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Sep-Oct;13(5C):1857-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This difference is also seen in the long-term culture system, where control of primitive hematopoietic progenitor proliferation is mediated by interactions of these cells with marrow-derived mesenchymal cells of the fibroblast lineage. We now show that exogenous addition of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) to normal long-term cultures can reversibly and specifically block the activation of ""primitive"" (high proliferative potential), but not ""mature"" (lower proliferative potential), progenitors in the adherent layer of these cultures. Moreover, addition of MIP-1 beta after primitive-progenitor activation can prevent the subsequent return of these cells to a quiescent state a few days later as shown previously in similar experiments using antibodies to transforming growth factor beta. This suggests that the level of MIP-1 alpha (or a related MIP-1 alpha agonist) produced in LTCs, like the level of transforming growth factor beta, may be necessary, but is not on its own sufficient, to mediate the inhibitory activity of the regulatory cells in the adherent layer. Addition of MIP-1 alpha to similar long-term cultures containing normal marrow adherent layers but supporting exclusively neoplastic (CML) hematopoiesis did not block the cycling of primitive neoplastic progenitors. A defect in the responsiveness of CML cells to MIP-1 alpha (or a similarly acting chemokine) would explain their deregulated proliferative behavior in this model and, by extrapolation to the in vivo setting, suggests a molecular mechanism whereby the leukemic clone may become amplified at the stem-cell level. In addition, these findings suggest approaches to the therapy of CML, using inhibitors such as MIP-1 alpha for the protection of primitive normal cells.","['Eaves, C J', 'Cashman, J D', 'Wolpe, S D', 'Eaves, A C']","['Eaves CJ', 'Cashman JD', 'Wolpe SD', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins', 'Monokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.24.12015 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Dec 15;90(24):12015-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.24.12015.,,,,PMC48116,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several reports have suggested that sIL-6R potentiates IL-6 action, its physiological role remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of sIL-6R on osteoclast formation by IL-6, using a coculture of mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. Neither recombinant mouse IL-6 (mIL-6) nor mouse sIL-6R (smIL-6R) induced osteoclast-like multinucleated cell (MNC) formation when they were added separately. In contrast, simultaneous treatment with mIL-6 and smIL-6R strikingly induced MNC formation. These MNCs satisfied major criteria of authentic osteoclasts, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, calcitonin receptors, and pit formation on dentine slices. The MNC formation induced by mIL-6 and smIL-6R was dose-dependently inhibited by adding monoclonal anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR16-1). It is likely that osteoblasts and osteoclast progenitors are capable of transducing a signal from a complex of IL-6 and sIL-6R through gp130, even though they may have no or a very small number of IL-6Rs. Factors such as IL-11, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor, which are known to exert their functions through gp130 (the signal-transducing chain of IL-6R), also induced MNC formation in our coculture system. These results suggest that increased circulating or locally produced sIL-6R induces osteoclast formation in the presence of IL-6 mediated by a mechanism involving gp130. This may play an important physiological or pathological role in conditions associated with increased osteoclastic bone resorption.","['Tamura, T', 'Udagawa, N', 'Takahashi, N', 'Miyaura, C', 'Tanaka, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Koishihara, Y', 'Ohsugi, Y', 'Kumaki, K', 'Taga, T']","['Tamura T', 'Udagawa N', 'Takahashi N', 'Miyaura C', 'Tanaka S', 'Yamada Y', 'Koishihara Y', 'Ohsugi Y', 'Kumaki K', 'Taga T', 'et al.']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/immunology', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.24.11924 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Dec 15;90(24):11924-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.24.11924.,,,,PMC48097,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epo stimulation of these cells leads to activation of transcription and/or translation of the erythroid-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and SCL, followed by the accumulation of both alpha- and beta-globin chains. These results suggest that expression and activation of the Epo receptor regulates erythroid-specific gene expression and might play a role in determining a cell lineage in vivo and that GATA-1 and SCL may exert their effects after Epo binds to its receptor. It was further found that chimeric receptors composed of extracellular domains of Epo receptor and cytoplasmic domains of interleukin 2 or interleukin 3 receptors could also induce erythroid-specific gene expression in Ba/F3 cells. Taking these data together with previous observations, we conclude that interaction of the extracellular domains of the Epo receptor with other membrane components is essential for transmission of both the erythroid differentiation and the growth signals.","['Chiba, T', 'Nagata, Y', 'Kishi, A', 'Sakamaki, K', 'Miyajima, A', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Engel, J D', 'Todokoro, K']","['Chiba T', 'Nagata Y', 'Kishi A', 'Sakamaki K', 'Miyajima A', 'Yamamoto M', 'Engel JD', 'Todokoro K']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.24.11593 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Dec 15;90(24):11593-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.24.11593.,,,,PMC48030,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe protein purification and cloning of cDNA that encodes the second basic-leucine zipper subunit of the native NF-E2 heterodimer. This polypeptide, designated p18, is widely expressed. It displays extensive homology to the v-maf oncogene product and a human retinal-specific protein, NRL. Unusual features in the basic region shared by v-Maf, NRL, and p18 place them in a distinct subfamily of AP-1-like proteins.","['Andrews, N C', 'Kotkow, K J', 'Ney, P A', 'Erdjument-Bromage, H', 'Tempst, P', 'Orkin, S H']","['Andrews NC', 'Kotkow KJ', 'Ney PA', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Tempst P', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematoloy/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (MAFK protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mafk protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (NRL protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nrl protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-maf)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (v-Maf protein, Avian retrovirus AS42)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', '*Eye Proteins', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'MafK Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oncogene Protein v-maf', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*biosynthesis/chemistry', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.24.11488 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Dec 15;90(24):11488-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.24.11488.,['v-maf'],['GENBANK/U01036'],,PMC48009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We noted in a previous study that response to empiric therapy was related more to disease classification (solid tumors vs. leukemia) than to the regimen chosen. In the present study we based empiric monotherapy on the underlying disease in treating 240 episodes of fever and neutropenia in 145 children. Patients with leukemia or Stage III/IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (higher risk group) were treated with imipenem-cilastatin, whereas those with solid tumors or Stage I/II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (lower risk group) received ceftriaxone. The regimens were modified in 15% of lower risk and 45% of higher risk episodes. Overall successful outcomes were obtained in 93.2% of the higher risk (n = 119) and 97.5% of the lower risk (n = 121) episodes. The two groups differed significantly in duration of neutropenia, frequency of positive blood cultures and superinfection and the need for modification of the monotherapy (P < 0.05).

To identify the regions within the cytoplasmic domain of LIFR that initiate signal transduction independently of gp130, we constructed a chimeric receptor by linking the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of human LIFR. The function of the chimeric receptor protein in transcriptional activation was assessed by G-CSF-mediated stimulation of cotransfected cytokine-responsive reporter gene constructs in hepatoma and neuroblastoma cells. By using the full-length cytoplasmic domain and mutants with progressive carboxy-terminal deletions, internal deletions, or point mutations, we identified the first 150 amino acid residues of LIFR as the minimal region necessary for signaling. The signaling reaction appears to involve a cooperativity between the first 70-amino-acid region containing the two sequence motifs conserved among hematopoietin receptors (box 1 and box 2) and a critical sequence between residues 141 and 150 (box 3). Analogous analyses of the cytoplasmic domains of G-CSFR and gp130 indicated similar arrangements of functional domains in these receptor subunits and the requirement of a box 3-related motif for signaling.","['Baumann, H', 'Symes, A J', 'Comeau, M R', 'Morella, K K', 'Wang, Y', 'Friend, D', 'Ziegler, S F', 'Fink, J S', 'Gearing, D P']","['Baumann H', 'Symes AJ', 'Comeau MR', 'Morella KK', 'Wang Y', 'Friend D', 'Ziegler SF', 'Fink JS', 'Gearing DP']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Liver/metabolism', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.1.138-146.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Jan;14(1):138-46. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.1.138-146.1994.,,,,PMC358364,,['NCI CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, the differentiation of human HL-60 cells and the stimulation of neutrophil oriented migration occur at concentrations which can be actually found in normal tissues and in body fluids. In spite of its chemotactic activity, HNE fails to increase neutrophil oxidative metabolism. The action of the aldehyde on cell migration appears to be mediated by a phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C. The acceleration of phosphatidylinositol turnover induced by 10 pM 4-hydroxyoctenal, another lipid peroxidation product, is prevented by the pretreatment of neutrophils with pertussis toxin. The mechanism of action of these 4-hydroxyalkenals appears to follow pathways common to other chemoattractants, but some differences can be found too. In particular HNE seems unable to stimulate phospholipase D activity. The action of 4-hydroxyalkenals and other lipid peroxidation products on transmembrane signalling systems and on phospholipid metabolism might regulate several cell functions, such as motility, proliferation and differentiation.","['Rossi, M A', 'Di Mauro, C', 'Dianzani, M U']","['Rossi MA', 'Di Mauro C', 'Dianzani MU']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Aspects Med,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '17449-15-9 (4-hydroxy-2-octenal)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0098-2997(93)90015-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0098-2997(93)90015-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Aspects Med. 1993;14(3):273-9. doi: 10.1016/0098-2997(93)90015-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA distribution of TMD blasts, which were self-limited and not malignant, resembled that of AMKL blasts.","['Ohwada, Y', 'Eguchi, M']","['Ohwada Y', 'Eguchi M']","['Second Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Osmium Compounds)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (osmium ammine B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coloring Agents', '*DNA, Neoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Osmium Compounds', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02987778 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1993;10(3):117-24. doi: 10.1007/BF02987778.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Newborn FVB/N mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of viral suspension containing 10(6) to 10(7) infectious units/ml. The mice were observed daily for clinical signs of disease and killed at specific time points. Their nervous system tissues were collected and processed for light and electron microscopy and for immunohistochemical viral-antigen detection. RESULTS: ts1-Infected FVB/N mice developed a rapidly progressive wasting disease that culminated in hindleg paralysis or paraplegia 30 to 35 days postinoculation (pi). CONCLUSIONS: Clear evidence of CNS lesions involving the cerebellar ventricular system, the grey and white matter of the brain stem and the spinal cord were seen as early as 5 to 10 days pi. These lesions, which began as mild perivascular and paraventricular neuropil spongiform changes and cytoplasmic vacuolation of neuronal and glial cell processes, progressed in severity with time and culminated in almost complete destruction of the white and gray matter in the brain stem and the cervical and lumbar spinal cord. Viruses were detected as early as 5 to 10 days pi in the fourth ventricle choroid plexus and ventricular lumen and budding from endothelial cells within the brain stem and cerebellum. Endothelial, ependymal, microglial, astroglial, and oligodendroglial cells were positive for gp70env. Astroglial and microglial cell proliferation with microglial syncytia formation was detected only within the areas showing spongiform degeneration. Viral replication was consistently high in the capillary endothelial cells of those areas showing spongiform degeneration, whereas in the glial cells, relatively few budding viruses were present. Neurodegeneration was accompanied by demyelinization within the CNS and peripheral nervous system and by hindleg muscle degeneration and necrosis. Multiple cellular targets for ts1 viral infection and replication were detected within the nervous system. The presence of budding virus and the immunodetection of viral antigen in the choroid plexus and ependymal cells of the fourth ventricle and the central canal of the spinal cord demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid as well as blood can disseminate virus within the CNS. Pathologic and functional changes within the blood-brain barrier and glial system probably account for the neuronal necrosis and spongiform changes that result in paralysis induced by ts1 infection.","['Stoica, G', 'Illanes, O', 'Tasca, S I', 'Wong, P K']","['Stoica G', 'Illanes O', 'Tasca SI', 'Wong PK']","['Texas A & M University, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, College Station.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology', 'Brain Stem/pathology', 'Central Nervous System/microbiology/*pathology', 'Ependyma/pathology', 'Medulla Oblongata/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Nervous System Diseases/microbiology/*pathology', 'Paralysis/*microbiology/pathology', 'Peripheral Nervous System/microbiology/*pathology', 'Sciatic Nerve/pathology', 'Spinal Cord/microbiology/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1993 Dec;69(6):724-35.,,,,,,"['AI 28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments indicate that the lateral diffusion constants of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-receptor complexes on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia cells increase 2-5x following permeabilization with streptolysin O or digitonin, with little change in their mobile fractions. Swelling by hypo-osmotic treatment in water enhances lateral diffusion of IgE-receptor complexes and raises the mobile fractions to near 100%. In contrast, swelling by treatment with filipin arrests lateral diffusion, although rotational mobility remains unhindered. Lateral mobility of a fluorescent lipid analogue remains unchanged under these conditions. Crosslinking by anti-IgE antibodies redistributes the IgE-receptor complexes into large patches on untreated cells and on cells swollen by permeabilization with streptolysin O or digitonin, but not on cells swollen by treatment with filipin.

The use of these cell lines, containing widely varying amounts of glucocorticoid receptors, made it possible to evaluate the receptor-mediated contributions to the modes of action of dexamethasone in these cells. To evaluate the effects of dexamethasone without any significant contribution from experimental conditions, all the experiments were done with parallel controls. Results obtained showed: 1) significantly different levels of phosphorylethanolamine (PE) and phosphorylcholine (PC) among cell lines, suggesting significant differences in phospholipid metabolism; 2) the dexamethasone induced reduction of phosphomonoester (PE+PC), ATP, and metabolic rates probably through glucocorticoid receptor mediated mechanisms; 3) the dexamethasone induced stimulation of cellular metabolism in a process which seems to be independent of glucocorticoid receptors; and 4) the dexamethasone induced alkaline shift of intracellular pH in all the cell lines except ICR27. The reduction in PME levels seems to be an earlier step in dexamethasone-induced apoptosis than the reduction in ATP. The degree of alkaline shift was found to correlate with the number of glucocorticoid receptors present. The possible involvement of phospholipid metabolites as second messengers in dexamethasone-induced apoptosis is discussed.","['Adebodun, F', 'Post, J F']","['Adebodun F', 'Post JF']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0653.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Ethanolamines)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '78A2BX7AEU (phosphorylethanolamine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Ethanolamines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phosphorus/metabolism', 'Phosphorylcholine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041580122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Jan;158(1):180-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041580122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From January 1985 through January 1990 a consortium of national cooperative groups (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Northern California Oncology Group, Southeast Group, and Southwest Oncology Group) conducted a phase III clinical trial testing the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resectable, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. One hundred and nine patients were excluded from this study due to positive surgical margins. These patients have been followed prospectively with regards to local/regional tumor control, development of distant metastases, and survival. The postoperative treatment of these patients was not specified by the protocol but the majority of patients received postoperative radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy. These patients were compared with a matched group of patients from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group head and neck database of patients treated with definitive radiotherapy alone using a standard fractionation schema. Matching parameters included primary tumor site, T-stage, N-stage, Karnofsky performance status, and age. RESULTS: Actuarial curves are presented for local/regional control and survival. At 4 years the local/regional control rate is 44% for the positive margin patients compared to 24% for the patients from the data base (p = 0.007). However, there is no significant difference between the survival curves (p = 0.76) with respective median survivals being 18.1 months vs. 17.9 months and 4-year survivals being 29% vs. 25%. CONCLUSION: While an incomplete excision followed by postoperative therapy does not seem to improve survival compared to treatment with radiotherapy alone, it appears to yield significantly better local/regional control. This would argue for its applicability in selected palliative settings. A follow-up, Phase III trial for patients with advanced tumors may be warranted to test traditional resectability criteria.","['Laramore, G E', 'Scott, C B', 'Schuller, D E', 'Haselow, R E', 'Ervin, T J', 'Wheeler, R', 'al-Sarraf, M', 'Gahbauer, R A', 'Jacobs, J R', 'Schwade, J G']","['Laramore GE', 'Scott CB', 'Schuller DE', 'Haselow RE', 'Ervin TJ', 'Wheeler R', 'al-Sarraf M', 'Gahbauer RA', 'Jacobs JR', 'Schwade JG', 'et al.']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Age Factors', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(93)90517-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(93)90517-y [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Dec 1;27(5):1011-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(93)90517-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three hundred eight patients without CNS disease were randomized among three regimens: A--BFM chemotherapy (designed for high risk ALL patients) with 1800 cGy cranial irradiation; B--LSA2L2 chemotherapy (designed for non-Hodgkins lymphoma patients) with 1800 cGy cranial irradiation and 1500 cGy to nonabdominal bulk disease; C--Reg B without cranial irradiation. All patients received intrathecal methotrexate throughout therapy. Radiation treatment records were reviewed. RESULTS: With a minimum 52-month follow-up, Regimen B and C patients had 5-year actuarial CNS relapses of 7% and 17% (p = 0.01) and event-free survivals of 53% and 39% (p = 0.04). Patients with white blood count < 50,000/mm3 did not benefit from cranial irradiation. Regimen A patients had the same CNS relapse rate as Regimen B patients but an improved event-free survival. Regimen B and C patients with large mediastinal masses who received their assigned chest radiation had a lower event rate than those who did not (p = 0.06). Patients whose cranial fields did or did not encompass the entire meningeal surface had equivalent CNS relapse rates. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with LSA2L2 chemotherapy, a less than optimal regimen, benefited from cranial and mediastinal irradiation. Compliance with radiation volume guidelines was not essential for patients to receive the benefit of cranial irradiation.","['Cherlow, J M', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Sather, H N', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Grossman, N J', 'Kersey, J H', 'Johnstone, H S', 'Breneman, J C', 'Trigg, M E', 'Hammond, G D']","['Cherlow JM', 'Steinherz PG', 'Sather HN', 'Gaynon PS', 'Grossman NJ', 'Kersey JH', 'Johnstone HS', 'Breneman JC', 'Trigg ME', 'Hammond GD']","['Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LSA(2)L(2) protocol', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(93)90516-X [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(93)90516-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Dec 1;27(5):1001-9. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(93)90516-x.,,,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The analyses have been performed by using a sensitive and selective method based on ion-exchange normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection combined with liquid-liquid extraction for sample clean-up. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in male FVB mice receiving 12 mg/kg NVB through intravenous injection. The results have been compared to those obtained for vinblastine (VBL). The plasma pharmacokinetics of NVB can be described by a three compartment model. The elimination half-life is significantly longer and the plasma AUC values higher for NVB compared to VBL. This is reflected in tissues, where, 24 hr after drug administration, the concentration of NVB is 5 to 10-fold higher compared to VBL. Qualitatively, the tissue distribution and retention of the drugs is very similar. The drug concentrations in most tissues decline parallel with the circulating plasma levels, whereas prolonged retention is found in tissues of lymphatic and testicular origin. Deacetylation yielding deacetylnavelbine (DNVB) is the primary metabolic route for NVB. This cytotoxic metabolite accounts for a substantial part of the overall disposition of drug.

Gastric cancer mortality declined substantially. Still, these rates were among the highest registered in the world, and in 1990 stomach cancer accounted for over 85,000 deaths, being the second cause of cancer death (and the first one until 1980); further, there was some indication of a levelling of the declines in gastric-cancer rates for both sexes over most recent calendar years. Likewise, uterine-cancer mortality declined between 1965 and 1985, but there was no further decline over the last 5 years. Upward trends were registered for cancers of the intestine, of the breast and of the prostate. Mortality from these neoplasms, however, was still comparatively low by worldwide standards. Leukaemia rates were stable in both sexes. Substantial rises were observed for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx and, chiefly, lung. Even more unfavourable was lung-cancer mortality in young and middle-aged males, since the truncated rate of 121/100,000 in 1990 was higher than the values reached by countries like England and Wales or Finland even at the top of their epidemic in the 1960s, and trends in the USSR were still upwards. Thus, total cancer mortality was 176/100,000 males in 1965, declined to 170 in 1970, but increased thereafter, particularly over the last decade, to reach 203/100,000, i.e., one of the highest rates on a worldwide scale. Among females, the overall cancer mortality rate declined between 1965 and 1975, but rose thereafter to a value intermediate on a worldwide scale. These recent unfavourable trends of cancer mortality in the USSR indicate that, in the absence of adequate intervention, particularly on the tobacco-related cancer epidemic, overall cancer mortality will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.","['La Vecchia, C', 'Levi, F', 'Lucchini, F', 'Negri, E', 'Boyle, P']","['La Vecchia C', 'Levi F', 'Lucchini F', 'Negri E', 'Boyle P']","['Institut Universitaire de Medecine Sociale et Preventive, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Sex Distribution', 'USSR/epidemiology', 'World Health Organization']",1994/01/02 00:00,1994/01/02 00:01,['1994/01/02 00:00'],"['1994/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910560107 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Jan 2;56(1):31-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910560107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) was the most inhibitory among them: plating of the pseudotype of vesicular-stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing envelope antigens of HTLV-I was markedly inhibited by treatment of indicator cells with WGA just before adsorption, but not by treatment after virus adsorption. Treatment with WGA before adsorption, however, could not inhibit the plating of VSV, VSV pseudotypes of bovine leukemia virus, Moloney murine leukemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus type I.

The present chemotherapeutic regimen is the result of experience gained from carefully planned randomised cooperative studies carried out during the last two decades. In common with the experience of the West German and American groups, the best results have been in those treated with post remission intensification blocks. With current chemotherapy protocols, almost 70% of children with ALL in U.K. can be cured but there may be a medical cost of such a cure, in terms of both acute and long term toxicity. This was especially true when central nervous system (CNS) therapy with cranial irradiation was used. Therefore present regimens are examining chemotherapeutic options for CNS disease control and the efficacy of additional post remission intensification. Failure of chemotherapy is most often seen in those children with a presenting white cell count of more than 50 x 10(9)/l, very young children and/or the presence of certain chromosomal rearrangements (e.g. t4: 11, t9: 22). At present the optimum therapeutic option for such high risk patients and for the majority of those in second remission, is an allogenic bone marrow transplant if an HLA-matched sibling is available. Modern day therapy is both complicated and costly and will be beyond the resources available for most children with ALL in developing countries. A significant decrease in worldwide mortality due to ALL will only occur if either the disease can be prevented or a simpler cure devised.","['Saha, V', 'Eden, T']","['Saha V', 'Eden T']","[""Academic Department of Pediatric Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'United Kingdom']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02751430 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 1993 Jul-Aug;60(4):525-38. doi: 10.1007/BF02751430.,,,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have analysed the attachment of U937 cells to ECM proteins and the effects of treatment with TPA on this process. Non-induced U937 cells attach to fibronectin- and Matrigel-coated surfaces without TPA stimulation, but TPA further increases adherence to these substrates as measured by an enhanced binding and by the lower concentration of proteins needed in the substrate to achieve 50% of maximal cell adhesion. Attachment to type I collagen was seen only with activated U937 cells, whereas no measurable attachment to bovine serum albumin, vitronectin, and type IV collagen was detected. TPA-activated U937 cells showed a two-fold increase in the expression of the RGD-dependent integrin receptors alpha 3 and alpha 5, and a reduction in the expression of alpha 4, another fibronectin-specific receptor, whereas the common beta 1 chain was unchanged. Attachment of U937 cells to fibronectin was primarily mediated by the alpha 3 and alpha 5 integrins, as revealed by the ability of GRGDS peptides to inhibit attachment, whereas the CS-1 peptide, containing the alpha 4 binding site, was largely ineffective in blocking attachment.","['Pucillo, C E', 'Colombatti, A', 'Vitale, M', 'Salzano, S', 'Rossi, G', 'Formisano, S']","['Pucillo CE', 'Colombatti A', 'Vitale M', 'Salzano S', 'Rossi G', 'Formisano S']","['Dipartimento di Scienze e Technologie Biomediche, Universita degli Studi di Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/analysis', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1993 Oct;80(2):248-52.,,,,PMC1422182,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapidity of the protective effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 is consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of the monocytic differentiation program is sufficient to interfere with programs that lead to cell death by apoptosis.","['Xu, H M', 'Tepper, C G', 'Jones, J B', 'Fernandez, C E', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Xu HM', 'Tepper CG', 'Jones JB', 'Fernandez CE', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(83)71322-4 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1993.1322 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1993 Dec;209(2):367-74. doi: 10.1006/excr.1993.1322.,['c-bcl-2'],,,,,['R01 CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of a single copy of this motif suffices to initiate B or T cell activation. The bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is a B cell lymphotropic retrovirus which causes a non-neoplasic proliferation of B cells. The cytoplasmic domain of the BLV transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, gp30, possesses two overlapping copies of the Tyr-X-X-Leu/Ile-containing motif which could participate in the induction of B cell activation. Similarly, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contains a single copy of the Tyr-X-X-Leu/Ile-containing motif which could play a critical role in B cell transformation. To determine whether these two virus-encoded cytoplasmic domains are endowed with signalling functions, we constructed chimeric proteins by replacing the cytoplasmic tail of CD8-alpha with that of either BLV gp30 or EBV LMP2A. We show here that, once separately expressed in B or T cell lines, these chimeras are capable of triggering both calcium responses and cytokine production when cross-linked with an antibody to CD8-alpha. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated unequivocally that this signalling function may be accounted for by the Tyr-X-X-Leu/Ile motifs they contain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Beaufils, P', 'Choquet, D', 'Mamoun, R Z', 'Malissen, B']","['Beaufils P', 'Choquet D', 'Mamoun RZ', 'Malissen B']","[""Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille-Luminy, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Viral/*chemistry/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*chemistry/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*chemistry/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*chemistry/immunology']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Dec 15;12(13):5105-12.,,,,PMC413772,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assembly of purified tubulin, or tubulin plus microtubule-associated proteins, into microtubules was substoichiometrically inhibited by both compounds, which also induced a slow depolymerization of preassembled microtubules. Half inhibitory concentrations were 0.4-0.7 microM and 1.6-2.1 microM for the S and R isomers, respectively. Excess of both drugs induced polymerization of liganded tubulin into abnormal polymers similar to colchicine. The cytoplasmic microtubules of PtK2 cells were disrupted by both compounds in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was observed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and quantified by an enzyme-linked immunoassay of cytoskeletal tubulin. Half inhibitory concentrations were 6 nM S isomer, 100 nM R isomer, and 1 microM colchicine. Twenty nM S isomer or 500-700 nM R isomer gave nearly maximal effect. At these concentrations, half maximal microtubule depolymerization took place after 2 h of treatment. After drug removal, slow microtubule assembly and nearly complete reorganization of the cytoplasmic microtubules of PtK2 cells were observed (24 h). One nM S enantiomer or 25 nM R enantiomer induced mitotic arrest in 8 h in U937, HL60, and EL4 leukemias. PtK2 cells also stopped in mitosis after a 24-h incubation with 50 nM R isomer or 5 nM S isomer.

To further study this role, we determined the level of RB protein present in the mononuclear cell fraction derived from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 74 patients with CLL, by Western blotting. Compared to similarly prepared samples from the peripheral blood of normal individuals, the level of RB in CLL cells was less than normal in 42% of patients, equal to normal in 22% of patients, and in excess of normal in 36% of patients. Regardless of whether the source of the sample was blood or marrow or if the patients were untreated or previously treated, similar rates of low, normal, and elevated RB levels were observed. RB protein in the CLL patient samples was never phosphorylated. RB levels showed no correlation with the lymphocyte doubling time or with proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels. Low RB levels could arise from genetic alterations of the RB gene or altered regulation of expression. To determine which was occurring, we stimulated the cells from 27 CLL patients in culture with either phytohemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen in an attempt to induce RB expression and phosphorylation. Among patients with low levels of RB, expression was induced in 46% (6 of 13), and phosphorylation of RB was seen in 31% (4 of 13). Increased expression of phosphorylated RB was induced in 80% (4 of 5) of patients with normal levels of RB and in 78% (7 of 9) of patients with high levels of RB. This study demonstrates that absent RB expression occurs commonly in patients with CLL. Intrinsic abnormalities of the RB gene may be present in those patients with low levels of RB that could not be stimulated by mitogens, while regulatory abnormalities located in trans to the RB gene may occur in the other half. Given the importance that RB levels play in other cancers, the prognostic implication of low RB levels should be studied in CLL.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Chen, N', 'del Giglio, A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Kornblau SM', 'Chen N', 'del Giglio A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

As measured by a tumor growth inhibition assay, i.v. administration of DMP 840 to athymic nude mice at doses at or below the maximum tolerated dose resulted in curative activity against four human solid tumor xenografts, MX-1 mammary carcinoma, CX-1 and DLD-2 colon adenocarcinomas, and LX-1 lung carcinoma, producing full or incomplete regressions and/or percent tumor growth inhibition of > or = 96%. The efficacy of DMP 840 in the models was dose dependent. The activity of DMP 840 against the human tumors surpassed that demonstrated by several clinically used and investigational anticancer agents. In long-term growth delay studies, DMP 840 induced full regressions in 20 of 20 mice bearing MX-1 tumors, and tumors in one-half of these mice remained regressed for over 5 months. In addition, DMP 840 was curative against exponentially growing DLD-2 tumors staged at 500 mg and MX-1 tumors staged at 1000 mg. The bis-naphthalimide was equally efficacious when administered i.v. or i.p. but was slightly less active after oral dosing. Against both the MX-1 mammary carcinoma and the DLD-2 colon adenocarcinoma, some measure of schedule dependence was observed; the optimum schedule was daily for 9 days. Against L1210 and P388 murine leukemias, DMP 840 demonstrated little or no activity and was inactive against B16 murine melanoma. Overall, these results suggest that DMP 840 may be a human solid tumor selective cytotoxic agent.","['McRipley, R J', 'Burns-Horwitz, P E', 'Czerniak, P M', 'Diamond, R J', 'Diamond, M A', 'Miller, J L', 'Page, R J', 'Dexter, D L', 'Chen, S F', 'Sun, J H']","['McRipley RJ', 'Burns-Horwitz PE', 'Czerniak PM', 'Diamond RJ', 'Diamond MA', 'Miller JL', 'Page RJ', 'Dexter DL', 'Chen SF', 'Sun JH', 'et al.']","['DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, Glenolden Laboratory, Pennsylvania 19036.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Mesylates)', '62H4W26906 (bisnafide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mesylates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jan 1;54(1):159-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacology of this drug was studied in patients with hematological malignancies. The concentrations of stearyl-ara-CMP, ara-C (its active metabolite), and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (ara-U, its inactive metabolite) were determined by radioimmunoassay. When six patients received a single p.o. dose of the drug (500 mg/m2), stearyl-ara-CMP, ara-C, and ara-U could be detected in the plasma for at least 72 h afterwards. The plasma disappearance curve of stearyl-ara-CMP corresponded to a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption kinetics. The peak plasma level (Cmax) was 322 +/- 218 nM, and the predicted time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 6.5 +/- 4.5 h, while the elimination half-life (t1/2) was very long (32.0 +/- 8.4 h). The plasma ara-C level increased slowly to a Cmax of 26.3 +/- 12.7 nM (Tmax, 13.3 +/- 4.7 h) after stearyl-ara-CMP administration. This level was quite low compared with that achieved by low-dose s.c. ara-C therapy, but ara-C persisted longer in the plasma in the former case, and the area under the curve was similar for both regimens. For ara-U, the Cmax, Tmax, and t1/2 were 483 +/- 315 nM, 23.6 +/- 4.0 h, and 19.6 +/- 5.3 h, respectively. No stearyl-ara-CMP was detected in the urine, and only 8.0% of the administered dose was excreted as ara-C and ara-U within 72 h. The stearyl-ara-CMP concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was below the limit of detection in three patients without meningeal involvement at 6 h. During clinical use of stearyl-ara-CMP, macrocytic anemia was observed, and some patients also developed megaloblastic change of their erythroblasts, suggesting a mild and persistent cytostatic effect. In conclusion, p.o. therapy with stearyl-ara-CMP achieved prolonged maintenance of the plasma drug level. Thus, the drug released a very low dose of ara-C over a long period in plasma and tissues and had a prolonged mild antineoplastic effect in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Ueda, T', 'Kamiya, K', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Wataya, S', 'Kawai, Y', 'Tsutani, H', 'Sugiyama, M', 'Nakamura, T']","['Ueda T', 'Kamiya K', 'Urasaki Y', 'Wataya S', 'Kawai Y', 'Tsutani H', 'Sugiyama M', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', ""3I7U8R8NWC (1-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate)"", 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleotides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/metabolism']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jan 1;54(1):109-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific regions within the outer envelope proteins of other retroviruses, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus type 1, are highly immunogenic and, because of the selective pressure of the host immune system, quite variable. Mutations in the external envelope protein gene of murine retroviruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 influence cellular tropism and disease pathogenesis. By contrast, no disease-specific viral mutations have been identified in HTLV-I-infected patients. However, all isolates studied thus far have originated from leukemic cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes from patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and, therefore, may not truly reflect tissue-associated variation. The midregion of the HTLV-I gp46 external envelope glycoprotein (amino acids 190-209) induces an antibody response in 90% of infected individuals, and a hexapeptide in this region (amino acids 191-196) elicits antibodies in rabbits which inhibit syncytia formation and infection of target lymphocytes. Because of the above, we expected the neutralizing domain of the gp46 env gene of HTLV-I to possess disease or organ-associated mutations selected by the infected host's immune system. Hence, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced HTLV-I DNA directly from in vivo central nervous system, spleen, and kidney specimens, and a leukemic cell line from a patient (M. J.) with both HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma to discern the possibility of tissue- and/or disease-specific variants. In addition, we sequenced several HTLV-I isolates from different regions of the world, including Papua New Guinea, Bellona, and Liberia, and compared them to other previously published HTLV-I and related retroviral sequences. The 239-base pair sequence corresponding to amino acids 178 to 256 in gp46 displayed minor tissue-specific variation in clones derived from central nervous system tissues from patient M. J., but overall was highly conserved at both the DNA and amino acid levels. Variation was observed in this region among the other HTLV-I, simian T-cell lymphoma virus type I, and HTLV-II isolates in a pattern that was consistent with their known phylogenetic relationship.

We have examined the in vitro effects of HPR on lymphoid and myeloid malignant cell lines and found that at concentrations between 10(-5) and 3 x 10(-7) M it induces a dose-dependent growth inhibition (the peak plasma concentration in patients treated with HPR is 1 to 2 x 10(-6) M). The antiproliferative effect of HPR was, in all cell lines except K422, more potent than that induced by an equimolar dose of all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Also, this effect was irreversible on HL60 and DoHH2 cells that had been exposed to HPR (3 x 10(-6) M) for 24 h, but reversible on Raji and DHL4 exposed to the retinoid for 48 and 72 h, respectively. Time-course growth analysis showed that HPR at 3 x 10(-6) M or below induces a rapid fall of thymidine uptake and viability (> 90%), whereas between 10(-6) and 3 x 10(-7) M exhibits cytostatic effects. Interestingly, the RA-resistant HL-60R and NB306 cells, characterized by a point mutation in the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and by the loss of the pml/RAR protein, respectively, were, like the parental RA-inducible HL-60 and NB4 cell lines, fully responsive to HPR, thereby suggesting that HPR and RA could act through different receptors or pathways. DNA flow-cytofluorimetric analysis revealed that HPR does not block cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle but triggers programmed cell death or apoptosis. This phenomenon was evidenced both by the visualization, on gel electrophoresis, of fragmented DNA, and by the ""in cell"" enzymatic labeling of DNA breaks with fluorescent dUTP. With the latter method, apoptotic cells become detectable by 6 h following exposure to 3 x 10(-6) M HPR. Ultrastructural examination of HPR-treated samples showed cells with chromatin compaction and cytoplasm condensation, characteristic of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that HPR suppresses malignant cell growth and induces apoptosis at pharmacologically relevant doses. The differential responsiveness by a number of cell lines, especially HL-60R and NB306, to HPR and RA indicates that these compounds may act through different receptors. The clinical use of HPR, particularly in retinoic acid-unresponsive acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, is suggested.","['Delia, D', 'Aiello, A', 'Lombardi, L', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Grignani, F', 'Grignani, F', 'Formelli, F', 'Menard, S', 'Costa, A', 'Veronesi, U']","['Delia D', 'Aiello A', 'Lombardi L', 'Pelicci PG', 'Grignani F', 'Grignani F', 'Formelli F', 'Menard S', 'Costa A', 'Veronesi U', 'et al.']","['Division of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 15;53(24):6036-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intoplicine was found to be a dual topoisomerase I and II inhibitor, with DNA sites of enzyme inhibition being different for these two enzymes. In this study, 22 analogues of intoplicine were evaluated for their effects on topoisomerase I- and II-mediated DNA cleavage reactions by using enzymes purified from calf thymus.

These results suggest that dual topoisomerase I and II inhibition is critical for the antitumor activity of this new series of antitumor compounds.","['Riou, J F', 'Fosse, P', 'Nguyen, C H', 'Larsen, A K', 'Bissery, M C', 'Grondard, L', 'Saucier, J M', 'Bisagni, E', 'Lavelle, F']","['Riou JF', 'Fosse P', 'Nguyen CH', 'Larsen AK', 'Bissery MC', 'Grondard L', 'Saucier JM', 'Bisagni E', 'Lavelle F']","['Rhone-Poulenc Rorer S.A., Departement Biologie, Vitry-sur-Seine Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FB2CIN6HMI (intoplicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 15;53(24):5987-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The teniposide-resistant sublines have been termed ""at-MDR"" for altered topo II-associated multidrug resistance. These topo II inhibitors differ from the ""classic"" inhibitors such as teniposide in that they do not stabilize DNA-topo II complexes. In this study, we found that our at-MDR cell lines express little or no cross-resistance to these ""non-classic"" topo II inhibitors. Merbarone and SN22995 inhibited VM-26-mediated DNA-topo II complexes in CEM cells only when they were added before VM-26. Since they did not deplete topo II protein, it suggested that these drugs may inhibit topo II activity before the enzyme binds to DNA, thereby preventing stabilization of VM-26-mediated topo II-DNA complexes. Continuous exposure of CEM cells to merbarone, SN22995, or VM-26 caused G2 arrest, as determined by flow cytometry. Likewise, at-MDR cells continuously treated with VM-26 also arrested in G2. By contrast, treatment of at-MDR cells with either merbarone or SN22995 produced a qualitatively different pattern; the at-MDR cells first accumulated in G2 but then escaped the G2 block and proceeded into mitosis with elongated and intertwined chromosomes but failed to divide. Their DNA was re-replicated, however, and the cells eventually accumulated at the 8N DNA stage. Given that both wild-type and mutant topo II alpha alleles are expressed in the at-MDR cells (B. Y. Bugg, M. K. Danks, W. T. Beck, and D. P. Suttle. Expression of a mutant DNA topoisomerase II in CCRF-CEM human leukemic cells selected for resistance to teniposide. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7654-7658, 1991), we hypothesize that drugs such as merbarone may inhibit the activity of wild-type topo II alpha, allowing the aberrant activity of the mutant enzyme to be revealed during chromosome condensation and sister chromatid segregation.","['Chen, M', 'Beck, W T']","['Chen M', 'Beck WT']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chromosomes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Thiobarbiturates/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/ultrastructure']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 15;53(24):5946-53.,,,,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

M. Deffie, J. K. Batra, and G. J. Goldenberg, Cancer Res., 49: 58-62, 1989) may be due to an allelic mutation in the topo II alpha gene (A. M. Deffie, D. J. Bosman, and G. J. Goldenberg, Cancer Res., 49: 6879-6882, 1989). The drug-resistant cell lines P388/ADR/3 and P388/ADR/7 express a shortened topo II alpha mRNA transcript in addition to the native transcript present in the drug-sensitive P388/4 cell line. Using complementary DNA probes derived from the coding sequence and 3' untranslated region of the native mouse topo II alpha transcript, we have determined that the shorter 4.5-kilobase topo II alpha transcript expressed in the drug-resistant cell lines contains only 3.5-kilobases of topo II sequence from the 5'-terminus onwards. Using a 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy, we have cloned cDNAs representing the 3'-termini of both the native and mutant transcripts from both P388/ADR/3 and P388/ADR/7 cells. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the shorter 4.5-kilobase transcript: (a) encodes topoisomerase II alpha until nucleotide position 3494, at which point the sequence diverges for the remaining 956 bases; (b) contains a polyadenylation signal distinct from the native transcript; and (c) contains an open reading frame predicting a truncated topo II alpha fusion protein. Of great interest was the finding that the non-topo II alpha 956-base sequence in the shorter transcript encodes the promoter, exon I, and part of the first intron of the murine retinoic acid receptor alpha gene locus in the antisense orientation, suggesting that a rearrangement on chromosome 11 in the drug-resistant cells led to a gene fusion event between the loci encoding topo II alpha and retinoic acid receptor alpha.","['McPherson, J P', 'Brown, G A', 'Goldenberg, G J']","['McPherson JP', 'Brown GA', 'Goldenberg GJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 15;53(24):5885-9.,,"['GENBANK/U01915', 'GENBANK/U01919']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous GVHD has also been reported after administration of CSP in patients who have received autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) with untreated marrow for lymphoma or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our study was designed to determine whether CSP administration is associated with appearance of autologous GVHD in patients with AML receiving ABMT with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC)-purged marrow and whether there was a dose-dependent effect of CSP on development of the syndrome. Thirty-three patients with AML (18 in first remission [CR1], 10 in CR2, and 5 in CR3) received intravenous CSP, beginning on the day of ABMT, after a preparative regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide and ABMT with 4HC-treated marrow.

N-myc and to a certain degree L-myc can substitute for c-myc in transformation assays in vitro, and their overexpression can block the differentiation of leukemia cell lines. Immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (IgH) -driven overexpression of N-myc or L-myc genes cause lymphatic and myeloid tumors, respectively, in transgenic mice. Furthermore, the L-myc and N-myc genes are expressed in several human leukemias and leukemia cell lines, L-myc predominantly in myeloid and N-myc both in myeloid and in some lymphoid leukemias. All N/L-myc positive leukemias and leukemia cell lines coexpress the c-myc gene, thus exemplifying a lack of negative cross-regulation between the different myc genes in leukemia cells.

In most patients, BMT is performed at the time of remission which implies that the number of leukemic cells is less than 5% of all hematopoietic cells, namely, 0 to 10(10) leukemia cells in the body. Thus, some patients may well undergo BMT despite the fact that no leukemic cells are left in the body. In this respect, more accurate diagnosis of complete remission status would be to the patients' benefit. To detect minimal residual disease (MRD) not found by light-microscopy, further strategies are required after achieving hematological remission. Cytogenetic methods, Southern blot analysis and conventional immunological techniques can all provide accurate diagnosis, however, the sensitivity of these techniques for the detection of MRD is just as low as that of the light microscopy. Recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become available for the detection of low levels of chimeric bcr-abl transcripts in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph1) ALL patients. With this assay, investigators have reported MRD in patients after chemotherapy or BMT. Most patients who achieve hematological remission after conventional chemotherapy still have bcr-abl transcript detectable by PCR, confirming the general concept that this particular leukemia needs BMT in order to cure the disease. Some patients who had MRD prior to BMT continued disease free survival > 1 year after BMT with a negative PCR result and in these patients, MRD seems to have been eradicated by the BMT procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Miyamura, K', 'Takeo, T', 'Kataoka, T', 'Tahara, T', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Saito, H']","['Miyamura K', 'Takeo T', 'Kataoka T', 'Tahara T', 'Tanimoto M', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309086994 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Oct;11(3-4):181-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199309086994.,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the genes that are responsible for the transforming event(s) in the (presently unknown) target cell; second, the gene(s) that help the progressive accumulation of malignant cells and finally the gene(s) that cause the progression toward a more aggressive lymphoma. The possibility that the clonal expansion of B-CLL is due to a prolonged life-span of monoclonal B cells rather than to an acceleration of their proliferative activity may now be reinterpreted by taking into account some recent findings on the expression of Bcl-2 gene in B-CLL cells. The Bcl-2 gene product regulates programmed cell death and a number of experiments suggest that Bcl-2 is involved in the selection and maintenance of long-lived memory B cells rescuing them from apoptotic death and leading to their accumulation in the GO phase of the cell cycle. Variant chromosomal translocations have been detected in a small fraction (5-10%) of B-CLL, involving Bcl-2 and the Ig light chain gene. Despite the low percentage of Bcl-2 rearrangements the expression of mRNA and protein is appreciable in most samples of fresh B-CLL cells in an amount comparable to that observed in Karpas 422 cells, which contain a t(14;18).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schena, M', 'Gottardi, D', 'Ghia, P', 'Larsson, L G', 'Carlsson, M', 'Nilsson, K', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Schena M', 'Gottardi D', 'Ghia P', 'Larsson LG', 'Carlsson M', 'Nilsson K', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309086993 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Oct;11(3-4):173-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199309086993.,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, ionizing radiation induces DNA damage through the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. Although little is known of the specific determinants of ara-C and ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity, recent work has shown that both are capable of inducing internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in a pattern consistent with programmed cell death (apoptosis). In order to assess the importance of apoptosis in drug and ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity in the U-937 myelomonocytic cell line, we created cell lines that constitutively express a transfected bcl-2 gene. Bcl-2 was capable of inhibiting 40-50% of the ara-C and ionizing radiation-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation at all tested concentrations. However, cell survival following exposure to these agents was only increased in the bcl-2 transfectants at relatively low doses of ara-C and ionizing radiation. These data demonstrate that although bcl-2 is capable of inhibiting ara-C and ionizing radiation-induced DNA fragmentation in myeloid cells, it increases cell survival only at low doses of these agents. This suggests that apoptosis may be a less important mechanism of cytotoxicity at higher doses of ara-C and ionizing radiation than it is at lower doses.","['Manome, Y', 'Weichselbaum, R R', 'Kufe, D W', 'Fine, H A']","['Manome Y', 'Weichselbaum RR', 'Kufe DW', 'Fine HA']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects/*radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1993;5(3):139-44.,,,,,,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the fact that unrepaired damage in transcribed genes has been well correlated with sensitivity to a number of DNA damaging agents, the correlations with therapeutic response might be improved if the level of DNA damage in specific genes was assessed. We previously established a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay to measure cisplatin lesions in specific genes. The major advantages of this assay include its potential to quantify DNA lesions produced by any DNA damaging agent, and to measure it in minute samples of cells. This assay has been further improved to realize this potential. Specifically, cells were damaged with cisplatin, a related analogue ormaplatin, and ultraviolet light, and PCR was performed on the DNA from 1000 cells after direct lysis with no purification. Human HL-60 cells were used to compare the efficacy of the various agents to damage the alpha-fetoprotein gene. This was then extrapolated to damage in the total genome and compared to the cytotoxicity for each agent. At a dose that killed 50% of the cells, ormaplatin, cisplatin and ultraviolet light produced 19,200, 48,000, and 1,080,000 lesions per cell, demonstrating that ormaplatin lesions were the most effective at killing cells. Mononuclear cells were obtained from freshly isolated blood from five individuals. These cells were damaged with the three agents, and PCR of the alpha-fetoprotein gene was performed.

Of the 5 patients lacking 11q23 rearrangements, some of whom had monoblastic features, none had an MLL rearrangement, although 4 had received topo II inhibitors. Our study indicates that the MLL gene rearrangements are similar both in AML that develops de novo and in t-AML. The association of exposure to topo II-reactive chemotherapy with 11q23 rearrangements involving the MLL gene in t-AML suggests that topo II may play a role in the aberrant recombination events that occur in this region both in AML de novo and in t-AML.","['Super, H J', 'McCabe, N R', 'Thirman, M J', 'Larson, R A', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Philip, P', 'Diaz, M O', 'Rowley, J D']","['Super HJ', 'McCabe NR', 'Thirman MJ', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Philip P', 'Diaz MO', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and cell Biology, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66118-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Dec 15;82(12):3705-11.,['MLL'],,,,,"['CA38725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

A stereoisomer of retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, is a high-affinity ligand for RXR and binds efficiently to RAR. In contrast, all-trans-retinoic acid interacts 40-fold less efficiently with RXR as compared with RAR. To clarify the biologic role of retinoic acid compounds (all-trans,- 9-cis-, and 13-cis-retinoic acid) in hematopoietic cells, we studied their effects on clonal growth, differentiation, and expression of RAR-alpha and RXR-alpha genes in HL-60 cells. At very low concentrations (10(-15) to 10(-12) mmol/L), each retinoid enhanced clonal growth of HL-60 cells. These concentrations of the retinoids had no capacity to induce differentiation of leukemic cells as measured by ability either to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium and to express CD11b antigens, suggesting that retinoids at very low concentrations may stimulate proliferation of leukemic cells rather than induce their differentiation. These findings may help explain why patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia may relapse while receiving retinoic acids. With continuous therapy, retinoids are metabolized rapidly with increased urinary excretion, lowering their plasma levels to a range that may stimulate proliferation without inducing differentiation of leukemic cells. In contrast, we found that at higher concentrations (> or = 10(-11) mmol/L) each retinoid inhibited clonal growth, reduced c-myc RNA levels, and induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. 9-cis-retinoic acid was a slightly more potent inducer of differentiation than all-trans-retinoic acid; the mechanism for this increased potency and its clinical potential requires additional studies. Steady-state levels of RAR-alpha mRNA in HL-60 cells were not affected by either 9-cis- and all-trans-retinoic acid. In contrast, 9-cis-retinoic acid, but not all-trans-retinoic acid, reduced RXR-alpha mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner.","['Kizaki, M', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Tanosaki, R', 'Nakajima, H', 'Morikawa, M', 'Sakashita, A', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kizaki M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Tanosaki R', 'Nakajima H', 'Morikawa M', 'Sakashita A', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66103-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Dec 15;82(12):3592-9.,,,,,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify chimeric cDNAs allows sensitive detection of the neoplastic clone for diagnostic and monitoring studies in these leukemias. Nonetheless, the clinical relevance of minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation by PCR remains controversial. In this study, 9 patients (pts) with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in long-term remission for 4 to 12 years were analyzed for the presence of MRD by RT-PCR amplification of the specific PML/RAR-alpha fusion gene. Seven pts had been treated with conventional chemotherapy (CHT) alone, 1 had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and 1 autologous BMT as consolidation therapy after CHT. In 8 cases, the presence of the t(15;17) rearrangement could be documented in diagnostic BM specimens by cytogenetic and/or molecular analysis. A two-rounds ""nested"" RT-PCR assay with sensitivity levels of 1 in 10(5) was used to analyze BM samples collected at 32 to 141 months from the achievement of complete remission (CR). In no cases were residual PML/RAR-alpha transcripts detectable in these remission controls. All patients are in unmaintained CR at 48 to 154 months from CR and at 6 to 17 months from PCR evaluation. These results suggest that long-term survival of APL is associated with eradication of cells carrying the specific PML/RAR-alpha rearrangement, indicating that PCR negativity should be considered the therapeutic goal in these patients. Our findings further strengthen the clinical relevance of PCR monitoring studies in APL, as opposite to other leukemic subtypes (chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia-M2) in which the prognostic significance of PCR evaluation is unclear.","['Diverio, D', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Biondi, A', 'Avvisati, G', 'Petti, M C', 'Mandelli, F', 'Pelicci, G', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Diverio D', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Biondi A', 'Avvisati G', 'Petti MC', 'Mandelli F', 'Pelicci G', 'Lo Coco F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66098-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Dec 15;82(12):3556-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A nested set of DNA fragments from the LIF gene 5'-flanking region was placed upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and assayed for their ability to direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in STO-fibroblasts. The essential promoter of the LIF-gene, giving rise to low levels of CAT expression, was found to require the major start-site of transcription (+1), a TATA-box (-31) and up to 72 additional 5' nucleotides (-32 to -103). A negative regulatory element which abolished CAT-activity was identified between positions -360 and -249. The SV40 enhancer element was able to override this apparent negative element.

Both cis- and trans-RuCl2(DMSO)4 significantly prolonged the survival time of leukaemic mice, independently of the tumour line used. Unlike cisplatin, the prolongation of life-span of tumour-bearing hosts caused by ruthenium complexes was not supported by a parallel inhibition of the number of tumour cells in the treated hosts, as evidenced by tumour cell count in the peritoneal cavity and by vivo-vivo bioassays of blood samples and of whole brains. Thus, cis- and trans-RuCl2(DMSO)4 appear capable of preventing leukaemic spread into the central nervous system also when the number of tumour cells in the peritoneal cavity and in the blood stream is as high as in untreated controls. When the drug-induced DNA damage was investigated by modifying double stranded DNA and identifying the lesions able to inhibit DNA synthesis in vitro, trans-RuCl2(DMSO)4 and, to a lesser extent, cis-RuCl2(DMSO)4 formed blocking lesions at the same sites of cisplatin; nevertheless, the mechanism of antitumour activity of ruthenium complexes appears to be different from that of cisplatin for the absence of any relationship between cytotoxicity and prevention of leukaemic dissemination into the central nervous system. These data indicate that the activity of cis- and trans-RuCl2(DMSO)4 on the P388 leukaemia is characterised by the lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin and by the alteration of the metastasising behaviour of leukaemic cells which lose their natural capacity to invade the central nervous system.","['Coluccia, M', 'Sava, G', 'Loseto, F', 'Nassi, A', 'Boccarelli, A', 'Giordano, D', 'Alessio, E', 'Mestroni, G']","['Coluccia M', 'Sava G', 'Loseto F', 'Nassi A', 'Boccarelli A', 'Giordano D', 'Alessio E', 'Mestroni G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Policlinico, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '11070-19-2 (dichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium II)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organometallic Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Ruthenium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0959-8049(93)90541-m [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(13):1873-9. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90541-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose that the very high white cell count (WCC) led to a hyperviscosity state which resulted in poor absorption of CSF and in so doing, created a clinical picture of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH).","['Guymer, R H', 'Cairns, J D', ""O'Day, J""]","['Guymer RH', 'Cairns JD', ""O'Day J""]","[""St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Aust N Z J Ophthalmol,Australian and New Zealand journal of ophthalmology,8505423,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Pressure', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Fundus Oculi', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Papilledema/complications', 'Pseudotumor Cerebri/*etiology/pathology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Aust N Z J Ophthalmol. 1993 Aug;21(3):181-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the role of such recombination events in FeLV pathogenesis, a molecular clone of subgroup C FeLV, Sarma strain (FSC), was tested for induction of aplastic anemia in the absence or presence of mixtures of recombinants between FSC and an enFeLV element. In the recombinants, FSC sequences in the viral surface glycoprotein (SU) protein were variably replaced by the corresponding sequences of the enFeLV. The results showed that the virus mixtures varied in their infectivity to neonatal specific pathogen-free cats. One group of mixtures, although exhibiting relatively reduced infectivity, represented the most acute disease-inducing agents. The presence of recombinants in this mixture significantly accelerated the development of erythrocyte aplasia compared to cats infected with FSC alone. In addition, infected cells appeared to be distributed differently in various hematopoietic organs with respect to infection with FSC versus viral mixture. Viral recombinants which were present in this inoculum mixture, however, could not be detected in the plasma or infected tissues of the cats at the end stage of the disease, although their presence in the plasma at the early stages could be detected. Clearly, parental FSC outgrew the recombinants in the infected animals, since its detection was prominent at all stages of the progression of the disease. Therefore, we hypothesize that recombinants initially present in the infected animals, while only poorly replicated compared to FSC in the host, might have had the opportunity to infect certain target cells (potentially erythroid progenitor cells) and then disappeared with the associated cytopathic effect.","['Mathes, L E', 'Pandey, R', 'Chakrabarti, R', 'Hofman, F M', 'Hayes, K A', 'Stromberg, P', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Mathes LE', 'Pandey R', 'Chakrabarti R', 'Hofman FM', 'Hayes KA', 'Stromberg P', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Genetic Variation', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/analysis/blood', 'Virulence']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71021-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1021 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Jan;198(1):185-95. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1021.,,,,,,"['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed a collection of spontaneous, highly attenuated mutants of vaccinia virus isolated from persistently infected Friend erythroleukemia cells (E. Paez, S. Dallo, and M. Esteban, J. Virol. 61, 2642-2647, 1987) for the ability to express HA during virus infection. After 14 cell passages, all the mutants isolated were hemadsorption negative (HAD-) and did not synthesize a HA that could be recognized by anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. All these HA- mutants induced extensive cell-cell fusion (F+), with the exception of two mutants (65-16 and 101-14) isolated from late cell passages. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HA gene in these two mutants confirmed the HA- phenotype. A frameshift mutation very close to the initiation codon resulted in premature translational termination. The truncated gene now only encodes the first 25 amino acids. Analysis of progeny from ""wild-type,"" like early serial passage virus (5-3) X mutant back crosses, shows that for one late passage non-fusogenic small-plaque mutant (101-14) among large plaque progeny there is good correspondence between the ability to fuse and the absence of a viral HA and that each large plaque mutant contains a normal 14 kDa membrane protein. However, with a second serial passage mutant 65-16, which, like 101-14, is a nonfusogenic small-plaque variant, there is again an excellent correlation between the inability to synthesize HA and the ability to fuse, but there is no correlation of plaque size with a normal 14 kDa viral membrane protein, as most large plaque mutants encode a larger, i.e., 17 kDa protein. Rescue experiments of 65-16 with bona fide cloned 14 kDa protein gene confirm that the ability to regulate plaque size and cell fusion in this mutant is due to a protein other than the 14 kDa protein. Marker rescue experiments indicated that the map position of the additional mutation coincided with a small deletion occurring in the HindIII F fragment. This deletion affected the 5'-end and promoter sequences of the 37 kDa envelope protein gene and produced a lack of expression of this protein, shown by others to be involved in the formation of extracellular enveloped virus in infected cells. These results shown that viruses with mutations of viral membrane proteins required for cell fusion and viral dissemination are selected during vaccinia virus persistence in cell culture.","['Ortiz, M A', 'Paez, E']","['Ortiz MA', 'Paez E']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Hemagglutinins, Viral)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hemagglutinins, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Plaque Assay']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71018-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1018 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Jan;198(1):155-68. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1018.,['F13L'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All single-donor apheresis units were sterile, but 6 (0.19%) of the random-donor pools were found to be bacterially contaminated, with 1 unit of 5 in the pool being the source in each case. Contaminants were Staphylococcus epidermidis (4 cases), Bacillus cereus (1), and Staphylococcus aureus (1) at counts of 0.5 x 10(2) to 10(11) colony-forming units per mL in platelet pools and 10(3) to 10(13) colony-forming units per mL in source units.

It is concluded that the risk of platelet contamination is related to the duration of component storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Yomtovian, R', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Goodnough, L T', 'Hirschler, N V', 'Morrissey, A M', 'Jacobs, M R']","['Yomtovian R', 'Lazarus HM', 'Goodnough LT', 'Hirschler NV', 'Morrissey AM', 'Jacobs MR']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacillus cereus/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Platelets/*microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects/*standards', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Staphylococcus aureus/isolation & purification', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/isolation & purification', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1993.331194082380.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1993 Nov-Dec;33(11):902-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1993.331194082380.x.,,,,,,['P30-CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A clinicopathologic study.,1794-9,"BACKGROUND: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a recently described distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by an extremely aggressive clinical course, a leukemic or lymphomatous proliferation of hyperlobulated peripheral T cells, and an association with infection by a retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). The authors present a patient with ATLL who initially had clinical features of severe uniocular intraocular inflammation, simulating acute retinal necrosis or herpetic retinitis, but results of histopathologic examination of the globe showed ATLL. PATIENT: A 38-year-old man had severe unilateral intraocular inflammation associated with widespread diffuse retinitis. Two weeks later, a focal retinitis with vasculitis developed nasal to the optic disc in the opposite eye. Shortly thereafter, mental disturbance developed, and the patient died less than 3 months after onset of the ocular symptoms. RESULTS: Results of postmortem examination showed atypical lymphocytic infiltration in the eyes, brain, and other systemic organs. Results of histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies showed that the atypical cells infiltrating the ocular tissues were ATLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Patients infected with HTLV-I initially can have intraocular T-cell lymphoma that simulates acute retinal necrosis or herpetic retinitis.","['Kohno, T', 'Uchida, H', 'Inomata, H', 'Fukushima, S', 'Takeshita, M', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Kohno T', 'Uchida H', 'Inomata H', 'Fukushima S', 'Takeshita M', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Adult', 'Fundus Oculi', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Retinal Diseases/metabolism/*pathology', 'Retinal Necrosis Syndrome, Acute/diagnosis', 'Retinitis/diagnosis']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(93)31396-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(13)31398-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1993 Dec;100(12):1794-9. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(13)31398-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the ability of interferon alfa-2b and infusions of mononuclear cells from the marrow donor to induce a graft-versus-leukemia reaction in patients with CML in relapse after bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: Eleven patients with relapsed CML after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with interferon alfa-2b and infusions of mononuclear cells. The patients were monitored for toxic effects, for hematologic and cytogenetic responses, and, with use of the polymerase chain reaction, for elimination of cells containing the bcr/abl messenger RNA transcript characteristic of the leukemic cells. RESULTS: Six of the eight patients with stable CML after relapse had complete remissions according to molecular genetic criteria, since no cells with bcr/abl messenger RNA transcripts were detected (the method can identify 1 leukemic cell among 1 million normal cells). The three patients with accelerated CML after relapse did not enter remission. Myelosuppression was prominent in eight patients. Grade I acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in six patients, and grade III acute GVHD occurred in three. Limited chronic GVHD developed in five patients. CONCLUSIONS: The induction of a graft-versus-leukemia reaction with interferon alfa-2b and infusions of donor mononuclear cells in patients with CML in relapse after bone marrow transplantation is an effective antileukemic therapy that may offer an alternative to a second marrow transplantation.","['Porter, D L', 'Roth, M S', 'McGarigle, C', 'Ferrara, J L', 'Antin, J H']","['Porter DL', 'Roth MS', 'McGarigle C', 'Ferrara JL', 'Antin JH']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction']",1994/01/13 00:00,1994/01/13 00:01,['1994/01/13 00:00'],"['1994/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199401133300204 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 Jan 13;330(2):100-6. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199401133300204.,,,,,,"['CA39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL07623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-three of 143 patients who experienced disease recurrence during the first five years after diagnosis died during the period of observation, compared to 18 of 448 patients who did not experience disease recurrence during the first five years after diagnosis. The sex-specific standardized mortality ratios for the group of patients who never relapsed or relapsed more than five years after diagnosis were not significantly different from those of the New York State population. Cox proportional hazards modelling of the subgroup of patients who relapsed during the first five years after diagnosis demonstrated that disease which was treated surgically, a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and older age at diagnosis were significantly associated with further survival in this group, whereas similar modelling of the patients who did not experience disease recurrence during the first five years after diagnosis failed to identify any variables which were associated with continued survival. The results of this study suggest that childhood and adolescent cancer patients who survive for five years without disease recurrence have a survival rate similar to that of the general population.

Plasma proteins (prealbumin, PA; albumin, Alb; transferrin, Tr; retinol-binding protein, RBP) and acute phase-reactant proteins (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, AGP; C-reactive protein, CRP; ceruloplasmin, CER) were measured by radial immunodiffusion. Results show that there were no significant deficits in anthropometric measurements among leukemic children. In contrast, the mean levels of all plasma proteins, especially PA (P < 0.005), were significantly lower in the D/R group than in the REM group. All D/R children, compared to 59% of those in remission, had PA levels < 20 mg/dl. Only the D/R group had abnormal levels of RBP, Tr, and Alb. Children who were treated with prednisone had significantly higher mean levels of PA, RBP, and AGP than those who were not receiving prednisone. The mean levels of acute phase-reactant proteins in these leukemic children were comparable to those of healthy children.

Patients who relapsed after bone marrow transplantation were eligible. Twenty-six children were included. Diagnoses were as follows: 13 AML, 9 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 4 undifferentiated leukemia (AUL). All patients had been very highly pretreated, especially with anthracyclines, and most of them were of poor prognosis. The overall response rate was 46% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 27-65%. According to diagnosis, complete remission (CR) rates are: AML: 5/13, ALL: 5/9, and AUL: 2/4. Four children died, three from infection and one from acute lysis syndrome. The major toxicity was infection with grade 3 and 4 episodes occurring in 42% of patients.

While analyzing the bone marrow with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, which detect neuroblasts and other defining B-, T-, and myloid lineage, we identified two infants with stage IV-S neuroblastoma whose bone marrow contained a large population of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like cells. This population expressed HLA-DR, CD19(B1), CD10(CALLA), and occasionally CD20(B1). Since 1988, 17 additional patients with advanced neuroblastoma (IV-S, III, and IV) were studied by us. In 10 of the 19 patients, the bone marrow revealed an expanded CD10 population (20-70%). It appears that this group of patients has a better prognosis. Out of 9 patients who did not have an expanded CD10 population, 8 died within 9 months from diagnosis, whereas out of 10 patients with an expanded CD10 population only one died and the others are alive, 6-30 months from diagnosis (P < 0.001). An expanded CD10 population in the bone marrow of disseminated neuroblastoma patients may therefore serve as a prognostic factor. Apart from the prognostic value of this particular population in the single patient, its presence may shed light on the interrelationship between the immune system and the neuroendocrine compartment.","['Mandel, M', 'Rechavi, G', 'Neumann, Y', 'Biniaminov, M', 'Rosenthal, E', 'Toren, A', 'Brok-Simoni, F', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Ramot, B']","['Mandel M', 'Rechavi G', 'Neumann Y', 'Biniaminov M', 'Rosenthal E', 'Toren A', 'Brok-Simoni F', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Ramot B']","['Department of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Neuroblastoma/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950220210 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;22(2):115-8. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950220210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which LPS activates these cells to express cytokines are not completely characterized. The present study addressed the role of different protein kinases in the LPS induction of cytokines. It is shown that LPS induced a 12- to 16-fold increase in IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA levels, and this was completely or more than 80% blocked by the protein tyrosine kinase specific inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein at the concentrations of 1.7 and 37 microM, respectively. Protein kinase C inhibition by staurosporine reduced LPS induction of TNF-alpha, whereas it had no effects on IL-6 and IL-1 beta. Inhibition of protein kinase A by H89 reduced IL-6 mRNA levels but did not detectably change IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha mRNA levels. In contrast, LPS did not increase leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA, which was constitutively expressed and not significantly reduced by these inhibitors. In addition to cytokine mRNA levels, LPS-induced IL-6 protein synthesis and IL-6 bioactivity were also reduced to baseline levels by the PTK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein. Both PTK inhibitors also reduced the LPS activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), which is a transcription factor involved in the expression of cytokine genes such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The activation of NF-kappa B was also reduced by H89, whereas staurosporine had no effect on this response. In summary, these findings suggest that protein kinase C and protein kinase A appear to have selective effects in the LPS induction of cytokines, whereas PTK is required for LPS induction of a broad spectrum of cytokines and NF-kappa B activation in monocytes.","['Geng, Y', 'Zhang, B', 'Lotz, M']","['Geng Y', 'Zhang B', 'Lotz M']","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Dec 15;151(12):6692-700.,,,,,,"['AR39799/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the presence of two nuclear factor complexes that bound to the IL-6 kappa B site. One was constitutively expressed, and the other was inducible by p40tax. Taken together, HTLV-1 p40tax directly induces IL-6 gene expression through the IL-6 kappa B site, indicating the close association between IL-6 overproduction and HTLV-1 infection.","['Muraoka, O', 'Kaisho, T', 'Tanabe, M', 'Hirano, T']","['Muraoka O', 'Kaisho T', 'Tanabe M', 'Hirano T']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology', 'Plasmids', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(93)90026-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(93)90026-x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1993 Aug;37(2-3):159-65. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(93)90026-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVHD occurs after allogeneic marrow transplantation when immunologically competent T lymphocytes in the donor marrow identify the host's antigens as foreign and attempt to reject host tissues. Acute GVHD occurs within three months after marrow transplantation and may affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and immune system. Even with prophylactic immunosuppression, acute GVHD occurs in 20% to 80% of patients. Moderate to severe GVHD (grades II-IV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Conventional GVHD prophylaxis consists of immunosuppressives such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. Methotrexate and cyclosporine are equally effective in preventing GVHD. A combination of both drugs is better than either drug alone and results in an improved survival rate. The addition of corticosteroids to methotrexate, cyclosporine, or antithymocyte globulin is also more effective than single-drug therapy. Serial administration of intravenous immune globulin may contribute additional protection against acute GVHD. There is conflicting evidence concerning the prophylactic efficacy of pentoxifylline. Elimination of T lymphocytes from the donor marrow before transplantation has been associated with less GVHD but a higher incidence of graft failure. Total elimination of GVHD in patients with leukemia may cause loss of a graft-versus-leukemia effect, resulting in increased relapse rates and decreased long-term survival. Promising experimental prophylactic agents include thalidomide, zolimomab aritox, tacrolimus, antibodies to cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD, and monoclonal antibodies against cytokine receptors on T lymphocytes. Current research efforts are also directed toward eliminating GVHD without compromising the graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Schwinghammer, T L', 'Bloom, E J']","['Schwinghammer TL', 'Bloom EJ']","['Department of Pharmacy and Therapeutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Pharm,Clinical pharmacy,8207437,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclosporine/blood/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Pharm. 1993 Oct;12(10):736-61.,,,,,218,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to identify the risk factors for early mortality in acute lymphocytic leukaemia patients treated with bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: Prospectively collected data on 76 acute lymphocytic leukaemia patients, treated with 60 mg/kg cyclophosphamide for two consecutive days, before (32 patients) or after (44 patients) total body irradiation who received an allogeneic (56 patients) or autologous (20 patients) bone marrow transplantation were considered in the multivariate analysis including fifteen potentially prognostic variables for early mortality. RESULTS: In the entire group, patients older than 20 years had a relative risk for early mortality of 3.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-11.76) and those with a Karnofsky Index lower than 90% had a relative risk of 5.56 (95% CI: 1.29-25). In the subgroup of allogeneic patients, those over 20 years had a relative risk of 5.17 (95% CI: 1.30-20.6); the relative risk for patients with a Karnofsky index < 90% was 10.55 (95% CI: 1.55-71.43) and 8.04 (95% CI: 43-45.07) for acute severe graft-versus-host disease. Among radiation therapy variables only dose-rate showed a trend towards better prognosis in patients treated with less than 5 cGy/min. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients and within the range of treatment variables studied, age, Karnofsky index, and graft-versus-host disease are the most important factors related with early mortality.","['Algara, M', 'Valls, A', 'Marrugat, J', 'Granena, A']","['Algara M', 'Valls A', 'Marrugat J', 'Granena A']","['Servicio de Radioterapia, Hospital de la Esperanza, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Med,The European journal of medicine,9209793,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med. 1993 Aug-Sep;2(7):386-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells with NK markers or function are not a prominent feature of lymphoid infiltrates in solid tumors and, when present, do not appear to correlate with other prognostic variables. Nevertheless, NK cells among IL-2-activated TIL mediate antitumor cytotoxicity. Many studies indicate that NK activity is reduced in patients with advanced cancer. In some of these studies, low NK activity has been shown to be an unfavorable prognostic variable. PBL, splenic and bone marrow NK activity in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is also decreased. However, adherent IL-2-activated lymphocytes composed primarily of NK cells were found to be cytotoxic against AML blasts and could be generated from patients in remission and relapse. The question of whether low NK activity in solid tumors and leukemia is the result of the disease state or contributes to it, remains unanswered. Data are also presented here showing that treated, apparently disease-free patients with high PBL NK activity have a significantly longer metastasis-free survival time than those with low NK activity (n = 91, p < 0.026, Cox proportional hazards test).","['Pross, H F', 'Lotzova, E']","['Pross HF', 'Lotzova E']","[""Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Nat Immun,Natural immunity,9206126,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun. 1993 Jul-Oct;12(4-5):279-92.,,,,,169,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to HTLV-I, the role of HTLV-II in human disease is controversial. However, HTLV-II infection has been documented in several cases of a clinically benign hairy cell leukemia and has also been suggested as a cofactor for HIV-1 disease progression. We report that an HTLV-II isolate (designated FLW) derived from a serum-positive white male can induce cell fusion and significant cytopathic effects in tissue culture. This HTLV-II isolate induced syncytium formation with human T and B cell lines, several human fibroblast cell lines, and, interestingly, HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected cell lines. To elucidate the role in the FLW envelope in this phenomenon, we have cloned the envelope glycoproteins gp46 and gp21 of this isolate. The envelope glycoproteins expressed in the absence of the rest of the viral genome were sufficient to drive syncytium formation in vitro, and preserved the cellular tropism for syncytium formation observed with the native retroviral isolate. Amino acid (aa) sequence analysis demonstrated 88% overall similarity with other HTLV-II envelope glycoproteins. Interestingly, only cells infected by HIV-I, but not parental H9 cells, form syncytia with FLW env-transfected cells as well as with HTLV-II/FLW-infected BJAB-WH cells. Furthermore, antibodies directed at the CD4 receptor failed to inhibit the induction of giant cell formation, implying that the FLW envelope protein was responsible for driving syncytium formation in this system. These observations may be important for the understanding of the processes involved in human retroviral-mediated syncytium formation and may suggest a mechanism whereby HTLV-II could influence the disease process in individuals dually infected with HIV-1 and HTLV-II.","['Wang, B', 'Agadjanyan, M G', 'Srikantan, V', 'Ugen, K E', 'Hall, W', 'Kaplan, M H', 'Dang, K', 'Williams, W V', 'Weiner, D B']","['Wang B', 'Agadjanyan MG', 'Srikantan V', 'Ugen KE', 'Hall W', 'Kaplan MH', 'Dang K', 'Williams WV', 'Weiner DB']","['Institute of Biotechnology and Advanced Molecular Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', '0 (human T-cell leukemia virus type-II protein gp21)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Fibroblasts/microbiology', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'HIV-2/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1993.9.849 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1993 Sep;9(9):849-60. doi: 10.1089/aid.1993.9.849.,"['env', 'rex', 'tat']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zinquin labelled human chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia lymphocytes, rat splenocytes and thymocytes with a weak diffuse fluorescence that was quenched when intracellular Zn was chelated with NNN'N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) and was greatly intensified by pretreatment of cells with the Zn ionophore pyrithione and exogenous Zn. There was substantial heterogeneity of labile Zn among ionophore-treated cells, and fluorescence was largely extranuclear. The average contents of labile Zn in human leukaemic lymphocytes, rat splenocytes and rat thymocytes were approx. 20, 31 and 14 pmol/10(6) cells respectively. Morphological changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation indicated substantial apoptosis in these cells when the level of intracellular labile Zn was decreased by treatment with TPEN. Conversely, increasing labile Zn by pretreatment with Zn plus pyrithione suppressed both spontaneous DNA fragmentation and that induced by the potent apoptosis-induced agents colchicine and dexamethasone. These results suggest that prevention of apoptosis is a function of labile Zn, and that a reduction below a threshold concentration in this Zn pool induces apoptosis.","['Zalewski, P D', 'Forbes, I J', 'Betts, W H']","['Zalewski PD', 'Forbes IJ', 'Betts WH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ethylenediamines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Thiones)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', '6GK82EC25D (pyrithione)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', ""R9PTU1U29I (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine)"", 'Z74RD6XLAC (zinquin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'Ethylenediamines/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinolones', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spleen', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thiones', 'Tosyl Compounds', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/analysis/*metabolism']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2960403 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Dec 1;296 ( Pt 2):403-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2960403.,,,,PMC1137710,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the identity and role of the osteoblast-derived cytokines involved in this process are unclear. To examine which cytokines are regulated by PTH, we assessed cytokine mRNA levels in osteoblasts using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. Of the 16 cytokines we examined, unstimulated MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells expressed mRNA for interleukins 5, 6, and 7, macrophage and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, transforming growth factor beta 1, and leukemia inhibitory factor. PTH specifically increased expression of interleukin-6 (approximately 50-fold) and leukemia inhibitory factor (approximately 10-fold). Levels of both IL-6 and LIF mRNA peaked 30-60 minutes after addition of PTH and returned to baseline by 4-6 h. This rapid and transient mRNA response, which resembles that of immediate early genes, was also observed in primary rat osteoblasts. The transient mRNA response was accompanied by increased secretion of IL-6 protein. Lipopolysaccharide, another stimulator of resorption, increased mRNA levels of a group of cytokines that were not induced by PTH, namely interleukin-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors.

In this study, we examined the urinary excretion of HCMV in children with malignancy using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Urine samples were collected from on-therapy, off-therapy patients with malignancy, and healthy controls. A simple DNA extraction method using glass powder was employed, and inhibitory effect of urine on PCR was prevented. For PCR, a pair of primers from the HCMV major immediate early gene sequence was used. Among patients who received intensive chemotherapy, 52.0% had urinary HCMV excretion after the chemotherapy course. In contrast, off-therapy patients and healthy controls showed a lower incidence of urinary HCMV excretion (20.4 and 8.7%, respectively). The incidence of HCMV urinary excretion in the on-therapy group was significantly higher than healthy controls (P < 0.05). In the on-therapy group, the total white blood cell count of the virus excreters was lower than that of non-excreters. The incidence of HCMV excretion was high in on-therapy patients. Most of the virus excreters were seropositive, so their viruria was thought to be caused by reactivation. Repeated monitoring of virus excretion by this rapid and simple method may be useful to detect HCMV infection early and to control it in such patients.","['Kajiwara, M', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Hirai, K', 'Yata, J']","['Kajiwara M', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Hirai K', 'Yata J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/urine', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*urine', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/urine', 'Reference Values']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1993.tb03078.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1993 Oct;35(5):387-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1993.tb03078.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These retroviral elements are inherited as Mendelian traits. Generally, ERVs are defective without the ability of being expressed as viral particles. However, ERV sequences often have a potential for expression of at least some proteins. So far, the possible biological significance of ERVs is not clear. Nonetheless, there are observations suggesting a connection between ERVs and various diseases. This is the case with murine lupus and a spinal cord disease of certain mouse strains. In the present review, we discuss possible mechanisms by which ERVs could contribute to the development of human degenerative and inflammatory nervous system diseases, including direct effects on nervous system cells and immune cells. Interactions between ERVs and infectious viruses are also discussed.

As the effect of serine-threonine kinases, such as PKC, is often counteracted by specific protein phosphatases, we have now examined the role of phosphatases in the regulation of the phorbol ester (PMA)-induced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene expression in the THP-1 monocytic leukaemia cell line. Okadaic acid (OA) is a potent tumour promoter, the function of which is based on its activity to inhibit the serine/threonine specific phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A, respectively). Thus, it mimicks or potentiates the action of PKC activators in several cell types. Our data demonstrate that alone OA induced a very weak expression of IL-1 beta mRNA, but it strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta expression. To analyse the site of action of OA, the cells were transiently transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-reporter plasmid containing the AP-1 binding site as the enhancer. Alone, OA was a weak inducer of CAT-activity in these cells, but again it strongly enhanced the PMA-induced response. Similar data were obtained with cells transfected with a reporter plasmid containing the PMA-responsive element (containing a putative AP-1 binding site) of the IL-1 beta gene. Thus, these data indicate that the PMA-induced AP-1 enhancer activity, which is required for the expression of the IL-1 beta gene, is controlled in these cells by PP1 and/or PP2A. As OA did not synergize with PMA in the induction of expression of genes encoding the AP-1 proteins (c-fos, c-jun, junB), it is likely that OA potentiates the AP-1 enhancer activity by its effect on protein phosphorylation.","['Hurme, M', 'Matikainen, S']","['Hurme M', 'Matikainen S']","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb03243.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1993 Dec;38(6):570-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb03243.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On addition of external Ca2+ to cells with empty stores there was an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) which preceded the refilling of the stores. The increase in [Ca2+]i was faster than the refilling, by 3- to 15-fold, depending on the cell type. In measurements in single HL60 cells we found that the refilling of the stores correlated with the extent of the [Ca2+]i increase on addition of external Ca2+. The cells showing no [Ca2+]i increase were unable to refill their stores. The addition of Ni2+ to the extracellular medium prevented both the [Ca2+]i increase and the refilling of the stores. These results indicate that the limiting step for store refilling is the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium to the cytosol. Hence, we conclude that extracellular Ca2+ cannot gain access directly to the intracellular Ca2+ stores in these cells, but must first enter the cytosol and be taken up from there into the stores.","['Montero, M', 'Alonso-Torre, S R', 'Alvarez, J', 'Sanchez, A', 'Garcia-Sancho, J']","['Montero M', 'Alonso-Torre SR', 'Alvarez J', 'Sanchez A', 'Garcia-Sancho J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Fisiologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Valladolid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Fura-2', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00374909 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 1993 Sep;424(5-6):465-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00374909.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recent observations suggested that cytogenetically identical t(1;19) translocations can result in the transcription of different mRNA species and that expression of the E2A/PBX1 message may be restricted to patients with the t(1;19) who display a pre-B phenotype of ALL. To further assess the correlation between the immunologic subtypes of the disease and specific genetic alterations, we have performed cytogenetic and molecular analyses in 221 children with B-lineage ALL. Expression of the chimeric E2A/PBX1 message was detected in 21 patients. Out of 14 patients, in whom cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (cig) analyses were available, no less than four had a cig- B-cell precursor ALL, whereas 10 displayed a cig+ B-ALL immunophenotype. These findings are at variance with a recent report in which expression of the E2A/PBX1 message was linked exclusively to a subset of patients who displayed a cig+ pre-B-cell precursor phenotype of ALL. In seven cases diagnosed before 1986, cig analyses were not available, and consequently E2A/PBX1 expression could not be correlated to a particular immunological subtype of B-cell precursor ALL. Our results have important implications for the detection of residual disease in pediatric patients where expression of the typical E2A/PBX1 mRNA may occur both in cig+ (pre-B) and cig- (early pre-B) immunologic subtypes of ALL.","['Izraeli, S', 'Henn, T', 'Strobl, H', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Kovar, H', 'Haas, O A', 'Harbott, J', 'Bartram, C R', 'Gadner, H', 'Lion, T']","['Izraeli S', 'Henn T', 'Strobl H', 'Ludwig WD', 'Kovar H', 'Haas OA', 'Harbott J', 'Bartram CR', 'Gadner H', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):2054-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy produced consistent reductions of sCD23 levels in two responding patients. We conclude that: (i) sCD23 is considerably elevated in CLL, correlates with the tumor mass and clinical stage, and could be helpful in monitoring these patients; and (ii) sIL-2R, sCD8, and sTfR levels are less specifically increased and could be influenced by other factors such as immune activation and erythropoiesis.","['Beguin, Y', 'Lampertz, S', 'De Groote, D', 'Igot, D', 'Malaise, M', 'Fillet, G']","['Beguin Y', 'Lampertz S', 'De Groote D', 'Igot D', 'Malaise M', 'Fillet G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/blood', 'CD4 Antigens/blood', 'CD8 Antigens/blood', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Solubility']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):2019-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments were carried out with the leukemic cell lines HL-60 and M07e and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin AG82. Both the tyrosine kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis of HL-60 and M07e cells. This was indicated by the appearance of DNA degradation and morphologic evidence of nuclear condensation and fragmentation. It was also confirmed by flow cytometry of DNA, which showed apoptotic cells as a fraction of cells characterized by a diminished DNA stainability, represented on the DNA frequency histograms as a distinct peak below the G0/G1 population. Kinase inhibitors also reduced the fraction of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. That tyrphostin specifically inhibited tyrosine kinases was further suggested by the prevention of its effects by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (vanadate), at least during the first 18-24 h of treatment. The incomplete prevention of genistein effects by vanadate suggests that genistein is a less specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinases than tyrphostin, and may also act as an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. Vanadate also prevented apoptosis and reduction of the S phase in M07e cells cultured for 24 h in the absence of growth factors. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step in IL-3 and GM-CSF signal transduction. Since in our experimental model the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibition and growth factor deprivation could be reversed by concomitant inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases, it is suggested that a balance between tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases establishes whether a cell will survive or undergo apoptosis.","['Bergamaschi, G', 'Rosti, V', 'Danova, M', 'Ponchio, L', 'Lucotti, C', 'Cazzola, M']","['Bergamaschi G', 'Rosti V', 'Danova M', 'Ponchio L', 'Lucotti C', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, IRCCS Policlinico S.

To date, the main leukemia-specific DNA sequences used as PCR targets in detection of MRD are breakpoint fusion regions of chromosome translocations and junctional regions of rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TcR) genes. The recently identified tal-1 deletions involving the sil and tal-1 genes, provide a potential MRD-PCR target. tal-1 deletions are site-specific because they are mediated via recombination signal sequences homologous to Ig/TcR genes. In line with this homology, tal-1 deletions also show random insertion and deletion of nucleotides at their breakpoints, resulting in highly variable breakpoint fusion regions. The fusion region diversity can be applied to design patient-specific oligonucleotide probes. Our Southern blot analyses of a large series of 313 acute leukemias with a specific tal-1 deletion probe (SILDB) demonstrated that tal-1 deletions exclusively occur in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and not in precursor B-ALL or acute non-lymphocytic leukemias. In addition, we did not detect tal-1 deletions in normal blood cells and normal thymocytes by PCR analysis. The diversity observed in tal-1 deletion fusion regions with an average insertion and deletion of approximately 7 and approximately 6 nucleotides, respectively, allowed us to design fusion-region-specific probes. The specificity of the fusion-region probes was proven and the detection limit of the MRD-PCR technique was tested in a series of dilution experiments. The observed detection limit of 10(-5) indicates that tal-1 deletions in T-ALL represent ideal leukemia-specific PCR targets for detection of MRD.","['Breit, T M', 'Beishuizen, A', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Mol, E J', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Breit TM', 'Beishuizen A', 'Ludwig WD', 'Mol EJ', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University/University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):2004-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Response to agents in outgrowth experiments was examined under both continuous exposure (120 h, where MTX resistance is not observed) and short-term (6-14.5 h) exposure. During continuous exposure to various classes of agents, cross-resistance of R3/7 and R30dm that correlated with FPGS level was not observed, although some minor (< or = 3-fold) stochastic variations in sensitivity were noted. These agents included actinomycin D, Adriamycin, etoposide, vincristine, cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside, 5-fluorouracil, and some other antifolates. Cross-resistance during continuous exposure that did correlate with FPGS level was noted, however, to glutamate-containing thymidylate synthase inhibitors (including ICI D1694) and, to a minor extent, to 6-mercaptopurine and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. Slight collateral sensitivity during continuous exposure that apparently correlated with FPGS level was noted to the lipid-soluble antifolate trimetrexate and to 5,8-dideazapteroyl-L-ornithine, an FPGS-specific inhibitor. In short-term exposures (where MTX resistance of the sublines is observed), the resistant sublines displayed sensitivity or cross-resistance to each agent that was qualitatively similar to that observed for the same agent in continuous exposure. Because of the requirement for reduced folates in the anti-DNA mechanism of action of fluoropyrimidines and the current clinical use of leucovorin (LV) to enhance their effects, the interaction of LV and fluoropyrimidines was examined. The results suggest that even highly FPGS-deficient cells are as sensitive to the effects of LV modulation as are wild-type cells even at fluoropyrimidine exposure times as short as 4 h.","['McGuire, J J', 'Heitzman, K J', 'Haile, W H', 'Russell, C A', 'McCloskey, D E', 'Piper, J R']","['McGuire JJ', 'Heitzman KJ', 'Haile WH', 'Russell CA', 'McCloskey DE', 'Piper JR']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0SXY5ET48B (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid)', '43ZWB253H4 (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid)', '675-21-8 (5-fluoropyrimidine)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/*deficiency', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1996-2003.,,,,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity of interferon alpha in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,1990-5,"Leukemic cells from most cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) rapidly die by apoptosis in vitro, unless they are cultured onto bone marrow-derived stromal layers. We have recently established a stroma-supported tissue culture technique that allows long-term culture of leukemic lymphoblasts. In this study, we used this technique to examine interferon alpha (IFN alpha) cytotoxicity to ALL blasts. In 16 ALL cases tested (14 B-lineage ALL, 2 T-ALL), the number of cells recovered after 7 days of culture on stromal feeder layers was 60-178% (median, 108%) of those originally seeded. The percentage of lymphoblasts killed by 2000 U/ml IFN alpha 2b after 7 days of culture, ranged from < 1% to 91% (median, 56%). Cytotoxicity was (i) dose-dependent, (ii) eliminated by a neutralizing antibody to IFN alpha, and (iii) accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of a 135 kDa protein, which was detectable after 5 minutes of treatment. Numbers of residual normal lymphoid cells in the cultures remained low and conditioned medium prepared from IFN alpha-stimulated T, NK, and stromal cells was not cytotoxic to ALL blast cells. In contrast to results in freshly isolated ALL cells, six ALL cell lines tested were completely resistant to IFN alpha cytotoxicity. We conclude that IFN alpha is directly cytotoxic in most ALL cases but that the intensity of its effects varies widely among cases. The method used in this study may be applied to evaluate leukemic blast cell sensitivity to compounds with potential antileukemic activity, and to select patients to be entered in to clinical trials.","['Manabe, A', 'Yi, T', 'Kumagai, M', 'Campana, D']","['Manabe A', 'Yi T', 'Kumagai M', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1990-5.,,,,,,"['P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Seven cohorts of patients treated for six different types of primary tumor have been followed closely for leukemic complications, and 115 consecutive patients with t-MDS or t-AML, including 45 cases from the cohorts, have been investigated cytogenetically at our institutions during the past 16 years. In patients primarily treated with alkylating agents, the risk of t-MDS and t-AML increased by approximately 1% per year from 2 to at least 8 years after start of treatment. In most cases, the disease presented as t-MDS with loss of a whole chromosome 5 or 7, or various parts of their long arms, and the leukemias were of FAB-subtypes M1, M2, or M4. In patients treated with drugs targeting at DNA-topoisomerase II, such as etoposide, doxorubicin, 4-epidoxorubicin, or mitoxantrone combined with drugs reacting directly with DNA, such as cisplatin or alkylating agents, the risk of leukemia increased much more steeply from only one year after start of therapy. These early onset cases often presented as overt leukemia of FAB-subtypes M4 or M5 with balanced translocations to chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22, whereas later onset cases often shared characteristics with cases observed after therapy with alkylating agents alone. Both alkylation of DNA and poisoning of DNA-topoisomerase II may result in development of t-AML with different clinical and cytogenetic characteristics. There may be a synergistic leukemogenic effect between the two types of drug, and in patients with germ cell tumors treated with etoposide, cisplatin and bleomycin, reassessment suggested the risk of leukemia to increase exponentially with increasing doses of cisplatin and etoposide.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Philip, P', 'Larsen, S O', 'Andersson, M', 'Daugaard, G', 'Ersboll, J', 'Hansen, S W', 'Hou-Jensen, K', 'Nielsen, D', 'Sigsgaard, T C']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Philip P', 'Larsen SO', 'Andersson M', 'Daugaard G', 'Ersboll J', 'Hansen SW', 'Hou-Jensen K', 'Nielsen D', 'Sigsgaard TC', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology L 4132, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Denmark', 'Etoposide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Germinoma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1975-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay allows semiquantitative determination of the relative abundance of cells carrying N-RAS mutations. Clonal activation of N-RAS, noted in the large majority of leukemic cells of the six of these patients, was correlated significantly (p = 0.0003) with the ability of these cells to express interleukin 6 (IL-6), previously shown to be expressed at high levels in approximately 30% of primary AML cells. In 16 patients, the presence of N-RAS mutations was observed only in subpopulations of leukemic cells. The 'subclonal' involvement of some but not all leukemic cells was further demonstrated by PCR analysis of individual clones grown in soft agar culture.

We have investigated the transcription and protein expression of mb-1 and B29 genes during B-cell development. Sixty human continuous cell lines (35 B-lineage, 11 T-lineage, 11 myeloid-lineage and three non-hematopoietic) and 75 hematopoietic malignancies (55 B-lineage, 12 T-lineage and eight myeloid-lineage), were tested for RNA expression by Northern blotting experiments with the mb-1 pRA3 cDNA probe, and a newly isolated B29 cDNA probe. Protein expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy of cytocentrifuge preparations, which were labeled with the anti-mb-1 HM57 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and an anti-B29 polyclonal antiserum, directed against intracellular epitopes of these polypeptides. Except for two early precursor B-cell lines, mb-1 and B29 transcripts and proteins were detected in all B-cell lines and B-cell malignancies, i.e. from immature to more mature B cells, irrespective of their Ig class expression. Transcription of mb-1 genes seems to be down-regulated at the plasma cell stage, because no mb-1 transcripts and mb-1 proteins could be detected in the four plasma cell lines and two plasma cell leukemias tested. B29 transcripts were detectable in these cell samples, but low levels of B29 proteins were only detected in one plasma cell line. The HM57 mAb gave strong labeling on fresh cytocentrifuge preparations of all B-cell samples, and this mb-1 protein expression appeared to be B-cell specific. We therefore conclude that the HM57 mAb is well suited for the detection of the mb-1 molecule as a pan-B-cell marker for the diagnosis of immature and mature B-cell malignancies. The expression pattern of the mb-1 protein is comparable to that of the CD19 and CD22 antigens, but has the advantage of being B-lineage specific. Although B29 protein expression was restricted to B-lineage cells, the anti-B29 antiserum is less suitable for diagnosis of B-cell malignancies, because of the variable and generally weak signals on cytocentrifuge preparations.","['Verschuren, M C', 'Comans-Bitter, W M', 'Kapteijn, C A', 'Mason, D Y', 'Brouns, G S', 'Borst, J', 'Drexler, H G', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Verschuren MC', 'Comans-Bitter WM', 'Kapteijn CA', 'Mason DY', 'Brouns GS', 'Borst J', 'Drexler HG', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University/University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1939-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extramedullary toxicities, even at the highest ara-C dose level (e.g. 14 g/m2 per day) were mild (e.g. CALGB grade I or II), and consisted of diarrhea, fluid retention, somnolence, hepatic dysfunction, and febrile episodes. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in all patients, but no serious infections or bleeding episodes were encountered. Steady state plasma ara-C concentrations of 20-60 microM were observed in patients treated at the 14 g/m2 dose, and were associated with plasma ara-U concentrations approaching 1 mM. Although no complete remissions were obtained at the ara-C dose levels tested to date, three partial remissions were noted, and the large majority of patients experienced a clearing of peripheral blood blasts. In addition, several patients who failed to achieve objective responses exhibited atypically benign clinical courses following completion of therapy. These findings demonstrate that 2'-deoxycytidine protects humans from otherwise lethal doses of high-dose ara-C administered by continuous infusion, and substantially ameliorates the hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity of such regimens without completely abrogating antileukemic activity. Determination of the ultimate efficacy of this strategy will require identification of an ara-C maximum tolerated dose and evaluation of the antileukemic potential of this regimen in prospective phase 11 trials.","['Grant, S', 'Baker, M', 'Bhalla, K']","['Grant S', 'Baker M', 'Bhalla K']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous/methods', 'Leukemia/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/prevention & control']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1933-8.,,,,,,['FD-R-000-367-01/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

With regard to the analysis of leukemia cells, the combined use of nuclear DNA content or TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) with other routine cellular markers is quite useful for the analysis of a small number of leukemia cells, and enables the differentiation of leukemia cells from the contaminating non-malignant cells, particularly in the analysis of the minimal residual diseases.

The lineage-derivation of CD7+ CD5- CD2- and CD7+ CD5+ CD2- lymphoid blasts was investigated based on the gene expression of CD3 epsilon, CD3 delta and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The former group included 4 categories; undifferentiated blasts without commitment to myeloid or T-lineage, T-lineage blasts with mRNA of CD3 epsilon, T/myeloid blasts with mRNA of CD3 epsilon and MPO and blasts with mRNA of MPO. The latter included 2 categories; T-lineage blasts with CD3 epsilon and CD3 delta mRNA and T/myeloid blasts with CD3 epsilon, CD3 delta and MPO mRNA. Thus, CD3 epsilon was expressed at a more immature stage than CD3 delta. The blasts at the pro-thymic stage were different from those at the thymic stage in several respects. The T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene showed a germ-line configuration in most pro-thymic blasts. The CD13/CD33, CD11b and class II MHC antigens were expressed very frequently in the pro-thymic stage. The CD21 antigen was most selectively expressed at the thymic stage. Pro-thymic blasts were of RA type of CD45 antigen, while thymic blasts were of RO type. Recombination activation gene-1 (RAG-1) was only limitedly expressed at the pro-thymic stage, but was highly expressed at the thymic stage.

Plasma beta-D-glycan levels, the differences between the levels determined toxicolor test and in endospecy test, were also investigated. Fourteen patients with systemic mycoses and 31 patients with suspected mycotic infections were treated with intravenous administration of FLCZ at a daily dose of 400 mg. Excellent to good responses were observed in 4 of the 14 patients (28.6%) with definitive diagnosis of mycosis, and in 18 of the 31 patients (58.1%) with suspected fungal infections, with an overall efficacy rate of 48.9% (22/45). Levels of plasma beta-D-glycan correlated well with efficacies of FLCZ in 19 of 30 patients. In several cases, however, plasma beta-D-glucan levels were low during the entire course of treatment. Even in 10 cases of definite mycosis, 4 cases showed low levels of plasma beta-D-glucan (below 15 pg/ml by repeated determinations). The results indicate that FLCZ is an effective agent for the treatment of severe systemic fungal infections in patients with hematologic disorders.

We observed that the WH subline, but not the CC/84 subline, of BJAB cells were infectible by cell-free HTLV-I or HTLV-II and formed syncytia with cells infected by these retroviruses. This suggests that the BJAB-CC/84 cells possibly lack a membrane molecule(s) important for syncytium formation and infectibility. In order to identify this antigen, we generated polyclonal anti-BJAB-WH antisera which were adsorbed on BJAB-CC/84 cells. The adsorbed antisera bound only BJAB-WH and BJAB-CC/79 cells as demonstrated by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and flow cytometric assays. Furthermore, this adsorbed antisera bound several human T-cell clones, including SupT-1, as determined by flow cytometric assays. The adsorbed antiserum was monospecific as it immunoprecipitated only one 78- to 80-kDa protein from lysates of metabolically labeled BJAB-WH, BJAB-CC/79, and SupT-1, but not BJAB-CC/84, cells. The monospecific antisera detected a glycoprotein composed of a 64- to 66-kDa core protein containing tunicamycin-sensitive N-linked oligosaccharides. This membrane glycoprotein appears to be involved in HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-induced fusion and infection, as the monospecific antisera were capable of inhibiting both of these processes. The monospecific antisera diluted 1:50 and 1:90 inhibited 85 to 90% of syncytium formation induced in BJAB-WH, BJAB-CC/79, and SupT-1 cells cultured with HTLV-I- or HTLV-II-infected MT2, MoT, or FLW human T- or B-cell lines. At the same dilution, antisera inhibited 70 to 80% of infection of BJAB-WH cells by cell-free HTLV-I or HTLV-II.

Virus disruption was achieved by several methods: osmotic shock, freezing-thawing cycles, and exposure to urea up to 4 M, to NaCl up to 1 M, and to Triton X-100. Several components associated with broken Moloney murine leukemia virus were repeatedly found in preparations. These components have been described as rings, thick filaments, chain-like filaments, threads covered with proteins, threads with buckles, and naked threads. A quantitative analysis of the occurrence of these components has been carried out. Among them, the thick filaments composed of a compact helical arrangement of small beads 5 nm in diameter were considered to represent the nucleocapsid. The protease-sensitive buckles found on some threads could be a compact form of the viral RNA associated to the nucleocapsid protein NCp10. The RNase-sensitive naked threads are interpreted as the deproteinized viral RNA itself. The ubiquitous chain-like filaments possess a periodic structure identical to that of polymerized type VI collagen. It is proposed that this adhesive protein is associated with the viral envelope taken from the cell membrane during the budding process of retroviruses.","['Pager, J', 'Coulaud, D', 'Delain, E']","['Pager J', 'Coulaud D', 'Delain E']","['Laboratoire de Microscopie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, URA 147 du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Suspensions)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.64 (Endopeptidase K)']",IM,"['Capsid/*ultrastructure', 'Collagen/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endopeptidase K', 'Freezing', 'Gene Products, gag/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'RNA, Viral/ultrastructure', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Suspensions', 'Urea/pharmacology', 'Viral Core Proteins/ultrastructure']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.1.223-232.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jan;68(1):223-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.1.223-232.1994.,,,,PMC236281,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The susceptibility to giant cell formation varied with the cell lines tested. Cocultivation of irradiated 3201/FIV cells with MT-2 cells resulted in giant cell formation as early as 2 h in culture, with striking resemblance to that induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). MT-4 cells (HTLV-I positive) and H9 cells (HTLV-I negative) were less susceptible than MT-2 to the induction of syncytia. MOLT-4 cells (HTLV-I negative) had intermediate sensitivity to syncytia formation. No syncytia were observed in the monocytic cell line U-937 (HTLV-I negative). Syncytia formation between 3201/FIV and MT-2 cells was inhibited by polyclonal cat anti-FIV antisera but not polyclonal cat anti-feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antisera, goat anti-FeLV, uninfected specific-pathogen-free cat serum, human anti-HTLV-I antisera, or normal human and goat serum. Concentrated cell-free FIV supernatant from 3201/FIV also induced giant cells of MT-2 cells that were indistinguishable from those induced by cocultivation. Giant cells and extensive cell killing associated with giant cell formation declined and disappeared within 10 days. Surviving cells appeared to be of normal size and grew continuously without expressing FIV antigen or releasing infective virus. Although Southern blot analysis using probes specific for FIV could not detect proviral DNA in any of the five human cell lines cocultured with irradiated 3201/FIV cells, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique detected FIV-specific DNA in MOLT-4 cells. DNA from the FIV-PCR positive MOLT-4 cells was PCR negative for endogenous FeLV-specific sequences, indicating that the MOLT-4 cell DNA was not contaminated with DNA from feline cells (i.e., 3201 cells). The FIV-MOLT-4 cells remained PCR positive for FIV after 40 passages, suggesting stable integration in the human cell line. These findings indicate that FIV is capable of forming proviral DNA in human T-lymphoid cells by cocultivation, although this FIV-carrying human cell line failed to produce replication-competent viruses.","['Tochikura, T S', 'Tanabe-Tochikura, A', 'Hayes, K A', 'Lazo, A', 'Bailer, R T', 'Blakeslee, J R Jr', 'Lafrado, L J', 'Roy-Burman, P', 'Pandey, R', 'Olsen, R G']","['Tochikura TS', 'Tanabe-Tochikura A', 'Hayes KA', 'Lazo A', 'Bailer RT', 'Blakeslee JR Jr', 'Lafrado LJ', 'Roy-Burman P', 'Pandey R', 'Olsen RG', 'et al.']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cats', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Giant Cells/cytology/*microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Virus Replication']",1993/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1993 Dec;6(12):1301-10.,,,,,,"['5 P30 CA 16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI-62525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-56295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In order to study this phenomenon, the T-cell line Jurkat E6-1 was treated continuously in vitro with low, gradually increased, concentrations of azidothymidine (AZT). Initially, 1 microM AZT significantly retarded the cell line from reaching confluence. However, after 10 weeks the T-cell line was able to grow in 10 microM AZT without any evidence of growth inhibition. Subsequently, cell isolates could grow continuously in the presence of 20, 50, and 100 microM AZT without growth inhibition. These T-cell lines (Jurkat E6-1/AZT-10, Jurkat E6-1/AZT-20, Jurkat E6-1/AZT-50, and Jurkat E6-1/AZT-100) were tested for AZT anabolism using purified [3H]AZT, and the results were compared to the wild-type untreated Jurkat E6-1 cell line. Similar intracellular AZT anabolites concentrations were determined in all cell lines. However, a four- to sixfold lower cellular concentration of mono-, di-, and triphosphate anabolites of AZT was determined in the Jurkat E6-1/AZT-10 cell line after 1 microM AZT incubation and 6.5-fold lower after 10 microM AZT treatment. In general, a five- to sixfold reduction in the phosphorylation rates were estimated in the AZT resistant T-cell line. Pharmacology studies of [3H]AZT in the Jurkat E6-1/AZT-100 cell line showed a much lower level of activation of the pro-drug (28-fold), due to lack of thymidine kinase (TK) activity when compared to the Jurkat E6-1/AZT-10 T-cell line. A similar level of resistance was obtained at the thymidylate (dTMP) kinase level. Concurrently an additional mode of resistance (407-fold) was seen on the incorporation of the AZT triphosphate anabolite (AZTTP) into cellular DNA. The formation of this cell line in a period of < or = 4 months coincides with the evidence of the clinical development of ""resistance"" to AZT in patients who receive the drug continuously. In addition, these T-cell lines have been infected with HIV, and studies on the development of collaterally sensitive regimens are under way.","['Avramis, V I', 'Kwock, R', 'Solorzano, M M', 'Gomperts, E']","['Avramis VI', 'Kwock R', 'Solorzano MM', 'Gomperts E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles 90027.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dideoxynucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6RGF96R053 (zidovudine triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dideoxynucleotides', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'HIV Infections/*drug therapy', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zidovudine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1993 Dec;6(12):1287-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells expressing the G protein-coupled m1 muscarinic receptor, Ag/IgE-induced cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI, calcium ionophore A23187, and carbachol through M1 receptors stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including two of 42 and 44 kDa. Proteins of identical molecular masses were recognized by anti-MAP-kinase antibodies, and these immunoreactive proteins exhibited in part a slightly increased molecular mass on SDS polyacrylamide gels after incubation of cells with secretory stimuli. All stimuli led to the activation of MAP kinase, which co-purified on Mono Q chromatography with 42- and 44-kDa proteins, which were tyrosine phosphorylated in response to secretory stimuli and reacted with anti-(MAP kinase) antibodies. Finally, 42- and 44-kDa proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-MAP-kinase antibodies and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-MAP-kinase antibodies, respectively. Primarily threonine and tyrosine residues were found to be phosphorylated in 42- and 44-kDa proteins immunoprecipitated from [32P]phosphate-labeled cells that had been treated with secretory stimuli. The dose dependence of secretagogue-induced MAP kinase activation correlated with that of increases in serotonin release from activated cells, and the maximum of MAP kinase activation coincided with the maximum rate of secretion. Down-regulation or inhibition of protein kinase C as well as incubation of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein markedly inhibited MAP kinase activation in parallel with serotonin release. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases are activated in response to secretory stimuli and provide some evidence for a functional link between MAP kinase activation and signaling events leading to mediator release in RBL cells.","['Offermanns, S', 'Jones, S V', 'Bombien, E', 'Schultz, G']","['Offermanns S', 'Jones SV', 'Bombien E', 'Schultz G']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jan 1;152(1):250-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified an immunodominant CTL epitope that is expressed on MCF1233 MuLV-induced lymphomas of H-2b mice. C57BL/10 (B10) mice were immunized with an MCF1233-induced B10 B cell lymphoma, and tumor-specific CTL cultures were generated in vitro. These were tested for recognition of synthetic class I-binding MuLV peptides, selected for class I allele-specific motifs. One of 28 candidate peptides sensitized target cells for CTL recognition. This peptide seems to be an immuno-dominant epitope, because it was recognized by all independent CTL clones, isolated from the tumor-specific bulk culture. The epitope (KSPWFTTL) is derived from the MCF1233 MuLV envelope (env)-p15E region and is shared by all endogenous AKV types of MuLV. It has an optimal length of eight amino acids and is presented by the Kb H-2 class I molecule. Interestingly, Friend, Moloney, and Rauscher (FMR) types of MuLV are not recognized by MCF MuLV-directed CTL. The FMR env-p15E proteins have a single amino acid difference at the first position of the MCF1233 MuLV epitope (RSPWFTTL instead of KSPWFTTL). The corresponding FMR-encoded peptide bound class I H-2 Kb equally well as the MCF peptide, but it was poorly recognized by MCF1233 MuLV-specific CTL. Moreover, in the Rauscher MuLV-induced cell line RMA the FMr peptide seems not to be processed for recognition by CTL, which was illustrated by experiments with CTL elicited against this peptide. Altered TCR interaction as well as lack of processing thus may explain the type specificity of MCF1233 MuLV-directed CTL.","['Sijts, A J', 'Ossendorp, F', 'Mengede, E A', 'van den Elsen, P J', 'Melief, C J']","['Sijts AJ', 'Ossendorp F', 'Mengede EA', 'van den Elsen PJ', 'Melief CJ']","['Department of Immunohaematology, Academic Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jan 1;152(1):106-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective review of bone marrow aspirates from 35 patients presenting consecutively with MDS and from 20 patients with each of the following: normal marrow appearance (routine staging for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), polycythaemia rubra vera, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase. RESULTS: Sea blue histiocytes were present in the marrow in 12 of 35 cases of MDS and occurred in large numbers in three of these cases. Sea blue histiocytes varied in the degree of cytoplasmic granularity and some cells were intermediate in appearance between classic sea blue histiocytes and pseudo-Gaucher cells. Sea blue histiocyte granules additionally stained positively with Sudan black and periodic acid schiff. Sea blue histiocytes occurred only in the presence of marrow hypercellularity. Their presence did not correlate with FAB subtype, degree of dyserythropoeisis, or megakaryocyte numbers. No sea blue histiocytes were found in the normal marrow or polycythaemia cases. In ITP sea blue histiocytes were seen in two of 20 cases and in chronic myeloid leukaemia in eight of 20 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Sea blue histiocytes are a common cytological feature in the bone marrow of patients with MDS. As other disorders frequently associated with marrow sea blue histiocytes are relatively rare MDS is probably the most common cause of this phenomenon in a northern European population.","['Howard, M R', 'Kesteven, P J']","['Howard MR', 'Kesteven PJ']","['Department of Haematology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sea-Blue Histiocyte Syndrome/*etiology/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.46.11.1030 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1993 Nov;46(11):1030-2. doi: 10.1136/jcp.46.11.1030.,,,,PMC501688,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fasting cells arrested in G greatly increased their reduced glutathione (GSH) in response to growth factors. The rise in thiol began after several hours, peaked before DNA synthesis, and resulted from increased production. BCNU inactivated GSSG-R rapidly, and later retarded, doubled, and greatly prolonged GSH formation before stopping DNA synthesis. Pretreatment unlike post treatment with buthionine-S-R-sulfoximine (BSO) diminished BCNU's ability to block GSSG-R. Enzyme inhibition decreased with falling cellular GSH. In the leukemia system as in vivo, sequential BCNU-induced thiol alterations heralded delayed antiproliferative effects. Drug timing markedly affected both thiol and DNA syntheses. By destroying GSSG-R and delaying the upregulation of thiol synthesis while escalating GSH utilization and requirements, the nitrosourea created a striking and previously unrecognized window of vulnerability for GSH-dependent processes. During this period, altered GSH metabolism could contribute indirectly to BCNU's pleiotropic effects by interfering with DNA alkylation repair, glucose decarboxylation, deoxyribose formation, and possibly by influencing other aspects of proliferation. Acquired GSSG-R deficiency was also an early and sensitive marker for prodrug breakdown and activation.","['Frischer, H', 'Kennedy, E J', 'Chigurupati, R', 'Sivarajan, M']","['Frischer H', 'Kennedy EJ', 'Chigurupati R', 'Sivarajan M']","[""Department of Medicine (Hematology), Rush-Presbyterian-St-Luke's Medical Center, Rush University, Chicago, Illinois 60612.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116894 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Dec;92(6):2761-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI116894.,,,,PMC288475,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antagonists of calmodulin, trifluoperazine (TFP), W-7 (N-[6-aminohexyl]-5-chloro-1-naphthelenesulfonamide), or mellitin inhibited significantly polyamine Spd uptake in these cells. The translocation of calmodulin towards plasma membrane and a concomitant decrease in its contents in cytosol were directly correlated with the time course increases similar to that of Spd uptake, indicating that calmodulin is recruited towards plasma membrane during the Spd transport process. Diminution of free intracellular calcium, (Ca2+)i, by preincubating the cells in BAPTA (bis[2-amino-5-methylphenoxyl]-ethane-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetate) buffer inhibited Spd transport significantly. Addition of lanthanum (LAN), a molecule known to inhibit Ca2+ efflux via Ca(2+)-ATPase, curtailed Spd uptake by these cells. LAN inhibited Vmax, but not the Km, of Spd uptake, indicating that the former does not directly interact with the polyamine transporter; rather it regulates the transport process, probably via its action on Ca(2+)-ATPase. Calmodulin-stimulated uptake of 45Ca2+ by inside-out vesicles of K 562 cells, a measure of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. Furthermore, addition of LAN inhibited both basal and calmodulin-stimulated activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase. Thapsigargin (THAP), a molecule known to elevate (Ca2+)i due to its action on the endoplasmic reticulum, increased Spd transport whereas addition of LAN inhibited THAP-stimulated Spd transport activity. THAP increased free (Ca2+)i in these cells, and a pre-addition of LAN to these cells curtailed the THAP-stimulated increases of (Ca2+)i concentrations. Addition of Spd brought about elevations in (Ca2+)i contents. Caffeine also increased (Ca2+)i in these cells; however, it failed to stimulate significantly the Spd uptake process, indicating that (Ca2+)i which is involved in the regulation of polyamine transport pathways does not belong to the calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) pool. Replacement of Ca2+ from the incubation medium (i.e., 0% Ca2+) resulted in higher uptake activity as compared to that in 100% Ca2+ medium, demonstrating that in 100% Ca2+ medium the calcium efflux process is quickly compensated by calcium refilling/influx from the extracellular medium, while in 0% Ca2+ medium there is perpetual efflux of (Ca2+)i which contributes to higher Spd uptake process. The results of this study suggest that an increase in free (Ca2+)i and its release from the cells via Ca(2+)-ATPase, and concomitant activation of calmodulin, which controls Ca(2+)-pump activity, are involved in the regulation of the Spd uptake process in human leukemia cells.","['Khan, N A', 'Sezan, A', 'Quemener, V', 'Moulinoux, J P']","['Khan NA', 'Sezan A', 'Quemener V', 'Moulinoux JP']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rennes I, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Terpenes)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*metabolism', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lanthanum/pharmacology', 'Melitten/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041570308 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Dec;157(3):493-501. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041570308.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an experimental mouse model to evaluate the long-term effect of in vivo morphine administration during retrovirus-induced immune dysfunction. Mice were treated daily for 11 weeks with increasing doses of morphine. Morphine treatment produced a decrease in body weight and spleen cell number. Murine retrovirus infection provoked an increase in body weight due to enlargement of lymphoid organs, and an increase in the percentage and absolute number of CD4+ and Mac 1+ cells. Interestingly, retrovirus-infected mice that were also morphine-treated did not show the increase in the relative proportion of Mac 1+ cells. Moreover, under the experimental conditions of protein-malnutrition and morphine treatment potentiation of immune dysfunction by murine retrovirus infection was investigated. Retrovirus infection-induced splenocyte proliferation was partially regulated by morphine treatment. Splenocytes from retrovirus-infected mice presented a higher percentage of IL-2R+ cells and, lower levels of sIL-2R in splenocyte supernatants. Mitogen-stimulated splenocytes had a lower production of interferon-gamma as well as an increase in the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus morphine altered the immune system by down-regulating splenocyte proliferation, because retrovirus infection-induced splenocyte proliferation was partially regulated by morphine treatment. We also evaluated the effects of joint murine retrovirus infection and protein undernutrition on the thymus cell subsets. Retrovirus infection was associated with a decrease in the absolute number of Thy 1+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells per thymus with the CD8+ cell subset being the most affected. Moreover, retrovirus-infected mice presented a dramatic decrease in the percentage of double-positive (CD4+ CD8+) cells in the thymus as well as changes in its immunoarchitecture. While protein undernutrition alone did not produce further differences between infected versus non-infected, protein-undernourished, morphine treatment induced a greater decrease in thymocyte number than that seen in retrovirus- or morphine-treated animals alone.","['Lopez, M C', 'Chen, G J', 'Colombo, L L', 'Huang, D S', 'Darban, H R', 'Watzl, B', 'Watson, R R']","['Lopez MC', 'Chen GJ', 'Colombo LL', 'Huang DS', 'Darban HR', 'Watzl B', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, Arizona Health Sciences Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Morphine/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192-0561(93)90008-M [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(93)90008-m [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1993 Nov;15(8):909-18. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(93)90008-m.,,,,,,"['AA08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 04827/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The major objective of the study was to determine if exposure to PBB during the perinatal period, in addition to conventional exposure of animals for 2 years, enhances the sensitivity of the bioassay to identify the carcinogenic potential of this chemical. The studies were designed to determine the toxic and carcinogenic effects of dietary PBB in rats and mice receiving (i) perinatal exposure up to 8 weeks of age followed by control diet for 2 years, (ii) exposure for 2 years beginning at the age of 8 weeks, and (iii) combined perinatal/adult exposure to PBB (perinatal exposure to 8 weeks of age followed by adult exposure for 2 years). During the perinatal period, rats were exposed to PBB at dose levels ranging from 1 to 10 ppm and adult exposure concentrations ranged from 3 to 30 ppm in the diet. In the mice, the dose levels ranged from 3 to 30 ppm in both perinatal and adult exposure portions of the chronic studies. A total of eight dose groups (including controls) were used with 60 animals in each group. Liver was the major target organ of PBB toxicity. Perinatal exposure alone (through dietary administration of 10 ppm PBB to the dams) had no effect on the incidences of neoplasms in female F344/N rats, but in male rats, perinatal exposure was associated with a marginally increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas that may have been related to chemical administration. In male and female B6C3F1 mice, perinatal exposure to 30 ppm PBB resulted in significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. In adult-only dietary exposure studies, PBB was carcinogenic in male and female F344/N rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Combined perinatal and adult dietary exposure to PBB confirmed the findings of the adult-only exposures for the increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in rats and mice. In male rats, there were no enhancing effects of combined perinatal and adult exposure. However, perinatal exposure enhanced the susceptibility of female rats receiving adult exposure of 10 or 30 ppm to the induction of liver neoplasms. For male and female rats, a combined analysis of the incidences of leukemia in the adult-only, perinatal-only, and combined perinatal and adult exposure groups revealed an apparent association between increasing incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and exposure to PBB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Chhabra, R S', 'Bucher, J R', 'Haseman, J K', 'Elwell, M R', 'Kurtz, P J', 'Carlton, B D']","['Chhabra RS', 'Bucher JR', 'Haseman JK', 'Elwell MR', 'Kurtz PJ', 'Carlton BD']","['National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Fundam Appl Toxicol,Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology,8200838,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Polybrominated Biphenyls)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', '*Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polybrominated Biphenyls/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0272059083711218 [pii]', '10.1006/faat.1993.1121 [doi]']",ppublish,Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1993 Nov;21(4):451-60. doi: 10.1006/faat.1993.1121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, hLIF binds with higher affinity to the mLIF-R than does mLIF. In order to define the regions of the hLIF molecule responsible for species-specific interaction with the hLIF-R and for the unusual high-affinity binding to the mLIF-R, a series of 15 mouse/human LIF hybrids has been generated. Perhaps surprisingly, both of these properties mapped to the same region of the hLIF molecule. The predominant contribution was from residues in the loop linking the third and fourth helices, with lesser contributions from residues in the third helix and the loop connecting the second and third helices in the predicted three-dimensional structure. Since all chimeras retained full biological activity and receptor-binding activity on mouse cells, and there was little variation in the specific biological activity of the purified proteins, it can be concluded that the overall secondary and tertiary structures of each chimera were intact. This observation also implied that the primary binding sites on mLIF and hLIF for the mLIF-R were unaltered by inter-species domain swapping. Consequently, the site on the hLIF molecule that confers species-specific binding to the hLIF-R and higher affinity binding to the mLIF-R, must constitute an additional interaction site to that used by both mLIF and hLIF to bind to the mLIF-R. These studies define a maximum of 15 amino acid differences between hLIF and mLIF that are responsible for the different properties of these proteins.","['Owczarek, C M', 'Layton, M J', 'Metcalf, D', 'Lock, P', 'Willson, T A', 'Gough, N M', 'Nicola, N A']","['Owczarek CM', 'Layton MJ', 'Metcalf D', 'Lock P', 'Willson TA', 'Gough NM', 'Nicola NA']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Multimerization', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Sep;12(9):3487-95.,,,,PMC413625,,['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide has been shown to be an effective agent against Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and has gained wider use recently for first-line and salvage chemotherapy in cases of systemic LCH. METHODS: The authors report two patients with secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with a t(15;17) abnormality after chemotherapy that included etoposide for the treatment of LCH. RESULTS: Patient 1, a 6-year-old girl, had APL develop 11 months after cessation of therapy that included vinblastine, prednisolone, and etoposide (9600 mg/m2 in total dose) for LCH. Patient 2, a 3-year-old girl, had APL develop 9 months after cessation of therapy that included vincristine, methotrexate, prednisolone, cyclophosphamide (10,800 mg/m2), and etoposide (4800 mg/m2) for LCH. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have experience with four patients treated with etoposide for LCH and suggest that there is a predisposition to secondary APL with t(15;17) for patients with LCH treated with etoposide.

Decrease in the amount of HTLV-I proviral DNA revealed by the polymerase chain reaction method.,3614-7,"BACKGROUND: Oral administration of low-dose etoposide is known to be effective against various malignancies, including malignant lymphoma. However, the effectiveness of low-dose etoposide as a treatment for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) has not been established. METHODS: A 74-year-old woman with ATL in acute phase was treated by daily oral administration of low-dose etoposide (25 mg/m2). The authors assayed changes in the surface markers and the amount of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by using flow cytometry and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, respectively. RESULTS: Before treatment, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly were observed. In laboratory examination, the leukocyte count was 13.7 x 10(3)/microliters, with 65% abnormal lymphocytes. The percentages of CD3-, CD4-, and CD25-positive cells in PBMC were 84.4%, 84.4%, and 76.5%, respectively. The serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 1376 IU/l (normal range, less than 520 IU/l). After the initiation of treatment, lymph-adenopathy and hepatomegaly disappeared, and the serum LDH level was reduced to the normal level before the 20th day of the treatment. On the 55th day of the treatment, CD25-positive cells had virtually disappeared. In addition, the amount of the proviral DNA in PBMC was reduced to approximately one-tenth by this treatment.

The hallmark of CML is the translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that results in the chimeric BCR-ABL gene encoding p210BCR-ABL. The oncogenic potential of this protein has been validated, and it is believed that it contributes in a critical way to the initiation of CML. However, the secondary genetic forces responsible for the transition from the chronic state to the fully blastic stage are not clear. Evidence for chromosomal instability includes the clonal evolution which characterizes advanced CML. In regard to specific genetic aberrations, sporadic reports have shown alterations in H-RAS, c-MYC, retinoblastoma, and P53 genes, as well as production of p190BCR-ABL during the progression of CML. In addition, we have recently found evidence for excessive interleukin-1 beta production, acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner, in the more advanced stages of the disease. Taken together, current data suggest that multiple molecular pathways lead to disease progression, and that distinct subsets of genetic alterations exist in blast crisis patients.","['Wetzler, M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Wetzler M', 'Talpaz M', 'Estrov Z', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, abl', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309047863 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:47-50. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047863.,"['ABL', 'BCR', 'BCR-ABL', 'H-RAS', 'RAS', 'Rb', 'c-ABL', 'c-MYC', 'p53']",,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for this approach is based on two important findings. The first is that leukemic stem cells (operationally defined as Ph-positive long-term culture-initiating cells, or LTC-IC) are present in the marrow of many CML patients at relatively low levels by comparison to co-existing normal stem cells (i.e., Ph-negative LTC-IC). The second finding is that leukemic LTC-IC are selectively ""purged"" following their incubation in vitro for 10 days under LTC conditions. As a result, cultured CML marrow preparations show, on average, a 300-fold selection in favour of normal LTC-IC. However, there is considerable variation in the initial normal and leukemic LTC-IC content of marrow samples from different CML patients. Thus in only approximately one third of cases does the number of leukemic LTC-IC in the marrow decrease to undetectable levels within the first 10 days of culture with the number of co-existing normal LTC-IC remaining at or above 1/50th of the average value for normal marrow. We have now transplanted 22 such CML patients with 10 day cultured marrow autografts following their treatment with myeloablative therapy. Fifteen of these patients were in first chronic phase and 7 had more advanced disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J', 'Phillips, G L', 'Barnett, M J']","['Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ', 'Phillips GL', 'Barnett MJ']","['Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*transplantation', 'Forecasting', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309047896 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:259-63. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047896.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well established features of chronic phase CML are its origin in a pluripotent stem cell, a now well defined molecular genetic basis involving the creation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene and evidence of resultant abnormalities in the mechanisms that normally control primitive hemopoietic cell proliferation. We have recently shown how the long-term marrow culture system can be adapted to quantitate and characterize a very primitive cell type in normal blood and marrow samples, as well as their normal and leukemic counterparts in patients with CML. This system has also been used to dissect mechanisms of normal progenitor regulation and to identify specific anomalies affecting leukemic (CML) progenitors. Our studies show that cells detected by their ability to initiate long-term cultures (LTC) of leukemic cells (i.e., CML LTC-initiating cells or LTC-IC) are differently distributed between marrow and blood by comparison to LTC-IC in normal individuals and, although functionally similar in terms of the number and differentiation types of clonogenic cells they produce, CML LTC-IC exhibit defective self-maintenance. Phenotypically these primitive leukemic cells are heterogeneous; the majority display features of activated/proliferating cells but a significant proportion do not. We have also documented heterogeneity in primitive CML cell responses to two factors that specifically and reversibly arrest the cycling of primitive normal hemopoietic cells; i.e., TGF-beta and MIP-1 alpha, to which CML cells are normally responsive and abnormally unresponsive, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Eaves, C', 'Udomsakdi, C', 'Cashman, J', 'Barnett, M', 'Eaves, A']","['Eaves C', 'Udomsakdi C', 'Cashman J', 'Barnett M', 'Eaves A']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

Studies of this system and related systems in other laboratories have begun to yield insights into the pathophysiology of the human bcr/abl leukemias. The CML-like syndrome appears to be a consequence of infection of a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor target cell. The leukemic clone is difficult to transplant to secondary recipients, but undergoes evolution to acute leukemia. The P190 form of bcr/abl appears to be more potent in leukemogenesis than P210, but may also be associated with a CML-like picture upon infection of a multipotential target cell. There may be a spectrum of different chronic phase duration associated with different Bcr/Abl proteins, with bcr sequences influencing the rate of disease progression.

While until little time ago most of the evidence in favor of an immune antileukemia mechanism exerted by allo BMT in CML was indirect, based on the lack of GVL, there is now solid evidence of a positive type, based on the antileukemia effect of donor lymphocyte infusions in patients having relapsed after transplant. There are three lines of indirect clinical evidence for GVL in CML: they include the classical linkage between GVHD and reduced relapse rate, increased relapse rate after identical twin allografts, and increased relapse risk after effective GVHD prophylaxis, with T lymphocyte depletion in the foreground. The eradicating effects of donor lymphocyte infusions in relapsed patients are the ultimate demonstration that allogeneic immune competent cells are capable of recognizing and destroying the Ph-positive clone. However the frequency of irreversible aplasia indicates that donor lymphocytes act in the same way on residual host hematopoiesis, so that a second graft, without repeat conditioning, should be programmed for such cases.","['Marmont, A M']",['Marmont AM'],"[""II Division of Hematology, S.

Presently, a number of technical and biological problems do not allow to draw any definitive conclusion on the prognostic significance of Minimal Residual Disease detected by PCR. A positive PCR, particularly if observed late after BMT, leads to increase the frequency of cytogenetic examinations, but a therapeutic intervention is not justified. The criteria to define the cytogenetic relapse are not still established. Therefore it is difficult to interpret the reappearance of Ph-1 chromosome after BMT as disease recurrence invariably progressing towards the hematological phase. However, alpha-Interferon, donor buffy-coat infusion or their association should be considered in the treatment of patients for whom the cytogenetic relapse has been confirmed. The therapeutic approach to patients with hematological relapse is mainly depending on the phase of disease.

Related donor marrow transplantation therapy for patients in the chronic phase of CML results in 45-70% long-term, disease-free survival. Younger recipient age, transplant in chronic rather than advanced phase and transplant within one year of diagnosis provide a better outcome. Graft versus host disease (GVHD), pneumonia and systemic infections are commonly encountered complications. T-lymphocyte depletion of donor marrow reduces the incidences of acute and chronic graft versus host disease but is associated with a higher relapse rate and lower overall incidence of disease-free survival than use of non-T-depleted marrow. The use of HLA matched or one antigen mismatched unrelated donors allow successful marrow transplantation in approximately 30% of CML cases where a suitably matched related donor is not available. Unrelated donor marrow transplantation can provide stable engraftment in the majority of recipients and lead to leukemia-free survival in many cases. The beneficial effects of unrelated donor marrow transplantation are particularly apparent in young, chronic phase recipients and when performed using donor/recipient pairs identical at the HLA A, B and DR loci.

Alternative regimens of Busulfan (Bu) (16 mg/kg) and Cy (120 mg/kg) (Bu/Cy2) or Bu (16 mg/kg) and Cy (200 mg/kg) (Bu/Cy4) have more recently been employed. At least three studies of Bu/Cy2 or Bu/Cy4 have given encouraging results. Two ongoing randomized studies of Bu/Cy2 versus Cy2/TBI have shown no difference in the event free survival (EFS). In addition, two ongoing randomized studies of Bu/Cy4 versus Cy (200 mg/kg) plus TBI (Cy4/TBI) show no significant differences in EFS. It appears that Bu/Cy regimens are as effective as Cy/TBI regimens. The choice of one regimen over the other depends on matters other than therapeutic efficacy.","['Santos, G W']",['Santos GW'],"['Johns Hopkins Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21287.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Purging/adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', '*Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'United States/epidemiology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309047886 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:201-4. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047886.,,,,,26,['P01-CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen patients achieved complete hematologic remission (CHR) and 6 partial hematologic remission (PHR). Six patients achieved major cytogenetic response, 4 of them lost all Ph1 chromosome positive cells and 4 had minimal cytogenetic response. Frequency of relapse was high: 8 patients with CHR and 6 with PHR relapsed, but patients with major cytogenetic response did not relapse. Patients who had received prior therapy with busulphan had a higher remission rate but a lower quality of cytogenetic response. Escalation of Roferon to 12 million units per day in relapsing or nonresponding patients induced PHR in 2/7. Neutralizing anti-interferon antibodies occurred in 7 relapsing or nonresponding patients. The cytoreductive induction with hydroxyurea enhanced the hematologic remissions to a median of 6 weeks. Further studies should define the role of combination therapy in order to improve response and prevent relapses.","['Shtalrid, M', 'Lugassy, G', 'Rosensaft, J', 'Berrebi, A']","['Shtalrid M', 'Lugassy G', 'Rosensaft J', 'Berrebi A']","['Israeli CML Study Group, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibody Formation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309047885 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:193-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047885.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survival difference of about one year is expected between busulfan and hydroxyurea treated patients. Prospectively evaluated age, organomegaly related symptoms, Karnofsky index, extramedullary manifestations, number of erythroblasts and percent of circulating blasts proved to be of prognostic significance. A prognostic score (score 1) was determined which was superior to Sokal's score in the study population. 164 patients were randomized to receive IFN.

Reduction of the Ph-chromosome was observed in 13% of evaluable patients (10 of 75). In 4 patients complete cytogenetic remissions were observed, in three of these ongoing. Cytogenetic responders have a survival advantage. Interferon treated Philadelphia-negative CML patients have no survival disadvantage.

In this paper, we discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks of each approaches and report experimental evidences showing the feasibility of the second one in a murine lymphoid cell line (BaF3) expressing P210 upon retroviral transduction of the complete BCR-ABL cDNA. A retroviral vector was used to introduce selected antisense and sense sequences into this cell line, that P210 expression had rendered Interleukin-3 (IL3) independent. The antisense transcripts generated under the control of MoMLV promoter specifically killed BaF3 cells in the absence of IL3 and stably inhibited P210 expression. Retrovirally transduced antisense sequences can thus successfully achieve stable suppression of P210 and may be used to study further the mechanisms by which P210 is transforming cells. The effect on CML cell lines and fresh CML cells, in bone marrow cultures, remains to be investigated before considering this technique for in vitro selective suppression of Philadelphia-positive haematopoiesis.","['Lewalle, P', 'Martiat, P']","['Lewalle P', 'Martiat P']","['Department of Haematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309047877 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:139-43. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047877.,['BCR-ABL'],,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the aim of the present study to investigate at the cytogenetic level marrow-derived CML clonogenic cells fractionated on the basis of their ability to adhere to preformed, allogeneic, normal marrow-derived stromal layers. Mononuclear marrow cells from CML patients (n = 15) were incubated with mafosfamide (100 micrograms/ml) or control medium, seeded onto marrow stromal layers and allowed to adhere (3 hrs, 37 degrees C). Following a short-term liquid culture, the different cell fractions were harvested and incorporated in methylcellulose cultures. CFU-GM grown from these cultures were analyzed by single colony karyotyping. On direct cytogenetic analysis, the overall mean (+/- SD) percentage of Ph-negative metaphases was 7 +/- 20%. Following stroma adherence and shortterm suspension culture, the mean (+/- SD) percentages of Ph-negative clones were as follows: 33 +/- 25% for adherent CFU-GM, 59 +/- 40% for adherent, mafosfamide-treated CFU-GM, 12 +/- 16% for non-adherent CFU-GM, and 32 +/- 26% for non-adherent-mafosfamide-treated CFU-GM.

We have reviewed what is known and still unknown about some of the important properties of normal and leukemic stem cells and later progenitor cells that may be relevant to developing improved treatment strategies in the future. Clinical observations and experimental evidence strongly suggest that the major expansion of the CML population takes place in the intermediate and later maturation compartments rather than in the stem cell or early progenitor cell compartments. The expansion occurs slowly, probably taking several years to reach a trillion or more cells, at which time clinical symptoms begin to develop. The maturing leukemic progenitors do not have an increased proliferative rate, but they undergo one or more additional divisions and also live longer than comparable normal progenitors. Although no quantitative assay system is available to study the ultimate proliferative potential of human stem cells, indirect evidence suggests that the behavior of leukemic stem cells is not greatly different from that of normal stem cells. One important difference is that the leukemic stem cells (or early progenitor cells) do not curtail cell production until marrow cell densities are reached that are substantially higher than those at which normal stem cells cease production. Based on these and other considerations a possible future therapeutic strategy is suggested. Any successful treatment program for CML will probably depend on the inclusion of some type of specific drug(s) that will selectively affect leukemic progenitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Clarkson, B', 'Strife, A']","['Clarkson B', 'Strife A']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Remission Induction']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309047871 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:101-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047871.,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

No difference in disease-free survival was found between the treatment arms, but patients on the daunorubicin arm went into remission earlier. The overall remission rate was 87%, which is at least as good as in contemporary studies elsewhere; factors predictive of a lower remission rate were older age and higher WBC. For those who entered remission. WBC, age and sex were the most important prognostic factors. Time to achieve remission was not a significant factor after allowance was made for these.

To determine the prognostic significance of auer rods in RAEBt, we classified the 208 patients with RAEBt seen between 1973 and 1992 as (1) those having RAEBt solely on the basis of auer rods (RAEBta, n = 29), (2) those meeting blood or marrow blast criteria for RAEBt and also having auer rods (RAEBtpos, n = 40) or (3) those meeting blood or marrow blast criteria for RAEBt without having auer rods (RAEBtneg, n = 139). The RAEBta group had a higher survival probability than either of the other two groups. Within RAEBta, those patients who, without auer rods, would be considered RAEB by the FAB system (n = 19) had a higher probability of survival than patients with RAEB as conventionally defined. Furthermore, patients with RAEBtpos were more likely to live longer than those with RAEBtneg. The RAEBta, RAEBtpos and RAEBtneg groups were similar with regard to the usual haematologic parameters. However, patients with auer rods were more likely to have a normal karyotype and less likely to have prognostically unfavourable cytogenetic abnormalities. When analysis was performed within cytogenetic groups, the favourable prognostic impact of auer rods was still evident. Similarly, the favourable prognostic significance of auer rods was discernible both among patients who did not receive intensive therapy and those who received induction chemotherapy. The complete remission rate in auer rod positive patients was 77%, compared to 27% in those without auer rods. There were no differences in remission duration. Our results suggest that: (1) patients with auer rods without blood or bone marrow blast criteria for RAEBt should not be grouped with those patients with such criteria, and (2) patients with auer rods and other criteria for RAEBt have a higher complete remission rate following induction therapy of the type frequently reserved for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Seymour, J F', 'Estey, E H']","['Seymour JF', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.

Surface expression of the alpha chain alone leads to low affinity GM-CSF binding and of both subunits to high affinity binding; the beta chain is required for transducing a proliferative signal. Studies of GM-CSFR expression have concentrated largely on static events occurring under conditions of binding equilibrium. We have examined the dynamic regulation of high and low affinity GM-CSFR expression in neutrophils (1100 +/- 200 R/cell, KD 50 +/- 15 pM) and a GM-CSF dependent human leukaemic cell line, TF-1 (2000 +/- 450 R/cell KD 15 +/- 5 pM) and 8600 +/- 1150 R/cell KD 1.8 +/- 0.3 nM). The addition of GM-CSF to TF-1 cells (350 pM, 4 h at 37 degrees C) caused a reduction in subsequent binding of 125I-GM-CSF at low ligand concentration (100 pM) (following a low pH wash to remove surface bound ligand) to 16 +/- 4% and a reduction in binding at high ligand concentration (2 nM 125I-GM-CSF) to 36 +/- 9% of control. Scatchard analysis showed complete down-regulation of high affinity GM-CSFR and a significant reduction in low affinity GM-CSFR. In neutrophils, concentration-response curves of ligand induced receptor down-regulation at 37 degrees C showed that observed down-modulation was more than 10-fold greater than predicted by static equilibrium binding data and correlated closely with GM-CSF priming of the neutrophil respiratory burst. The addition of IL-3 to TF-1 cells at 37 degrees C reduced 100 pM 125I-GM-CSF binding to 18 +/- 4% and 2 nM 125I-GM-CSF binding to 46 +/- 5% of control. TF-1 cells, but not neutrophils, were able to re-express GM-CSFR following removal of GM-CSF from medium. TF-1 proliferation assays showed that pulsed GM-CSF (0.35-3.5 nM) for up to 4 h did not cause a significant increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation which required the continued presence of GM-CSF (control 2875 +/- 208 cpm, pulsed GM-CSF 5 ng/ml 4972 +/- 1344, continuous GM-CSF 5 ng/ml 17249 +/- 2982). Therefore, proliferation of TF-1 cells required the continued presence of GM-CSF at a time when there was no detectable surface high affinity GM-CSFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Khwaja, A', 'Carver, J', 'Jones, H M', 'Linch, D C']","['Khwaja A', 'Carver J', 'Jones HM', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/*physiology', 'Respiratory Burst/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb08643.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Sep;85(1):42-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb08643.x.,,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Overall survival curves, however--albeit better on the idarubicin arm--are still depressingly low. Nonetheless, even if the compound represents only an incremental improvement, it gives more patients the opportunity for more intensive postinduction therapy, such as bone marrow transplantation, or innovative approaches to eradicating minimal residual disease, such as the use of recombinant interleukin-2.

The lipopeptide (2S)-2-palmitoylamino-6-palmitoyloxymethyl-7-palmitoyloxy heptanoyl-SK4 (Pam3AhhSK4) and fMLP activated high-affinity GTPase, i.e. the enzymic activity of G-protein alpha-subunits, in HL-60 membranes in a time- and protein-dependent manner, but they had no effect on Mg(2+)-ATPase and Na+/K(+)-ATPase. Pam3AhhSK4 and fMLP increased Vmax. of GTP hydrolysis. Pam3AhhSK4 activated GTP hydrolysis with half-maximal and maximal effects at about 2 microM and 10 microM respectively. Other lipopeptides activated GTP hydrolysis as well. Lipopeptides were less effective than fMLP to activate GTPase. In membranes from PTX-treated cells, the stimulatory effects of lipopeptides and fMLP on GTPase were abolished. In N-ethylmaleimide-treated membranes, the relative stimulatory effect of Pam3AhhSK4 on GTP hydrolysis was enhanced, whereas that of fMLP was diminished. fMLP and Pam3AhhSK4 activated GTPase in an over-additive manner in N-ethylmaleimide-treated membranes. Unlike fMLP, Pam3AhhSK4 did not enhance incorporation of GTP azidoanilide into, and cholera-toxin-catalysed ADP-ribosylation of Gi-protein alpha-subunits in, HL-60 membranes and did not induce rises in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Pam3AhhSK4 and fMLP stimulated phosphatidic acid formation in a PTX-sensitive manner. Pam3AhhSK4 itself did not activate O2- formation, but potentiated the stimulatory effects of fMLP. Our data suggest that (i) lipopeptides activate the GTPase of Gi-proteins, (ii) lipopeptides and fMLP activate Gi-proteins differently, (iii) lipopeptides stimulate phospholipase D via Gi-proteins, and (iv) phosphatidic acid formation is not sufficient for activation of O2- formation.","['Klinker, J F', 'Hoer, A', 'Schwaner, I', 'Offermanns, S', 'Wenzel-Seifert, K', 'Seifert, R']","['Klinker JF', 'Hoer A', 'Schwaner I', 'Offermanns S', 'Wenzel-Seifert K', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2960245 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Nov 15;296 ( Pt 1):245-51. doi: 10.1042/bj2960245.,,,,PMC1137680,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several tumor-specific chromosome aberrations, mostly in the acute leukemias, have been characterized at a molecular level.","['Schneider, N R']",['Schneider NR'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9072.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1993 Dec;117(12):1220-4.,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A computerized database of all discharge records for 1969 to 1990 from a Veterans Affairs hospital. PATIENTS: 906 men with a discharge diagnosis of the Felty syndrome. MEASUREMENTS: Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) (ratios of observed-to-expected events) estimated the risk for specific cancers. Hospital records confirmed the diagnoses of the Felty syndrome and cancer. RESULTS: We observed a twofold increase in total cancer incidence (137 patients; SIR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.5). The risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (19 patients; SIR = 12.8, CI, 7.7 to 20.0) was much greater than the twofold increase in risk for lymphoma generally reported for rheumatoid arthritis. The risk for leukemia was increased but only within 5 years of the first hospitalization for the Felty syndrome, (13 patients; SIR = 7.67; CI, 4.1 to 13.1). CONCLUSION: The increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma after the Felty syndrome in our study is similar to the risk associated with the Sjogren syndrome and may reflect similar immunostimulatory mechanisms.","['Gridley, G', 'Klippel, J H', 'Hoover, R N', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Gridley G', 'Klippel JH', 'Hoover RN', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Felty Syndrome/*complications', 'Hospitals, Veterans', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1994/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-120-1-199401010-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1994 Jan 1;120(1):35-9. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-120-1-199401010-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the model of murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) caused by a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) that induces immunologic alterations with similarities to those accompanying human HIV infection to study aspects of concomitant infections. The MuLV infection was found to reactivate T. cruzi infection in C57Bl/10 mice, as indicated by elevated parasitemia and lymphocytic infiltration in the myocardium. The T cells from these animals did not respond to T. cruzi antigens (lymphocyte proliferation, interferon-gamma, or interleukin-2 [IL-2] production) but had increased levels of IL-10. Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibody was decreased but not absent in dually infected animals. In a second set of experiments, we infected MAIDS-resistant B6D2 mice with MuLV, followed by infection with T. cruzi. These animals had higher parasitemia than those infected with T. cruzi alone. More interestingly, only dually infected animals developed MAIDS. The present report describes the activation of T. cruzi infection by MuLV as well as the aggravation of MuLV infection by T. cruzi.

Several deficiencies are identified in these studies that make interpretation of the results uncertain, including poor characterization of exposures in qualitative and quantitative terms, the small numbers of deaths or cases, and short follow-up periods. Despite these weaknesses, we conclude that, when viewed collectively, the evidence strongly suggests that occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents are associated with an excess human cancer risk.

The underlying disease was gastric cancer in three patients, metastatic prostatic cancer in two, acute promyelocytic leukemia in two, and abdominal aortic aneurysm in one patient. In all eight patients, the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor level was reduced to less than 50% of normal, and plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex levels were increased. Immunoblotting of serum using an antifibrinogen antibody detected a 250 kDa protein (corresponding to fragments X or DY) in all eight patients. Fragment Y and D monomer were detected in seven of the eight patients, indicating the occurrence of systemic fibrinogenolysis. However, they were not detected in one patient with metastatic prostatic cancer. To determine whether or not fibrinogen degradation was also occurring in the patient without fragment Y, we characterized the 250 kDa protein in all eight patients. The protein was found to be fragment X in the metastatic prostatic cancer patient without fragment Y, while it was fragment DY in the other seven patients. Thus, systemic fibrinogenolysis was present in all eight patients. In the two patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, the level of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor gradually increased with the reduction of tumor size by treatment. Fragment X, fragment Y, and D monomer were not detected when the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor level exceeded 60% of normal in both patients. In the other six patients fragment Y and D monomer also disappeared when the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor level exceeded 60% of normal. These findings suggest that systemic fibrinogenolysis only occurs when the plasma levels of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor falls below 60% of normal due to activation of the fibrinolytic system by various pathological conditions.","['Okajima, K', 'Kohno, I', 'Soe, G', 'Okabe, H', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Binder, B R']","['Okajima K', 'Kohno I', 'Soe G', 'Okabe H', 'Takatsuki K', 'Binder BR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/complications/therapy', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/metabolism', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/*deficiency']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830450104 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Jan;45(1):16-24. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830450104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of CD45 and right-angle light scatter to gate on leukemic blasts in three-color analysis.,534-40,"This article describes a procedure for performing routine three-color flow cytometric analysis for acute leukemia on lysed whole bone marrow preparations. This technique uses the combination of CD45 intensity and right-angle light scatter (RALS) to distinguish leukemic cells from normal lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and nucleated red blood cells. On this display, leukemic cells occupy a unique blast region characterized by intermediate CD45 density and low RALS, which, in normal marrows, contains less than 5% of the total cells. This approach was applied to 39 cases of acute leukemia and 8 cases of myelodysplasia or myeloproliferative disorders. The estimate of blasts by flow cytometric analysis was correlated highly with morphologic leukemic cell counts over a wide range. Moreover, the pattern seen on the CD45-RALS display was different for different French-American-British subtypes of leukemia, suggesting that this pattern might be useful for categorization. When CD45-peridin chlorophyll alpha protein was combined with other pairs of fluorescein isothiocyanate- and phycoerythrin-conjugated reagents, it was possible to set an analysis window on the leukemic blasts and display dual-parameter (ie, green vs. red fluorescence) data regarding expression of two additional markers on the leukemic population. This gating strategy was superior to traditional forward-angle versus RALS displays in that it did a better job of isolating the leukemic cells analytically.","['Borowitz, M J', 'Guenther, K L', 'Shults, K E', 'Stelzer, G T']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Guenther KL', 'Shults KE', 'Stelzer GT']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/100.5.534 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Nov;100(5):534-40. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/100.5.534.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genotypic confirmation of clonal identity.,519-26,"The abrupt appearance of a high-grade tumor in patients with low-grade malignant lymphoma usually is associated with an accelerated clinical disease course. The high-grade lymphoma may take a variety of histologic forms and often, but not always, represents evolution of the original low-grade disease, as shown by immunophenotypic or immunogenotypic studies. The authors describe the transformation of a variety of low-grade B-cell neoplasms to high-grade tumors in four patients. The initial diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma in one patient each and low-grade follicular lymphoma in two patients. The high-grade tumors were classified as lymphoblastic lymphoma in one patient and small noncleaved cell lymphoma in two patients. The high-grade component manifests primarily in the peripheral blood as circulating blast-like cells consistent with large-cell lymphoma in the remaining patient. In each case, immunophenotypic studies showed identical monoclonal surface immunoglobulin expression on the low- and high-grade tumors. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and kappa light chain gene studies showed identical clonally rearranged bands in paired samples from three of the four patients, a finding indicative of clonal identity. Unexpectedly, dissimilar immunoglobulin light and heavy chain gene rearrangements were detected in the paired samples from one patient with previously diagnosed follicular lymphoma, making the relationship of the two tumors from this patient uncertain; however, additional Southern blot analysis of the bcl-2 gene showed identical rearrangements in both lesions. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction across the t(14;18) major breakpoint region in both tumors amplified nucleotide fragments of identical size, confirming the clonal identity of the low- and high-grade lymphomas despite the divergent immunoglobulin gene studies. These studies show that low-grade malignant lymphomas of small lymphocytic, mantle cell, or follicular small cleaved cell types may assume high-grade morphologic characteristics, that this change is the result of transformation of the preexisting low-grade malignant neoplasm, and that this progression, like typical Richter's syndrome, is associated with a dramatically accelerated clinical course. In addition, these studies confirm previous reports that disparate immunoglobulin light and heavy chain gene rearrangements are not necessarily an indicator of different cellular origins, and additional genotypic studies occasionally may be required to show the clonal identity of the cell population involved in these morphologic transformations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Traweek, S T', 'Liu, J', 'Johnson, R M', 'Winberg, C D', 'Rappaport, H']","['Traweek ST', 'Liu J', 'Johnson RM', 'Winberg CD', 'Rappaport H']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severity of Illness Index']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/100.5.519 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Nov;100(5):519-26. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/100.5.519.,['bcl-2'],,,,,['CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Incident childhood neoplasms observed in the Cagliari province (Sardinia--Italy) in 1974-1989 were registered. Expected cases of the most frequent childhood cancers were calculated for each town, based on the sex-and age-specific incidence rates in the province. RESULTS: An excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was observed in Carbonia, a town located in the SW part of the province. The risk was highest in 1983-85, when 7 cases occurred versus 0.8 expected (RR = 8.7; 95% C.I. = 4.6, 16.3). No spatial clustering of ALL cases was observed within the town. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher than expected incidence of childhood ALL was observed in the town of Carbonia in 1983-85. In alternative to chance, possible exposure to environmental pollutants from a near industrial settlement is discussed as the cause of the observed excess, but it is far to be proven. Other hypotheses, including a viral infection in a population with increased susceptibility, as suggested for new urban settlements, cannot be discarded.","['Cocco, P', 'Bernardinelli, L', 'Biddau, P', 'Montomoli, C', 'Murgia, G', 'Rapallo, M', 'Targhetta, R']","['Cocco P', 'Bernardinelli L', 'Biddau P', 'Montomoli C', 'Murgia G', 'Rapallo M', 'Targhetta R']","['Istituto di Medicina del Lavoro, Universita di Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",1993/08/31 00:00,1993/08/31 00:01,['1993/08/31 00:00'],"['1993/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Aug 31;79(4):244-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antileukemic effect of this treatment was directly demonstrated in 4 patients by the disappearance of Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases or the loss of detectable BCR-ABL transcripts by polymerase chain reaction. In 2 patients in whom cytogenetic or polymerase chain reaction analysis was not performed, a change in hemopoietic chimerism with recurrence of donor-type hemopoiesis was demonstrated. Two patients, both treated in advanced stages of hematological relapse after BMT, did not respond. However, severe side effects of the treatment were observed: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 5 patients. Two of these patients progressed to severe chronic GVHD and 1 patient ultimately died of this complication. GVHD occurred in 5 of the 6 responding patients; one patient responded without developing clinical symptoms of GVHD. Six patients developed bone marrow hypoplasia after IFN/BC treatment, and pancytopenia occurred in 4 patients. None of these 4 patients recovered spontaneously and 2 patients died of complications of pancytopenia (cerebral bleeding, infection). Our results demonstrate that treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia relapse with IFN and BC transfusions is highly effective in patients with relapse in chronic phase. The occurrence of GVHD and pancytopenia, however, resulted in a high treatment-associated morbidity and mortality. Whereas a response to treatment was observed in 1 patient without GVHD, indicating that GVHD and a graft-versus-leukemia effect may be clinically separable, bone marrow hypoplasia occurred in all responding patients.","['Hertenstein, B', 'Wiesneth, M', 'Novotny, J', 'Bunjes, D', 'Stefanic, M', 'Heinze, B', 'Hubner, G', 'Heimpel, H', 'Arnold, R']","['Hertenstein B', 'Wiesneth M', 'Novotny J', 'Bunjes D', 'Stefanic M', 'Heinze B', 'Hubner G', 'Heimpel H', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199311000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1993 Nov;56(5):1114-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199311000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the retroviral packaging signal, the ribozyme would be expected to colocalize with the lacZ-containing viral genomic RNA but not with the lacZ messenger RNA. The ribozyme was found to reduce the titer of infectious virus containing lacZ by 90 percent, but had no effect on translation of lacZ messenger RNA.

Thus, in contrast to shorter gene constructs, the globin genes of the beta-globin locus YAC are regulated like the chromosomal globin genes.

We generated mAbs against V beta protein of the TCR, showed that these mAbs stained approximately 1% of peripheral blood T cells, and further showed that the mAbs could stimulate proliferation of these T cells. We then characterized the mAbs by amplifying TCR cDNA derived from mAb-stimulated cells and sequencing the beta chain. All clones sequenced used the V beta 7.1 chain, proving conclusively that the mAbs generated were specific for V beta 7.1 subfamily.

In the present study a P2U receptor cDNA has been expressed in K-562 human leukemia cells, one of the few available mammalian cell lines that lacks an endogenous P2U receptor. In stably transfected cells, low micromolar concentrations of ATP or UTP activated the receptor, resulting in the mobilization of intracellular calcium but not the influx of extracellular calcium. A photoaffinity agonist of the P2U receptor, 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-[alpha-32P]triphosphate ([alpha-32P]BzATP), photolabeled several proteins in plasma membranes from the stable transfectant or from untransfected K-562 cells. The photolabeling of a 53-kDa protein was significantly greater in plasma membranes from the stable transfectant than from untransfected cells. A mutant receptor containing six consecutive histidine residues at its carboxyl terminus was constructed and used to verify that this 53-kDa protein was the P2U receptor. In plasma membranes from cells expressing the histidine-tagged P2U receptor, but not from cells expressing the wild-type receptor, a single [alpha-32P]BzATP-labeled protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa was retained on a Ni(2+)-charged Sepharose column, which binds many proteins containing a polyhistidine tag.

Such lesions may be derived from epithelial or nonepithelial cell populations. Many epithelial premalignant lesions can be identified by their confinement by a basement membrane. Mesenchymal, hematologic, and lymphoid premalignant lesions are difficult to recognize as most of these lesions have no defining morphologic features or anatomic boundary that identifies their premalignant nature. We have devised a classification for nonepithelial premalignant lesions, based on biologic behavior rather than morphology, that includes neoplastic lesions that have some but not all of the properties generally attributed to developed cancers. The five categories of nonepithelial premalignant lesions are: (a) lesions delimited by a basement membrane (e.g., melanoma in situ); (b) nonepithelial neoplasms having a low rate of metastasis (e.g., giant cell tumor of bone); (c) early forms of nonepithelial malignancy (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, patch stage); (d) indolent neoplasms that regularly progress to malignancies (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia); and (e) certain low-grade neoplasms derived from germ cells (e.g., Grade 1 immature teratoma). Formal classification of the nonepithelial premalignant lesions would allow the pathologist to diagnose these biologically distinct entities as something other than simply benign or malignant, and would direct tumor biologists to study the key molecular properties that control the premalignant phenotype.","['Seidman, J D', 'Berman, J J']","['Seidman JD', 'Berman JJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Basement Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Precancerous Conditions/*classification']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1993 Sep;6(5):544-54.,,,,,122,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty three children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) were treated with interferon alfa after the completion of chemotherapy of leukemias and lymphomas. In the majority of cases a disproportion between symptomless clinical course of the hepatitis B virus and the rate of its active replication was observed. Presence of HBsAg and high activity of polymerase DNA HBV (pDNA) were found in all children. In the course of a 6-month treatment with interferon in a dose of 3 mil IU/m2 of the body surface a gradual decrease of pDNA activity was observed. A statistically significant difference of mean values of pDNA before and right after the treatment was determined (p < 0.05). Tests performed 3 months after the completion of the therapy showed a repeated increase of pDNA activity. Boundary values of pDNA were observed in 5 children. Complete elimination of HBs and HBe antigens has not been achieved in any of the children. While analyzing the obtained results it has to be taken into consideration that there were numerous unfavourable prognostic factors determined in the studied group of children such as: coexisting malignant disease, undergone intensive chemotherapy, long period which has passed from the moment of HBV infection until the administration of the treatment with interferon, high activity of pDNA, scanty symptoms of inflammation process.

It was first described as a ""shrinkage necrosis"", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. During apoptosis the cell decrease in size, loose contact with neighboring cells, and loose specialized surface elements such as microvilli and cell-cell junctions. A shift of fluid out of the cells causes cytoplasm condensation, which is followed by convolution of the nuclear and cellular outlines. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove ""unwanted"" cells. Apoptosis is associated with prostate atrophy after castration or atrophy of the adrenal cortex and thymus after administration of glucocorticoids. Apoptosis is involved in elimination of CD4 T lymphocytes in the course of HIV infection. The interest in apoptosis in oncology stems from the fact that it occurs in tumors, spontaneously as well as triggered by different antitumor drugs, radiation or after withdraw of growth factors.

Southern blot analysis using probes for different regions of bcr mapped the translocation break near the 5'-side of bcr exon 4. Cloning, Southern blot analysis and restriction map analysis of both bcr fragments showed that the part of bcr 3'- to the translocation break moved to 11q13. Sequence analysis of the translocation junction on the Ph1 chromosome showed that the translocation break occurred 63 bp upstream of exon 4. Compared to the germline sequence, bcr sequence from the translocated partners showed deletion of seven basepairs at the site of translocation. A probe derived from the 5'-region of the clone isolated from the 11q- chromosome identified clonal rearrangements in the leukemic DNA. Restriction map and sequence analysis showed that this clone consisted of the 3'-half of the glutathione S-transferase Pi (GST-Pi) gene and the 3'-part of bcr. We identified two point mutations in the GST-Pi allele involved in translocation. Northern blot analysis showed that the GST-Pi gene was expressed in the leukemic cells at blast crisis but not at chronic phase; however, no fusion mRNA between GST-Pi and bcr was identified. We did not find any sequence homology between 11q13 DNA and 22q11 DNA around the translocation breakpoints; however, sequences homologous to ALU repeats were identified close to the sites of translocation breaks at 22q11 and 11q13. This study supports our hypothesis that variant Ph1 translocations may occur as primary cytogenetic changes similar to the classical Ph1 translocations.","['Koduru, P R', 'Goh, J C', 'Pergolizzi, R G', 'Lichtman, S M', 'Broome, J D']","['Koduru PR', 'Goh JC', 'Pergolizzi RG', 'Lichtman SM', 'Broome JD']","['Department of Laboratories, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Dec;8(12):3239-47.,"['BCR', 'GST-Pi']",,,,,['S07 RR05924/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

On one hand, activation of wild-type p53 by the temperature shift induced an apoptotic type of cell death which could be inhibited by interleukin-6 (IL-6) (E. Yonish-Rouach, D. Resnitzky, J. Lotem, L. Sachs, A. Kimchi, and M. Oren, Nature 352:345-347, 1991). On the other hand, as reported in this work, activated p53 complemented the antiproliferative effects of IL-6 in M1 cells. A shift to the permissive temperature concomitant with or early after IL-6 treatment imposed a novel pattern of cell cycle arrest in which about 95% of the cells were retained within a G0-like quiescent state. This phase was characterized by 2N DNA content and low RNA and protein content. On the molecular level, activation of wild-type p53 transrepressed the c-myc gene but not the cyclin A, D1, or D2 gene, which are all independently suppressed by IL-6 in M1 cells. To further analyze whether c-myc inhibition mediates or complements p53 effects, the p53-transfected M1 cells were infected with a retroviral vector expressing deregulated c-myc, refractory to p53 or IL-6 action. It was found that the process of cell death was not interrupted at all in these M1 c-myc-p53 double transfectants, suggesting that the transrepression of c-myc is not a major obligatory event mediating p53-induced cell death. In addition, some of the antiproliferative effects of activated p53, manifested in the presence of IL-6, could still be transmitted in the background of constitutive c-myc. Yet the context of deregulated c-myc interfered with the final accumulation of cells within a G0-like phase, suggesting complementary interactions between the outcome of p53 activation and of c-myc suppression in the control of cell cycle arrest.","['Levy, N', 'Yonish-Rouach, E', 'Oren, M', 'Kimchi, A']","['Levy N', 'Yonish-Rouach E', 'Oren M', 'Kimchi A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, Regulator/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Temperature', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*pharmacology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.12.7942-7952.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Dec;13(12):7942-52. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.12.7942-7952.1993.,,,,PMC364866,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that during this process, the expression of heme oxygenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, is induced. Treatment with TPA increases heme oxygenase mRNA in other myelomonocytic cell lines also, but not in cell lines of other lineages, such as HeLa cells. Increased heme oxygenase activity may represent one of the functions of activated macrophages, which sequestrate senescent erythrocytes and degrade heme derived from hemoglobin. This cell-type-specific induction by TPA treatment further investigated with respect to transcriptional regulation. We defined a cis-regulatory element, 5'-GTCATATGAC-3', located in the 5'-flanking region (positions -156 to -147) of the human heme oxygenase gene, which confers inducibility by TPA in THP-1 cells but not in HeLa cells. Nuclear proteins that bind to this element, which may be responsible for the cell specificity, were identified in THP-1 nuclear extracts.

Activation of the Abl transforming function has been shown to require two distinct domains of Bcr: domain 1 (Bcr amino acids 1 to 63) and domain 2 (Bcr amino acids 176 to 242). The amino acid sequence of domain 1 indicates that it may be a coiled-coil oligomerization domain. We show here that domain 1 of Bcr forms a homotetramer. Tetramerization of Bcr-Abl through Bcr domain 1 correlates with activation of the tyrosine kinase and F-actin-binding functions of Abl. Disruption of the coiled coil by insertional mutagenesis inactivates the oligomerization function as well as the ability of Bcr-Abl to transform Rat-1 fibroblasts or to abrogate interleukin-3 dependence in lymphoid cells.

In both instances, Northern (RNA) blotting analyses have suggested the presence of altered mdr3 transcripts in these cells, possibly originating from novel transcription initiation sites. The mechanisms underlying mdr3 overexpression in these cells have been investigated. In P388/VCR-10 cells, Southern blotting analyses together with genomic DNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing have demonstrated the presence of an intact mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) within the boundaries of intron 1 of mdr3. cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing indicated that this integration event results in the synthesis and overexpression of a hybrid MMTV-mdr3 mRNA which initiates within the U3 region of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) of the provirus. Consequently, this mRNA lacks the normal exon 1 of mdr3 but contains (i) MMTV LTR-derived sequences at its 5' end, (ii) a novel mdr3 exon, mapping within the boundaries of intron 1 downstream of the MMTV integration site and generated by alternative splicing, and (iii) an otherwise intact 3' portion of mdr3 starting at exon 2. A similar type of analysis of P388/ADM-2 cells revealed that mdr3 overexpression in these cells is associated with the integration of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) within an L1Md repetitive element, immediately upstream of mdr3. The IAP insertion results in the overexpression of hybrid IAP-mdr3 mRNA transcripts that initiate within the 3' LTR of the IAP and which contain IAP LTR-derived sequences at the 5' end spliced 14 nucleotides upstream of the normal exon 1 of mdr3. Taken together, these results indicate that independent retroviral insertions were the initial mutagenic event responsible for mdr3 overexpression and survival during drug selection of these cell lines. Amplification of the rearranged and activated mdr3 gene copy occurred during further selection for high-level drug resistance in P388/ADM-2 cells.","['Lepage, P', 'Devault, A', 'Gros, P']","['Lepage P', 'Devault A', 'Gros P']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia P388/*genetics', 'Lysogeny/genetics', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.12.7380-7392.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Dec;13(12):7380-92. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.12.7380-7392.1993.,['mdr3'],,,PMC364809,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the first of three DNA-binding repeats in c-Myb has been largely deleted during the genesis of the v-myb oncogenes of avian myeloblastosis virus and E26 avian leukemia virus. This finding suggests that the first DNA-binding repeat may have an important role in cell growth control. We demonstrate that truncation of the first DNA-binding repeat of c-Myb is sufficient for myeloid transformation in culture, but deletion of the N-terminal phosphorylation site and adjacent acidic region is not. Truncation of the first repeat decreases the ability of a Myb-VP16 fusion protein to trans activate the promoter of a Myb-inducible gene (mim-1) involved in differentiation. Moreover, truncation of the first repeat decreases the ability of the Myb protein to bind DNA both in vivo and in vitro.

Some cancers can also be the direct cause of fever. A total of 28 episodes of fever in 8 patients with cancer were studied. The diagnoses were: 3 patients with lung cancer, 1 patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 1 patient with kidney cancer, 2 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1 patient with Hodgkin's disease. Were included cancer diagnosed patients of any age and sex, with three or more episodes of fever of more than 37.5 C (with a case of 38.5 C or more) after having eliminated any infectious etiology or fever caused by drugs. Were not excluded any patients who had received whole blood or blood derivative transfusions, chemotherapy or antibiotic treatment up to 48 hs before the fever peak. The patients were given intramuscularly 500 mg of aspirin or 50 mg of indomethacin. The first response in the temperature curve was evaluated while checking the axillary temperature six hours after drug administration and 48 hs later if the fever persisted. The patients who were given aspirin at first, were then given indomethacin and vice versa, using the same criteria to evaluate the response. In patients treated with indomethacin the temperature diminished quickly and completely (Fig. 1), unlike the effect achieved with the use of aspirin (Fig. 2).

This MPO release was greatly augmented by Cytochalasin B (Cy B), but after the addition of Cy B the priming effects of GM-CSF became less obvious. Exposure to GM-CSF without FMLP did not enhance MPO release. Within whole blood, FMLP produced negligible MPO release, but priming with GM-CSF prior to FMLP always resulted in a significant increase in MPO release. Myelodysplastic neutrophils released similar amounts of MPO in response to FMLP, compared with control cells (3.4 +/- 0.8 mU/10(7) control cells compared to 2.7 +/- 0.3 mU/10(7) MDS cells, p > 0.05). Priming with GM-CSF produced an increase in FMLP-stimulated MPO release comparable with control cells.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cells (5 x 10(5)) were incubated with 100 microliters of the concentrated HTLV-I at 37 degrees C for 1 hour. After washing, the cells were reacted with anti-HTLV-I envelope monoclonal antibody (rat) for 30 minutes on ice and then stained with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin. The stained samples were analyzed on FACScan. Antibody-titration of the virus-binding inhibition was carried out by pretreatment of the virus with serially diluted sera. RESULTS: The specificity of the virus-binding was shown by dose-response relationship, kinetics of the binding, and temperature dependency. HTLV-I was absorbed onto a wide range of human cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes at various levels. Antibodies to inhibit the virus-binding were also quantitatively detected in sera from HTLV-I infected individuals, including asymptomatic carriers and patients with adult T cell leukemia or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, but not from healthy seronegative controls.

No detailed biological mechanism has been proposed, but a causal link is made plausible by evidence of systemic effects of cigarette smoke and the presence in cigarette smoke of chemicals that have been associated with leukemia risk. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate the leukemia risk associated with cigarette smoking in a multicenter case-control study of acute leukemias in adults. METHODS: Adults aged 18-79 with newly diagnosed leukemia were contacted to participate in this epidemiologic study when they entered a clinical trial to be treated under protocols sponsored by Cancer and Leukemia Group B. Smoking histories for 610 patients with acute leukemia and 618 population control subjects were obtained by telephone interviews. We examined bone marrow samples and classified patients by morphology of leukocyte precursor cells according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification system and, for 378 patients, by the presence or absence of specific clonal chromosome abnormalities. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for risk of leukemia associated with smoking cigarettes. ORs were adjusted for age, race, and sex. RESULTS: Smoking was associated with only a modest increase in risk for leukemia overall (adjusted OR = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89-1.44). However, among participants aged 60 and older, smoking was associated with a twofold increase in risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.17-3.28) and a threefold increase in risk for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (OR = 3.40; 95% CI = 0.97-11.9). Among older persons, risks increased with amount and duration of smoking. Smoking was associated with increased risk for AML classified as FAB type M2 at all ages, with ORs of 1.70 (95% CI = 1.00-2.90) for those younger than 60 and 3.50 (95% CI = 1.53-8.03) for those aged 60 and older. Smoking was also associated with ALL type L2 at all ages, with ORs of 1.72 (95% CI = 0.90-3.27) for those younger than 60 and 5.34 (95% CI = 1.03-27.6) for those who were older. Smoking was more common among patients with specific chromosome abnormalities in AML [-7 or 7q-, -Y, +13] and in ALL [t(9;22)(q34;q11)]. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risk for leukemia and may lead to leukemias of specific morphologic and chromosomal types. The association varies with age. IMPLICATION: Examining discrete subtypes of disease may permit more accurate assessment of risk. As standardized morphologic classification and cytogenetic and molecular evaluation of leukemia patients becomes more common, epidemiologic studies that take advantage of these advances will begin to contribute to the identification of additional risk factors and mechanisms in acute leukemia.","['Sandler, D P', 'Shore, D L', 'Anderson, J R', 'Davey, F R', 'Arthur, D', 'Mayer, R J', 'Silver, R T', 'Weiss, R B', 'Moore, J O', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Sandler DP', 'Shore DL', 'Anderson JR', 'Davey FR', 'Arthur D', 'Mayer RJ', 'Silver RT', 'Weiss RB', 'Moore JO', 'Schiffer CA', 'et al.']","['Environmental and Molecular Epidemiology Section, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, N.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.24.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Dec 15;85(24):1994-2003. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.24.1994.,,,,,,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The significant improvements accrued by the use of weight decay are demonstrated. We conclude that models built without attempting weight decay may not be reliable either for interpretation or extrapolation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with tAML and t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13;q22), or t(8;16)(p11;p13) from seven centers, along with 23 previously published cases, were studied. RESULTS: Twenty-six, 16, and six patients, respectively, had t(8;21), inv(16), and t(8;16). Prior cancer was a solid tumor in 27 cases, and a hematologic malignancy in all other patients. Five patients had received prior radiotherapy (RT) alone, and 43 had received prior chemotherapy with or without RT. Prior chemotherapy included a drug that directly reacts with DNA (alkylating agent or cisplatin) and/or an agent that targets topoisomerase II (ATTop, an anthracycline or derivative or, less often, epipodophyllotoxin) in most patients. The interval between prior tumor and diagnosis of tAML was less than 3 years in most cases, and only seven patients had a preleukemic phase of disease. Morphology was M2 AML for t(8;21), M4eo for inv(16), and M4 or M5 for t(8;16). Sixteen of 21 (76%), 12 of 14 (86%), and zero of four patients with t(8;21), inv(16), and t(8;16), respectively, achieved complete remission (CR) with intensive chemotherapy. The actuarial disease-free survival rate at 24 months was 47% and 54% in patients with t(8;21) and inv(16), respectively. CONCLUSION: Like other tAMLs with a karyotype specific of de novo AML [balanced 11q23 rearrangement or t(15;17)], tAMLs with t(8;21), inv(16), or t(8;16) are usually characterized by a short latent period, previous treatment often combining a drug that directly reacts with DNA and an ATTop, and absence of preleukemic phase. Hematologic characteristics and response to treatment are also identical to those of de novo AML with the same karyotypes.","['Quesnel, B', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Bjergaard, J P', 'Brault, P', 'Estey, E', 'Lai, J L', 'Tilly, H', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Quesnel B', 'Kantarjian H', 'Bjergaard JP', 'Brault P', 'Estey E', 'Lai JL', 'Tilly H', 'Stoppa AM', 'Archimbaud E', 'Harousseau JL', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Child', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*genetics', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.12.2370 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Dec;11(12):2370-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.12.2370.,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

High doses of chemotherapy are administered either alone or in combination with total body irradiation in an attempt to eradicate malignant cells. The treatment may be lethal to normal bone marrow function, but this toxicity is overcome by providing bone marrow from an external source. In allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow is obtained from an HLA identical family member or unrelated donor. In recent years the use of less well-matched donors has increased, thus expanding the use of this strategy to a larger patient population. The success rate of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been greatest in the treatment of haematopoietic malignancies. Patients with acute or chronic leukaemia have a 30-80 percent likelihood of being free of disease at 5 years following transplantation. The success rate depends on the stage of disease at the time of transplantation. Certain nonmalignant diseases have also been treated successfully with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. These include severe aplastic anaemia, inborn errors of metabolism, and other genetically determined diseases [Storb et al., 1986a, 1991; Lucarelli et al., 1990; Kirkpatrick et al., 1991]. With the availability of effective antiviral therapy, treatment and prophylaxis are available for HSV, CMV, and VZV.

One patient (the father) had adult T cell leukaemia (ATL), one (the mother) tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), and three (children) were healthy asymptomatic carriers. All five family members had identical tax nucleotide sequences as determined by direct sequencing of PCR products. This sequence was compared with tax gene sequences of an unrelated TSP patient of Afro-Caribbean origin, and of C8166 cells, and found to have one and seven nucleotide differences, respectively. At the amino acid level these three sequences differed from the HTLV-1 prototype Japanese strain (ATK-1). All sequence changes were clustered towards the 3' end of the gene. These data demonstrate the complete conservation of an HTLV-1 gene following, presumably, horizontal and vertical transmission of the virus. Clones of this gene showed more sequence variation within the TSP patient than the ATL patient, mostly consisting of point mutations; there was no conservation of mutations between the two individuals. These mutations occurred only in individual clones of the ATL patient whereas those of the TSP patient were found to be repeated in different clones. A tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response was observed in two asymptomatic carriers with low antibody titres, whereas none was detected in an individual with a high antibody level. No tax-specific sequence was identified which may have contributed to the apparently high degree of transmission from mother to children (three of five children tested) nor account for the differences between disease symptoms in the parents.","['Major, M E', 'Nightingale, S', 'Desselberger, U']","['Major ME', 'Nightingale S', 'Desselberger U']","['Regional Virus Laboratory, East Birmingham Hospital, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Conserved Sequence/*genetics', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/microbiology/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-74-11-2531 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1993 Nov;74 ( Pt 11):2531-7. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-74-11-2531.,['tax'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether GAP expression is required for the growth of human normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells, we used GAP antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to inhibit it and analyzed the effects of this inhibition on the colony-forming ability of nonadherent, T lymphocyte-depleted mononuclear cells and of highly purified progenitors (CD34+ MNC) obtained from the bone marrow and peripheral blood of healthy volunteers or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, bcr-abl-positive) patients. The acute myelogenous leukemia cell line MO7, the Philadelphia BV173 cell line, and the acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 and HL-60 cell lines were similarly examined. GAP antisense treatment inhibited colony formation from normal myelo-, erythro-, and megakaryopoietic progenitor cells as well as from CML progenitor cells. Proliferation of MO7 (growth factor-dependent) and BV173 (bcr-abl-dependent) cells, but not that of NB4 and HL-60 (growth factor-independent) cells, was also inhibited, even though a specific downregulation of GAP was observed in each cell line, as analyzed by either or both mRNA and protein expression. Stimulation of MO7 cells with hematopoietic growth factors increased the expression of GAP as well as the levels of active GTP-bound p21ras. Stimulation of GAP expression was inhibited upon GAP antisense treatment. These data indicate that p120 GAP is involved in human normal and leukemic hemopoiesis and strongly suggest that GAP is not only a p21ras inhibitor (signal terminator), but also a positive signal transducer.","['Skorski, T', 'Kanakaraj, P', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Ratajczak, M', 'Szczylik, C', 'Zon, G', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Gewirtz, A', 'Perussia, B', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Kanakaraj P', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Ratajczak M', 'Szczylik C', 'Zon G', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Gewirtz A', 'Perussia B', 'Calabretta B']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.178.6.1923 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Dec 1;178(6):1923-33. doi: 10.1084/jem.178.6.1923.,,,,PMC2191281,,"['CA-37155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA encoding C33 Ag had revealed that it belongs to the newly defined transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF). M38 Ag was detected on virtually all human cell lines and fresh leukocytes except for most granulocytes. It was also expressed on a mouse hybrid cell clone containing human chromosome 11q23-pter. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses identified a monomeric 26-kDa protein. The M38 epitope was dependent on S-S bonding. These characteristics were very similar to those reported for TAPA-1 (the target of antiproliferative antibody-1), which also belongs to TM4SF as C33 Ag. We therefore cloned the cDNA of human TAPA-1 and expressed it in COS cells. M38 indeed reacted with COS cells expressing human TAPA-1. We concluded that M38 Ag was identical to TAPA-1. To further investigate the biologic functions of C33 Ag and M38 Ag (TAPA-1) and their roles in HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation, molecules associated with these Ag were examined in T cells. Immunoprecipitation from surface-iodinated cell lysates revealed that proteins co-precipitated by C33 and M38 were mostly common including each other. Sequential immunoprecipitation-immunoblot experiments confirmed that C33 Ag and M38 Ag (TAPA-1) were associated with each other. The association was further confirmed in BHK cells doubly transfected with human cDNA for C33 Ag and TAPA-1. We extended similar analyses and found that C33 Ag and M38 Ag (TAPA-1) were regularly associated with CD4 or CD8. The association of these Ag on the cell surface was further supported by co-modulation of M38 Ag (TAPA-1), CD4 and CD8 with C33 Ag. This is the first time that a physical association between the members of TM4SF is demonstrated. Furthermore, the regular association of C33 Ag and M38 Ag (TAPA-1) with CD4 or CD8 might indicate that they play a role in expression and/or function of the CD4/CD8 co-receptor complex.","['Imai, T', 'Yoshie, O']","['Imai T', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Cd81 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cholic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)', 'QBP25342AG (3-((3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonium)-1-propanesulfonate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholic Acids/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tetraspanin 28', 'Transfection']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Dec 1;151(11):6470-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Kd for IL-8 itself and copy numbers for both receptors in transfected cells were comparable. Competition binding with 125I-labeled IL-8, however, showed large differences for several of the IL-8 mutants between alpha and beta receptors. The amino-terminal ELR sequence was important for IL-8 binding to the alpha receptor, but not sufficient for high affinity binding. Both rabbit IL-8 and MGSA share the ELR sequence with human IL-8, but compete poorly with it. The carboxyl terminus distal to amino acid 50 does not seem to mediate high affinity binding to the alpha receptor. A rabbit IL-8/human IL-8 chimera that differs in only eight amino acids from the human IL-8 sequence, was 150-fold lower in its affinity for the alpha receptor than human IL-8. In contrast, both the amino and carboxyl termini appear to be important for binding to the beta receptor. If the ELR sequence of IL-8 was substituted with alanines or if the carboxyl terminus distal to C50 was replaced with the MGSA sequence, a reduction occurred in binding competition. If both changes were introduced simultaneously, binding was abolished. Binding of MGSA was completely prevented by replacement of the ELR sequence with alanines. Ca2+ mobilization in HL60 cells transfected with the alpha or beta receptor was used to assess cell stimulation. The various mutant forms of IL-8 induced receptor activity with a pattern of sensitivity parallel to the competition binding affinities, indicating that both receptors are active.","['Schraufstatter, I U', 'Barritt, D S', 'Ma, M', 'Oades, Z G', 'Cochrane, C G']","['Schraufstatter IU', 'Barritt DS', 'Ma M', 'Oades ZG', 'Cochrane CG']","['Department of Immunology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CXCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL1', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Chemotactic Factors/*metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Interleukin-8/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Dec 1;151(11):6418-28.,,,,,,"['AI-27506/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-23584-15/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In Northern blot analysis human Met-ase (Hu-Met-1) cDNA hybridized with a 0.9-kb mRNA in two human NK leukemia cell lines, unstimulated human PBMC, and untreated purified CD3-CD56+ large granular lymphocytes. Unlike other members of the granzyme family that are highly expressed in activated peripheral T cells, the Hu-Met-1 transcript was barely detected in a population of PMA and ionomycin or IL-2-treated high density T cells. Several in vitro cultured Burkitt lymphomas, chronic- and promyeloid leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and colon and ovarian carcinomas and colon and ovarian carcinomas did not express Hu-Met-1 mRNA. Hu-Met-1 mRNA expression in a small number of human T cell tumor lines did not correlate with any particular phenotype or stage of development. The presence of Hu-Met-1 mRNA closely correlated with the Met-ase activity of cellular lysates prepared from these various human peripheral blood subsets and in vitro cultured cell lines. Met-ase activity detected in whole cell lysates of cytotoxic lymphocytes was associated with the cytoplasmic granules of these cells. The nucleotide sequence of the Hu-Met-1 cDNA clone encodes a predicted serine protease of 257 amino acids. The predicted protein is an active enzyme of 232 amino acids with a calculated unglycosylated m.w. of 27,100. Hu-Met-1 is 66% identical to RNK-Met-1 at the amino acid level. The human and rat mature protein sequences conserve the active site His, Asp, and Ser amino acids that form the catalytic triad of serine proteases, all 8 cysteine residues, and several amino acids critical in the formation of the substrate binding pocket.

Better results were obtained with media containing p-phenylenediamine (solutions in buffered glycerol, Vectashield, Fluorstop). However, Mowiol, Slowfade, n-propyl gallate (20 g/liter) were also effective in retarding fading. Most of them, except Mowiol, reduced fluorescence intensity. We concluded that the choice of anti-fading medium would depend on the desired results: a slower decay of fluorescence despite an initial quenching of fluorescence or a lower retardant effect with no decrease in initial fluorescence intensity.

Hyperthermia did not cause immediate cell death as determined by the trypan blue exclusion test, but did cause substantial decreases in the numbers of heated cells within 2 days. The density of the cells began to increase thereafter, which was consistent with the results of the experiments labeling the cells with 3H-TdR after hyperthermia. When the cells were heated at 39-43 degrees C for 1-3 hr and then interacted with various LAK cell/ATL cell (E/T) ratios at 37 degrees C for 4 hr, total cytolysis of the cells increased in a synergistic and/or additive manner over that of the cells without hyperthermia. Prolonged incubation of the cells at high temperature did not necessarily cause a large increase in the interaction of LAK cells after hyperthermia. This augmentation of cytolysis by LAK cells after hyperthermia was not seen in normal peripheral lymphocytes. These results suggest that the combination therapy of hyperthermia and LAK cells may be more specific, useful, and effective for treating malignant lymphoma.","['Nakayama, J', 'Toshitani, A', 'Hattori, T', 'Moroi, Y', 'Hori, Y']","['Nakayama J', 'Toshitani A', 'Hattori T', 'Moroi Y', 'Hori Y']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,,IM,"['*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1346-8138.1993.tb01321.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 1993 Aug;20(8):457-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.1993.tb01321.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive lymphoid lesions can mimic lymphoma clinically and histologically and have been designated pseudolymphomas. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to analyze lymphoid gene rearrangements in cutaneous lymphoproliferative lesions and to correlate these findings with the histologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical profile. METHODS: We examined 21 cases of lymphoproliferative lesions that developed in skin and performed molecular rearrangement analysis of T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes. We examined identical tissues by histologic and immunophenotypic criteria and conducted follow-up clinical evaluation of all patients. RESULTS: Clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin (seven cases) or T-cell receptor (two cases) gene were detected in 9 of 21 patients. No specific histologic or immunophenotypic feature was consistently associated with a clonal lymphoid gene rearrangement. Systemic lymphoma developed in one patient in whom a clonal rearrangement within the immunoglobulin gene was identified. CONCLUSION: Gene rearrangement analysis may be helpful in differentiating primary cutaneous lymphoma from pseudolymphoma. The chronic clinical course of patients with clonal lymphoid gene rearrangements supports a lack of correlation between clonality and biologic aggressiveness.","['Landa, N G', 'Zelickson, B D', 'Peters, M S', 'Muller, S A', 'Pittelkow, M R']","['Landa NG', 'Zelickson BD', 'Peters MS', 'Muller SA', 'Pittelkow MR']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0190-9622(93)70272-U [pii]', '10.1016/0190-9622(93)70272-u [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1993 Dec;29(6):945-53. doi: 10.1016/0190-9622(93)70272-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have modified a low-pressure strong anion-exchange column pre-step developed by others to concentrate and partially purify oxidized cell extracts while at the same time eluting them in a more compatible solvent for HPLC injection. The HPLC column is a YMC ODS-AQ column operating in a combined hydrophobic-interaction chromatography-reversed-phase chromatography mode. The injection and elution solvents are both phosphate-based.

To examine whether this plasticity extends to structural proteins, we cocultured hippocampal neurons and pituitary-derived neuroendocrine (AtT20) cells with astrocytes, kidney epithelial cells, or skeletal muscle cells. As a marker of phenotypic change we used the cytoskeletal protein peripherin, a type III intermediate filament (IF) subunit which is not expressed in hippocampal neurons and AtT20 cells. We show here that soluble factor(s) secreted specifically from skeletal muscle cells can induce the expression and de novo assembly of peripherin in a subset of post-mitotic neurons. We further demonstrate that one of these factors is the Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/Cholinergic Neuronal Differentiation Factor. The environmentally regulated expression of peripherin implies a remarkable degree of plasticity in the cytoskeletal organization of postmitotic CNS cells and provides a noninvasive model system to examine the de novo assembly of IF proteins under in vivo conditions.","['Djabali, K', 'Zissopoulou, A', 'de Hoop, M J', 'Georgatos, S D', 'Dotti, C G']","['Djabali K', 'Zissopoulou A', 'de Hoop MJ', 'Georgatos SD', 'Dotti CG']","['Cell Biology Program, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peripherins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Epithelium/physiology', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Growth Substances/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Hippocampus/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/cytology/*physiology', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Neuroglia/physiology', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Peripherins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.123.5.1197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1993 Dec;123(5):1197-206. doi: 10.1083/jcb.123.5.1197.,,,,PMC2119872,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both variants associated with endogenous beta 1 and were present at comparable levels on the surface of transfected K562 cells. After activation with phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMA) or the stimulatory anti-beta 1 antibody TS2/16, alpha 6A beta 1 as well as alpha 6B beta 1 mediated cell adhesion to laminin and more specifically to its fragment E8. Furthermore, both integrin variants interacted with the laminin isoforms kalinin and merosin. Cell adhesion to laminin isoforms was inhibited by the alpha 6-specific monoclonal antibody GoH3. PMA was less efficient in stimulating adhesion than TS2/16 and stimulated adhesion of alpha 6B transfectants better than of alpha 6A transfectants. In contrast, TS2/16 stimulated the adhesion of the alpha 6A and alpha 6B transfectants to laminin to a similar extent. These findings indicate that the cells may regulate the activation of the two alpha 6 variants independently. Activation by PMA was associated with the phosphorylation of both alpha 6A and alpha 6B subunits, but there was no relationship between the degree of phosphorylation and the ability of the transfectants to adhere to laminin since alpha 6A became phosphorylated much more strongly by PMA than alpha 6B. Thus, both alpha 6A beta 1 and alpha 6B beta 1 on K562 cells are activation-dependent receptors for different isoforms of laminin.","['Delwel, G O', 'Hogervorst, F', 'Kuikman, I', 'Paulsson, M', 'Timpl, R', 'Sonnenberg, A']","['Delwel GO', 'Hogervorst F', 'Kuikman I', 'Paulsson M', 'Timpl R', 'Sonnenberg A']","['The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Cell Biology, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (kalinin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/05 00:00,1993/12/05 00:01,['1993/12/05 00:00'],"['1993/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)74468-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Dec 5;268(34):25865-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among clinical features, only age and leukocyte count remain prognostically important. Immunophenotyping is useful for ALL classification and for assignment to specific therapy regimens, but, with the possible exception of CD10 expression, has little prognostic importance in the context of contemporary phenotype- and risk-directed therapy. Cytogenetic features are useful for risk assignment. Hyperdiploidy > 50 chromosomes is associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas Ph+ chromosome and t(4;11) confer an adverse prognosis. Pre-B cases with the t(1;19) do not fare well with antimetabolite-based therapy and should be treated with additional classes of chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, certain specific rearrangements such as dic(9;12) may in fact be associated with favorable prognosis. With the exception of treatment for B-cell ALL (and perhaps transitional pre-B ALL), phenotype- or genotype-directed therapies have not been successfully devised. Selection of treatment for individual patients, therefore, should be based on their estimated risk of failure. For patients with very high-risk leukemia (i.e., those with > 70% likelihood of treatment failure), the use of experimental therapeutic strategies, despite the potential for acute and long-term disabilities, may be justified. For the subset of children in the lower-risk category (< 20% probability of failure), antimetabolite-based therapy should be employed to minimize long-term sequelae.","['Ribeiro, R C', 'Pui, C H']","['Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1993;7(3):121-42.,,,,,99,"['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The radiation sensitivity of primary clonogenic blasts from 74 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was analyzed using leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) assays. Primary bone marrow blasts from all 74 patients were exposed to ionizing radiation and subsequently assayed for LPC-derived blast colony formation. Radiation survival curves of primary clonogenic blasts (i.e., LPC) were constructed for each of the newly diagnosed patients using computer programs for the single-hit multitarget as well as the linear quadratic models of cell survival. RESULTS: A marked interpatient variation in intrinsic radiation sensitivity was observed between LPC populations. The SF2 values ranged from 0.01 to 1.00 (median: 0.36; mean +/- SE = 0.40 +/- 0.03), and the alpha values ranged from 0.00 Gy-1 to 3.27 Gy-1 (median: 0.280 Gy-1; mean +/- SE = 0.43 +/- 0.09 Gy-1). Patients were divided into groups according to their sex, age, WBC at diagnosis, cell cycle distribution of leukemic blasts, and immunophenotype. Only immunophenotype provided a significant correlation with the intrinsic radiation sensitivity of LPC. Patients with B-lineage ALL had higher SF2 (0.47 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.05, p < 0.05) and smaller alpha values (0.43 +/- 0.09 Gy-1 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.10 Gy-1, p < 0.05) than T-lineage ALL patients, consistent with greater intrinsic radiation resistance at the level of LPC. Notably, 43% of B-lineage ALL cases, but only 27% of T-lineage ALL cases had LPC with SF2 > or = 0.5. Similarly, 66% of B-lineage ALL cases, but only 37% of T-lineage ALL cases had LPC with alpha values < or = 0.4 Gy-1. Combining the two indicators of radiation resistance, we found that only 34% of the B-lineage ALL patients had none of the two parameters in the respective critical regions (alpha < or = 0.4 Gy-1; SF2 > or = 0.5), while 63% of the T-lineage patients had none (p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, the immunophenotypic B-lineage affiliation was the only significant predictor of radiation resistance at the level of LPC. Whether alone or in combination, none of the other variables examined, including sex, age, WBC, in vitro plating efficiency, S-phase index, and proliferation index were significantly correlated with the radiation sensitivity or resistance of LPC. CONCLUSION: These results offer unprecedented evidence for an association between composite immunophenotype (viz., B-lineage ALL vs T-lineage ALL) and radiation resistance that may form a basis for modifying radiation conditioning regimens.","['Uckun, F M', 'Aeppli, D', 'Song, C W']","['Uckun FM', 'Aeppli D', 'Song CW']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Radiation Tolerance/*physiology']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(93)90466-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(93)90466-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Nov 15;27(4):899-906. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(93)90466-9.,,,,,,['R01 CA 42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

They were originally associated with the ability of retroviruses to cause tumors in animals. These viral oncogenes (V-onc) have their cellular counterparts (C-onc) called Proto oncogenes. Function of Proto oncogenes is to maintain cellular growth and development. Activation of these proto-oncogenes can occur due to mutation which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. The Proto oncogenes can be grouped into different categories based on their protein products, i.e. protein kinases, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and DNA binding proteins. There are also genes that normally suppress malignant transformation and these are called anti oncogenes. Loss of their suppressor activity leads to unimpeded growth. Oncogene abnormalities are seen in pediatric leukemias, lymphomas, and various solid tumors. Anti oncogenes are associated with retinoblastoma (Rb gene), Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma, etc. Identification of these abnormalities have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. The utility of oncogenes in classification of human cancer and monitoring cancer therapy is quite clear, but the future of these for therapeutic interventions remains uncertain. Role of c-abl oncogene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), bcl-2, in lymphomas, N-myc in neuroblastomas and retinoblastoma (Rb) gene in retinoblastomas is well understood and used in designing proper therapeutic approaches. Since oncogenes also control normal cellular function, their use for therapy may be limited by the amount of damage to normal cells. Their maximum therapeutic benefit may be realized only when used in combination with other modalities.","['Vats, T S', 'Emami, A']","['Vats TS', 'Emami A']","['University of Kansas Medical Centre, Kansas City 66160-7357.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Child', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/*physiology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02822176 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 1993 Mar-Apr;60(2):193-201. doi: 10.1007/BF02822176.,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we cloned the genes coding for two Group F MAbs (F11-35 and F11-39) and deduced the amino acid sequences of the variable regions for their heavy and light chains. The variable region for the heavy chain of F11-35 contained a possible N-glycosylation site (Asn/Asp/Thr) at amino acid positions 89-91. Then, we constructed two mouse-human chimeric antibodies by using the F11-35 and F11-39 variable region genes of heavy and light chains (VH and V kappa) and human heavy and light chain constant region genes (gamma 1 and kappa) derived from a human plasma cell leukemia line (ARH77). The chimeric gene constructs were sequentially co-transfected into murine non-Ig-producing myeloma (P3-U1) or hybridoma (Sp2/0) cells by electroporation. The resulting chimeric heavy chain of F11-35 showed a slightly but significantly higher molecular weight than that of F11-39, but the molecular weights of their unglycosylated peptides synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin were similar, indicating the glycosylation at the possible N-glycosylation site in the variable region of the Ch F11-35 heavy chain. Both chimeric antibodies exhibited the same specificity and affinity for CEA as those of the parental murine hybridoma antibodies, respectively. Ascites production of Sp2/0 transfectomas is sufficiently high (600-900 micrograms/ml) for initial clinical studies with the chimeric antibodies.","['Arakawa, F', 'Haruno, M', 'Kuroki, M', 'Kanda, H', 'Watanabe, T', 'Misumi, Y', 'Matsuoka, Y']","['Arakawa F', 'Haruno M', 'Kuroki M', 'Kanda H', 'Watanabe T', 'Misumi Y', 'Matsuoka Y']","['First Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Constant Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/*immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Regions/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1993.12.365 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1993 Aug;12(4):365-79. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1993.12.365.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, the enzyme is found on early B-lineage cells and certain stromal cells of the bone marrow and thymus. This ectopeptidase is also expressed by capillary endothelial cells, placenta, and epithelial cells of the intestine and proximal renal tubules. Here we have used a mouse E-AP cDNA to identify the human counterpart in a kidney library. Sequence comparison of the human and mouse cDNAs reveals approximately 80% homology at both nucleotide and predicted amino acid levels. The nucleotide sequence of human E-AP predicts a type II integral membrane protein of 957 amino acids with an 18-amino-acid aminoterminal intracellular domain, and a 22-amino-acid transmembrane domain. The large extracellular carboxyterminal domain contains the zinc-binding motif typical of zinc-dependent metallohydrolases. When the human E-AP cDNA was placed downstream of the SR alpha promoter in an expression vector and transfected into COS-7 cells, the transfected cells exhibited cell surface E-AP activity. A 4.1-kb transcript could be detected in a variety of human tissues, including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. However, in representative lymphoid leukemias, E-AP transcripts were restricted to pre-B leukemia and were not found in T- and B-cell leukemias.

The new technique uses a pair of consensus primers for variable (VH) and joining (JH) regions. We first tested the accuracy of this new approach on a broad series of 67 samples that had been well characterized by both Southern blot and immunohistochemical techniques before being subjected to blind testing. Our results show that this technique gave 100% specificity (absence of false-positive results) and approximately 70% sensitivity (30% false-negative results). The only exception was the presence of an IgH polymerase chain reaction ambiguous result in a case of Sezary's syndrome. The polymerase chain reaction technique was then applied to a panel of 27 frozen gastric endoscopy biopsy specimens following previous clinical suspicion of lymphoma. Monoclonality was detected in nine of 13 samples previously diagnosed as lymphomas and in one of two carcinomas. Further examination of the gastrectomy specimen in the latter case disclosed a B-cell lymphoma associated with the carcinoma. In spite of its limited sensitivity, the high specificity attained by this technique in the detection of monoclonality makes it a useful adjunct to routine morphologic criteria, as it is sometimes capable of detecting true positive cases that conventional morphology studies show to be negative.","['Algara, P', 'Martinez, P', 'Sanchez, L', 'Villuendas, R', 'Benitez, J', 'Rivas, C', 'Piris, M A']","['Algara P', 'Martinez P', 'Sanchez L', 'Villuendas R', 'Benitez J', 'Rivas C', 'Piris MA']","['Department of Genetics, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Stomach/*pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0046-8177(93)90214-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(93)90214-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1993 Nov;24(11):1184-8. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(93)90214-2.,['IgH'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When HL60 cells were induced by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to terminally differentiate, a rapid drop in the level of c-myc mRNA was observed, followed by an arrest of cell proliferation. In contrast, the level of topoisomerase II mRNA was transiently increased with a maximum at 6 h after DMSO addition and was then completely abolished after 48 h, indicating that topoisomerase II is activated during the onset of HL60 differentiation. In exponentially growing cells, treatment by mAMSA results in the formation of topoisomerase II-mediated double strand DNA breaks in the c-myc gene at positions where topoisomerase II would normally nick and reseal the two strands. In HL60 cells treated with both mAMSA and DMSO, the sites in the c-myc gene at which mAMSA had induced cleavage were not altered. However, a DNA cleavage site located at the end of the first c-myc exon (position +3100), was strongly stimulated by mAMSA and DMSO treatment. This site fell within a DNase I hypersensitive region encompassing the MYC intron factor 1 (MIF1) binding site, where transcription elongation is normally blocked during differentiation. These data indicate that a change of topoisomerase II binding to critical regulatory region of the c-myc gene is associated with the downregulation of this gene during differentiation.","['Riou, J F', 'Gabillot, M', 'Riou, G']","['Riou JF', 'Gabillot M', 'Riou G']","['Rhone-Poulenc Rorer SA.

This enhanced cytotoxicity was confirmed by the evaluation of [3H]AZT incorporation into cellular DNA, that was increased by 50% and 222% in the presence of alpha- and gamma-IFN, respectively. The addition of 50 mumol/l thymidine to the culture medium was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of the drug combinations to the degree observed with each compound alone; furthermore, the increased incorporation of AZT into DNA was completely reversed. These data indicate the existence of a biochemical interaction between AZT and IFNs that results in an increased cytotoxic effect.

Lower concentrations of 4-HC (10, 20, or 50 microM/L) failed to cause this effect, while higher concentrations (> or = 200 microM/L) produced random DNA fragmentation. 4-HC-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was associated with a marked induction in c-jun and significant reductions in bcl-2 and c-myc oncogene expressions. A combined treatment with interleukin-3 (IL-3) plus IL-6 for 18 hours before an additional, 1-hour concurrent treatment with 4-HC (100 microM/L) significantly increased 4-HC-induced DNA fragmentation as well as colony growth inhibition of HL60 cells.

By a functional, morphologic, and flow-cytometric approach, we have studied monocyte/macrophage- and cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity against U937 cells, a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line. A rapid decrease in cell viability of U937 cells (MTT assay) could be observed at an effector-to-target cell (E:T) ratio of 10 in the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma-activated monocytes. Light and electron microscopic examination showed the characteristic features of apoptosis of U937 cells after incubation with either monocytes or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis (10(4) U/mL) as measured by multiparameter flow cytometry (propidium iodide [PI]) paralleled the functional decrease in cell viability (MTT assay) of 20 +/- 3% after 24 hours up to a maximum of 50 +/- 4% after 48 hours. Apoptosis could be confirmed by the detection of DNA degradation into multiples of 200-bp subunits by agarose gel electrophoresis. After prolonged incubation times, monocyte-mediated leukemic cell death could be quantified as apoptosis by flow cytometry, whereas no decrease in net cell viability of tumor cells relative to the initial cell number could be observed by MTT spectrophotometry. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that apoptosis is the major mode of TNF-alpha-dependent monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against U937 cells. Furthermore, multiparameter flow-cytometric analysis offers a sensitive method to quantify cytokine- and cell-induced apoptosis in leukemia.","['van de Loosdrecht, A A', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Beelen, R H', 'Broekhoven, M G', 'Drager, A M', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Beelen RH', 'Broekhoven MG', 'Drager AM', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Department of Hematology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Dec;21(13):1628-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblotting analysis of lysates from both the parental HL60 and PMA-resistant HL525 cells revealed expression of alpha-, beta-, delta- and zeta-PKC isoforms. Diminished expression of delta-PKC was observed along with increased expression of zeta-PKC in HL525 cells. Lysates from HL60 cells were resolved into the following 4 peaks of PKC activity using hydroxylapatite: peak 1, beta; peak 2, delta; peak 3, alpha; and peak 4, zeta. A similar elution pattern was noted for PKC isoforms expressed in HL525 cells although no peak 2-delta activity was recovered. PMA treatment of HL60 cells abolished activity of peaks 2, 3, 4; diminished alpha-PKC and increased zeta-PKC expression. In contrast, PMA treatment of HL525 cells did not abolish activity of peaks 1, 3 or 4, compared with the parental HL60 cells and failed to stimulate changes in zeta-PKC isoform expression. These data suggest that the inability of PMA to induce differentiation of HL525 cells may reside in diminished expression of delta-PKC along with alterations in zeta-PKC. The findings support the hypothesis that differential expression of PKC isoforms in HL525 cells contributes to the lack of morphological changes in response to PMA. The data also demonstrate that PMA alters the level of histone-dependent phosphotransferase activity as well as PKC cofactor dependence.","['Wooten, M W', 'Seibenhener, M L', 'Soh, Y']","['Wooten MW', 'Seibenhener ML', 'Soh Y']","['Department of Zoology, Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, Auburn University 36849.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytobios,Cytobios,0207227,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis/chemistry/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cytobios. 1993;76(304):19-29.,,,,,,['CA-49637/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the role of peroxidase activation in the formation of DNA adducts by HQ and p-BQ in HL-60 cells, human bone marrow (HBM) cells, mouse bone marrow macrophages (MBMM) and the U-937 and Raji leukemia cell lines. Adduct formation was measured by P1-enhanced 32P-postlabeling; peroxidase activity was measured with a spectrophotometric assay. Treatment with p-BQ resulted in the formation of two DNA adducts in all of the cell lines. The DNA adducts were identical in all of the cells, however, the adduct level varied by 80-fold. Treatment with HQ produced one DNA adduct in HL-60 cells, HBM and MBMM; no adducts were detected in U-937 or Raji cells. The HQ-DNA adducts in the three cell lines were identical. The adduct level was highest in the HL-60 cells, followed by HBM and MBMM. There was a statistically significant correlation between peroxidase activity and the formation of HQ-DNA adducts. These results suggest that peroxidase-mediated metabolism is involved in the activation of HQ to form DNA adducts in mouse bone marrow and HBM.","['Levay, G', 'Ross, D', 'Bodell, W J']","['Levay G', 'Ross D', 'Bodell WJ']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism', 'Biotransformation', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Peroxidases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.11.2329 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 Nov;14(11):2329-34. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.11.2329.,,,,,,"['ES04112/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Of these patients 1672 were receiving home parenteral nutrition and 1296 were receiving home enteral nutrition. The outcomes of these active cancer patients are compared to those of 123 radiation enteritis (""cured"" cancer) and 480 Crohn's disease patients receiving home parenteral nutrition and 918 noncancer dysphagic patients receiving home enteral nutrition. This longitudinal clinical information was reported to the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Patient Registry between 1985 and 1990. Evidence indicates that the number of home parenteral and enteral nutrition patients has increased nationally by about 25% each year between 1989 and 1990. In a subsample of 37 home nutrition support programs that have consistently reported their data to the registry since 1985, more than 90% of their program growth was accounted for by new patients with active cancer. This is now the largest single diagnosis of patients starting home parenteral and enteral nutrition. The mean survival time of cancer patients is 6 months after starting home parenteral and enteral nutrition, but 25% live beyond a year and 20% resume full oral nutrition. Although most active cancer patients experience only partial rehabilitation, for those patients with longer survival, rehabilitation is more complete. The outcome is relatively better for children and for patients whose neoplasm is leukemia, lymphoma, small bowel, or liver. In comparison, 96% of home parenteral nutrition Crohn's patients, 80% of home parenteral nutrition radiation enteritis patients, and 60% of home enteral nutrition noncancer dysphagic patients survive at least 1 year. Adult active cancer home parenteral and enteral nutrition patients do not have a greater incidence of therapy-related readmissions than other patient groups, however, their overall rehospitalization rate is much more frequent. This article discusses factors that may have contributed to this growth in home nutrition support in active cancer patients.

METHODS: Three patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency and late-onset angioedema were studied to establish the presence and to characterize the nature of any underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. RESULTS: Each of the patients was found to have a low-grade B-lineage lymphoma. In one patient, the underlying disorder, best characterized as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, was occult initially. The other two patients had splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and small lymphocytic lymphoma, respectively. Two of the patients had an immunoglobulin M (IgM) serum paraprotein with cold agglutinin activity; the third patient had no paraprotein, but his cells expressed monoclonal membrane IgM. Two of the patients initially did not require specific anti-lymphoma therapy and responded to therapy with an attenuated androgen; in the third patient, splenectomy and cytotoxic chemotherapy led to resolution of the acquired angioedema. In all three patient, there was considerable delay in diagnosis consequent to lack of awareness of this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a neoplasm of B-lymphocytes was established eventually in all three patients, although in one patient it was occult initially. In each case, the lymphocytes were mature B-lymphocytes that either showed cytologic evidence of plasma cell differentiation or secreted a paraprotein. Underlying lymphoma is common in patients who are seen initially with late-onset angioedema. Angioedema is an important, potentially life-threatening complication of lymphoma. Optimal patient management requires that both angioedema and the underlying lymphoma are recognized.","['Bain, B J', 'Catovsky, D', 'Ewan, P W']","['Bain BJ', 'Catovsky D', 'Ewan PW']","[""Department of Haematology, St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, England.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Complement C4)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Angioedema/*diagnosis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins/analysis', 'Complement C3/analysis', 'Complement C4/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931201)72:11<3318::aid-cncr2820721130>3.0.co;2-n [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Dec 1;72(11):3318-22. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931201)72:11<3318::aid-cncr2820721130>3.0.co;2-n.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effectiveness of surgical resection.,3223-6,"BACKGROUND: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with neutropenia. Two severe complications with poor outcome can be observed after apparently successful IPA medical treatment: severe hemoptysis and IPA relapse during subsequent cytotoxic treatments. Early surgical therapy has not been considered routinely in the management of localized IPA. METHODS: Six consecutive patients (four women, two men; median age, 52 years) with localized cavitating IPA diagnosed during chemotherapy-induced aplasia were treated with early surgical resection after hematologic recovery. RESULTS: All patients received a lobectomy. Surgery was uneventful. This procedures allows patients to proceed with further intensive chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation without IPA reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: For selected patients, surgical resection of localized IPA with unique cavitating lesion, which prevents hemoptysis and IPA recurrence and allows for subsequent cytotoxic treatment, may be recommended.","['Moreau, P', 'Zahar, J R', 'Milpied, N', 'Baron, O', 'Mahe, B', 'Wu, D', 'Germaud, P', 'Despins, P', 'Delajartre, A Y', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Moreau P', 'Zahar JR', 'Milpied N', 'Baron O', 'Mahe B', 'Wu D', 'Germaud P', 'Despins P', 'Delajartre AY', 'Harousseau JL']","['Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Pneumonectomy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931201)72:11<3223::aid-cncr2820721115>3.0.co;2-r [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Dec 1;72(11):3223-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931201)72:11<3223::aid-cncr2820721115>3.0.co;2-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One possibility involves the secondary activation of natural killer (NK) cells by cytokines released during the GVHD process. To evaluate this possibility we have compared NK activity and lymphokine-activated killer cell precursor (LAKp) frequencies in serially sampled PBMC from recipients of unmanipulated autologous or allogeneic marrow with and without active GVHD. NK activity recovered rapidly after BMT and was elevated during episodes of acute GVHD. However, NK activity did not differ between recipients of autologous or allogeneic marrow without GVHD nor was NK activity increased in association with chronic GVHD. Endogenously-activated NK cells were detected only in recipients of allogeneic marrow but this did not correlate with GVHD status. In contrast to NK activity, LAKp frequencies fell below the control range during the first 8 weeks after BMT. By 9-14 weeks the median LAKp frequency was normal and did not differ between the three groups then or later after transplant. We conclude that acute GVHD may serve to increase the lytic activity of NK cells but does not result in increased LAKp. LAKp frequencies are below normal during the first two months after BMT, a finding not previously recognized from bulk culture LAK studies. The role of LAK effectors in GVL may involve more the degree of cellular activation rather than the number of cells activated.","['Keever, C A', 'Klein, J', 'Leong, N', 'Copelan, E A', 'Avalos, B R', 'Kapoor, N', 'Cunningham, I', 'Tutschka, P J']","['Keever CA', 'Klein J', 'Leong N', 'Copelan EA', 'Avalos BR', 'Kapoor N', 'Cunningham I', 'Tutschka PJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Ohio State University, Columbus.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/surgery', 'Recurrence']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Sep;12(3):289-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous marrow was treated in vitro with J5 and J2 monoclonal antibodies (CD10/CD9) plus rabbit complement to purge residual ALL cells. Twenty-two adults with B lineage ALL were treated with high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by infusion of J2/J5 purged autologous BM. The median age was 28 years (range 18-54 years). Twenty-one of 22 patients had experienced at least one relapse prior to BMT. All patients achieved complete hematologic engraftment. Disease-free survival (DFS) in this cohort of patients was 20%, with all survivors alive and free of disease between 2.5 and 7.5 years post-BMT. Age at the time of BMT was an important prognostic factor, with patients < 28 years old faring much better than older individuals (DFS, 45% vs 0%, p = 0.01). Our experience suggests that high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by infusion of J2/J5 purged autologous marrow is as efficacious in young adults as it is in children and is a reasonable alternative for patients who lack HLA-matched donors. Results in older adults are poor, however, and demonstrate the need for more effective transplant strategies in these individuals.","['Soiffer, R J', 'Roy, D C', 'Gonin, R', 'Murray, C', 'Anderson, K C', 'Freedman, A S', 'Rabinowe, S N', 'Robertson, M J', 'Spector, N', 'Pesek, K']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Roy DC', 'Gonin R', 'Murray C', 'Anderson KC', 'Freedman AS', 'Rabinowe SN', 'Robertson MJ', 'Spector N', 'Pesek K', 'et al.']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Neprilysin/*immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Sep;12(3):243-51.,,,,,,"['CA 55207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to BMT, seven patients had minimal residual pulmonary lesions. All patients received amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg/day) during the aplastic period prior to engraftment. One patient died of Gram-negative septic shock before engraftment. Seven patients achieved complete hematological engraftment without any evidence of IPA reactivation. Amphotericin B was well tolerated with only minimal transient renal dysfunction in three patients. Later pulmonary complications related to IPA were observed in only one patient who developed a self-limited episode of hemoptysis. One patient died of CMV pneumonitis and two of leukemia relapse. Four patients survive disease-free and without complications related to IPA.

DESIGN: Retrospective birth cohort study. SETTING: Cumbria, West Cumbria health district, and Seascale civil parish. SUBJECTS: The 10,363 children born in Cumbria during 1950-89 to fathers employed at Sellafield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The doses of external whole body ionising radiation received by fathers at Sellafield in the total time and in the six months before conception of their children; the proportions of the collective doses associated with Seascale and the rest of West Cumbria. RESULTS: 9256 children were born to fathers who had been exposed to radiation before the child's conception. Of these, 7318 had fathers who were exposed in the six months before conception. Overall 7% (38 person-Sv) of the collective total preconceptional dose and 7% (3 person-Sv) of the collective dose for the six months before conception were associated with children born in Seascale. Of all the children whose fathers worked at Sellafield, 842 (8%) were born in Seascale.

DESIGN: Case-control study with eight matched controls per case. SETTING: Regions of Ontario, Canada, with an operating nuclear facility. SUBJECTS: Cases were children (age 0-14) who died from or were diagnosed as having leukaemia from 1950 to 1988 and were born to mothers living in the vicinity of an operating nuclear facility. Controls were identified from birth certificates, matched by date of birth and residence at birth. There were 112 cases and 890 controls.

Clinical trials in patients stratified according to risk factors are useful to determine the efficacy of different treatments. These advances currently allow treatment of CLL patients to be decided on a more rational basis. Patients in early clinical stage (Binet A, Rai 0) with non-diffuse bone marrow histopathology, and low, stable blood lymphocyte levels have a long survival and should not be treated unless the disease progresses. On the contrary, patients with poor prognostic features, such as advanced clinical stage (Binet B, C; Rai III, IV), diffuse bone marrow infiltration or high and rapidly increasing blood lymphocyte levels have a median survival inferior to 5 years and should be treated. Chlorambucil is still the mainstay for treatment of CLL but new agents such as fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine offer great promise. These agents are already the treatment of choice for patients failing standard therapies and its role as front-line therapy is being investigated in randomized trials. Whatever the treatment used, however, cure is rarely achieved. A number of situations (e.g. autoimmune cytopenias, hypersplenism) merit special treatment approaches (e.g. corticosteroids, splenectomy). Bone marrow transplants, albeit experimental in CLL, warrant investigation in younger patients with poor prognosis.","['Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Postgraduate School of Haematology Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy', 'Splenectomy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(93)90003-M [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(93)90003-m [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1993 Sep;7(3):164-75. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(93)90003-m.,,,,,130,,,,,,,,,,,,

While 27 of 29 treated patients (93%) without p53 mutations achieved a partial remission, only one of seven treated patients (14%) with p53 mutations achieved a partial remission (P = .00009). Adjusting for prognostic factors (age, sex, race, and Rai stage), patients with p53 gene mutations had a 13-fold greater risk of death than patients without p53 mutations (P = .013). In addition to examining the clinical relevance of p53 gene mutations in B-CLL, we investigated the possible role of p53 gene regulation in the expression of the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and MDR3. We quantitated MDR1 and MDR3 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of both the MDR1 and MDR3 genes was independent of p53 gene mutation or prior drug treatment, and did not predict for clinical response.

The occurrence of the del(20q) in a broad spectrum of myeloid disorders suggests that the loss of genetic material on 20q could provide a proliferative advantage to myeloid cells, possibly through the loss of a tumor-suppressor gene. We have examined a series of patients with the del(20q) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with unique sequence probes that map along the length of 20q, and have delineated a segment that is deleted in 95% of all patients examined (18 of 19). In addition, we have shown that the deletions are interstitial rather than terminal.

The major protein substrates are a 73-kD protein and a protein migrating near ovalbumin on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 47-kD protein was partially purified from cells harvested by leukapheresis from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. This partially purified ion-exchange fraction contained an endogenous kinase activity with characteristics similar to those we previously described of protein kinase P (protein kinase, phospholipid-stimulable: PK-P), but not typical of any form of protein kinase C (PK-C). With longer phosphorylation, the 47-kD band showed increasingly lower mobility demonstrable both by Coomassie blue staining and autoradiography, suggesting both that it was multiply phosphorylated, and that the excisable band was pure. The protein was thus eluted from preparative gel slices and digested with endoproteinase lys C. Sequence data from the fragments identified the protein as the 47-kD calpain fragment of talin, a protein found in focal adhesion plaques and some cell-cell contacts. PK-C phosphorylated the 47-kD protein, as has been reported previously, and phosphopeptide mapping disclosed a similar pattern of phosphorylation using either PK-C or the endogenous activity. The 47-kD protein labeled with the endogenous kinase contained predominantly phosphoserine, with some phosphothreonine and a trace of phosphotyrosine. Intact, purified talin was also phosphorylated by PK-P in a phospholipid-stimulable manner, but at 1/20 the rate of the 47-kD fragment.","['Simons, P C', 'Elias, L']","['Simons PC', 'Elias L']","['University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque 87131-5636.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Talin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (protein kinase P)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Talin/*metabolism']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67944-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Dec 1;82(11):3343-9.,,,,,,['1 R01 CA-42520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The major endpoint of the study was event-free survival (EFS) (""events"" being defined as failure to achieve complete remission [CR], occurrence of relapse, or death in CR). Early termination of the trial was decided after the first interim analysis, as EFS was significantly higher in the ATRA group. At the time, 101 patients had been randomized (54 in the ATRA group and 47 in the chemotherapy group). In the ATRA group, 49 (91%) patients achieved CR, 5 (9%) had early death, and 0 had resistant leukemia, compared with 38 (81%), 4 (8%), and 5 (10%) patients, respectively, in the chemotherapy group. The difference in CR rate between the two groups was not significant. The duration of coagulopathy was significantly reduced in the ATRA group, compared with the chemotherapy group. In the ATRA group, six patients relapsed after 7 to 15.5 months. In the chemotherapy group, 12 patients relapsed after 1 to 16 months, and 2 died in CR. Kaplan-Meier EFS was estimated at 79% +/- 7% and 50% +/- 9% at 12 months, respectively, in the ATRA and the chemotherapy group (P = .001). Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse was 19% +/- 8% and 40% +/- 12% at 12 months (P = .005). In conclusion, ATRA followed by chemotherapy increases EFS in newly diagnosed APL.

In order to avoid the potential hazard of using radioactive single-strand conformation analysis (SSCP), we used a nonradioactive SSCP method based on the silver stain of small minigels. In cell lines with known point mutations of the p53 gene, aberrant migrating bands were found. Serial dilutions indicated a sensitivity comparable to radioactive methods. Furthermore, a common polymorphism within the 4th exon of the p53 gene was easily detected. However, of 17 primary samples from patients with MDS, none harbored a p53 gene mutation.

In its oncogenic form, Jun can transform cells in culture and cause tumors in animals. Both trans-activation and transformation require several functional domains of Jun, including an amino-terminal trans-activation domain. In this study, properties of Jun required for trans-activation and transformation were explored by replacing the trans-activation domains of c-Jun and its oncogenic counterpart, v-Jun, with the constitutively active trans-activation domain from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein. The VP16-v-Jun chimera retained similar oncogenic properties to its parent, v-Jun. The VP16-c-Jun chimera, however, was considerably more oncogenic than c-Jun. Substitutions of a phenylalanine in the VP16 domain of the VP16-c-Jun chimera diminished or abolished transformation. Each of the chimeras bound to the AP-1 consensus recognition sequence from the collagenase promoter or from the human T-cell leukemia virus type I long terminal repeat in vitro. None of the VP16-Jun chimeras efficiently stimulated transcription from the collagenase promoter or an artificial promoter containing the human T-cell leukemia virus type I element in vivo.

In the present study, the histopathologic features of the joints in these mice were examined in order to compare the animal disease with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in humans. METHODS: Paraffin sections of limbs (right and left fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, knees, and ankles) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, azan-Mallory, or phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin, and examined by light microscopy. RESULTS: Abnormalities of the limbs began to occur as early as 3 weeks of age, and the incidence gradually increased until the mice were 12 months old. The incidence of arthropathy was 22% (48 of 217) at 3 months of age and 28% (18 of 64) at 6 months. The severity of the histopathologic changes in the joints of the transgenic mice ranged from grade I to grade IV. CONCLUSION: The major histopathologic features in the joints of HTLV-I transgenic mice are similar to those in humans with RA. Thus, these mice may represent a useful model for the study of the disease in humans.","['Yamamoto, H', 'Sekiguchi, T', 'Itagaki, K', 'Saijo, S', 'Iwakura, Y']","['Yamamoto H', 'Sekiguchi T', 'Itagaki K', 'Saijo S', 'Iwakura Y']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Kohno Clinical Medicine Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,,IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis/*etiology/pathology', 'Blood Vessels/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Joints/blood supply/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Synovial Membrane/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.1780361117 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1993 Nov;36(11):1612-20. doi: 10.1002/art.1780361117.,['HTLV-I pX'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that fagaronine is a DNA base-pair intercalator with a K(app) of 2.1 x 10(5) M-1 for calf thymus DNA. Fagaronine inhibits the catalytic activity of purified calf thymus topoisomerase I as shown by relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA followed by electrophoresis in neutral as well as in chloroquine-containing gels. The catalytic activity of topoisomerase I is inhibited at concentrations above 30 microM. Fagaronine also inhibits the catalytic activity of purified calf thymus topoisomerase II at concentrations above 25 microM as shown by decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. Fagaronine stabilizes the covalent DNA-enzyme reaction intermediate (the cleavable complex) between topoisomerase I and linear pBR322 DNA at concentrations up to 1 microM. Further increase of the fagaronine concentration leads to a progressive decrease in the cleavable complex formation, which is totally inhibited at 100 microM. In contrast, up to 1 microM fagaronine has no effect on cleavable complex formation between purified calf thymus topoisomerase II and linear pBR322 DNA, whereas cleavable complex formation is inhibited at higher concentrations. Exposure to fagaronine results in an increase in DNA-protein complex formation in intact P388 murine leukemia cells. P388CPT5 cells, which have an altered topoisomerase I activity, are 4-fold resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of fagaronine compared to the parental cell line. Similarly, DC-3F/9-OH-E Chinese hamster fibrosarcoma cells, which have an altered topoisomerase II activity, are about 5-fold resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of fagaronine. We conclude that fagaronine is an inhibitor of both DNA topoisomerase I and II and propose that this might play a role in the cytotoxic activity.","['Larsen, A K', 'Grondard, L', 'Couprie, J', 'Desoize, B', 'Comoe, L', 'Jardillier, J C', 'Riou, J F']","['Larsen AK', 'Grondard L', 'Couprie J', 'Desoize B', 'Comoe L', 'Jardillier JC', 'Riou JF']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, CNRS URA 147, INSERUM U 140, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '41758-44-5 (fagaronine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Catalysis/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Mice', '*Phenanthridines', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/10/19 00:00,1993/10/19 00:01,['1993/10/19 00:00'],"['1993/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90105-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90105-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Oct 19;46(8):1403-12. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90105-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochrome b558, one of the two oxidase redox components, comprises a light (alpha) and a heavy glycosylated (beta) subunit. The other redox component, a flavoprotein, is now thought to be the heavy subunit, on the basis of amino acid sequence comparisons and of reconstitution experiments with purified components. We published that pyridoxal-5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine is an inactivating affinity label for the NADPH-binding site of particulate oxidase from activated neutrophils. We have now radiolabeled the inactivated oxidase by reducing with Na[3H]BH4 the Schiff base formed between proteins and the reagent. Upon SDS-PAGE, the NADPH-inhibitable incorporation is found at the same position as the immunodetectable cytochrome heavy subunit, before and after deglycosylation. Membranes from either activated cells of a cytochrome-deficient X-linked granulomatous disease patient or normal resting cells show no incorporation at this position. Our results provide experimental evidence for the existence on the cytochrome b558 heavy chain of an NADPH-binding site which can only be affinity-labeled by PLP-AMP when the oxidase is active. This suggests the occurrence of a conformational change in the cofactor binding site upon enzyme activation.","['Ravel, P', 'Lederer, F']","['Ravel P', 'Lederer F']","['CNRS URA 1461, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Borohydrides)', '0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Schiff Bases)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '9064-78-2 (cytochrome b558)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Borohydrides/metabolism', 'Cytochrome b Group/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'NADP/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Schiff Bases']",1993/10/29 00:00,1993/10/29 00:01,['1993/10/29 00:00'],"['1993/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(83)72284-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.2284 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Oct 29;196(2):543-52. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.2284.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were preincubated with 20 microM farnesol for up to 2 h and pulsed with [3H]choline. PC biosynthesis was inhibited to one-quarter at the step catalysed by cholinephosphotransferase (CPT). CPT activity in cellular homogenates from farnesol-treated cells was significantly decreased, but no changes in cytidylyltransferase activity or diacylglycerol concentration were observed. Measurements of CPT activity in the experiments in which farnesol was added directly to the homogenates or microsomal fractions demonstrated that farnesol did not affect CPT activity. However, cytosol from farnesol-treated samples decreased microsomal CPT activity almost twice as much as did cytosol from controls. This effect was found to be heat-stable, and disappeared after dialysis, but could not be attributed to farnesol present in the cytosol. The effect of farnesol was specific when compared with other structurally similar isoprenoids. We conclude that farnesol brings about changes in cultured cells, leading to decreased CPT activity, and thus to the inhibition of PC biosynthesis.","['Voziyan, P A', 'Goldner, C M', 'Melnykovych, G']","['Voziyan PA', 'Goldner CM', 'Melnykovych G']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '4602-84-0 (Farnesol)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.8.2 (Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Choline/metabolism', 'Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase', 'Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase/*metabolism', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Farnesol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2950757 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Nov 1;295 ( Pt 3):757-62. doi: 10.1042/bj2950757.,,,,PMC1134625,,['NCI CA-08315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A series of 64 cases].,403-7,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral hemisphere tumors in children represent about 15% of all tumors of central nervous system. 30 to 40% of them are malignant and have a poor prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The files of 64 children (30 boys and 34 girls, less than 15 years old) treated between 1970 and 1989 for malignant cerebral hemisphere tumor were analysed. There were 27 astrocytomas, 20 ependymomas, 7 oligodendroblastomas, 6 sarcomas, 2 neuroblastomas, 1 medulloepithelioma and 1 teratoma. The tumor was located in the frontal area in 18 patients; it was temporal in 9, parietal in 8 and occipital in 2 patients. The tumor infiltrated 2 or several lobes in 27 children. The tumor was excised in 58 patients (completely in 36). Radiotherapy was given in 42 children; 18 of them also received chemotherapy. RESULTS: The time between the first clinical manifestation and diagnosis was longer than 6 months in 20% of cases. Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure were present at onset of the disease in 56% of patients and at admission in 73%. Convulsions revealed the tumor in only 30% of cases. Nine children died during the first post-operative month. The actuarial survival rate was 39 +/- 13% at 5 years and 29 +/- 13% at 10 years. This rate was better for ependymomas (48 +/- 23% at 5 years and 41 +/- 23% at 10 years) than for astrocytomas (25 +/- 18% and 13 +/- 16%). Three of the 27 astrocytomas developed in children who had been treated 6 to 7 years earlier for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One infant developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia 2 years after surgery and chemotherapy for astrocytoma and one patient, treated at 5 months of age for retinoblastoma, developed an astrocytoma 13 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Increased intracranial pressure is more frequently the first symptom than are convulsions in malignant cerebral hemisphere tumors. The long interval between the first manifestations and diagnosis suggests degeneration of benign tumors in 20% of cases. The development of a second malignant neoplasm is not exceptional in children. The better prognosis for ependymomas than for astrocytomas indicates that cerebral ependymomas should be excised and irradiated regardless of their grade.","['Hoppe-Hirsch, E', 'Hirsch, J F']","['Hoppe-Hirsch E', 'Hirsch JF']","['Service de Neurochirurgie Pediatrique, Hopital des Enfants-Malades, Paris.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Fr Pediatr,Archives francaises de pediatrie,0372421,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Astrocytoma/complications/pathology/surgery/therapy', '*Brain Neoplasms/complications/pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Ependymoma/complications/pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Prognosis']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Fr Pediatr. 1993 May;50(5):403-7.,,,,,,,,,Les tumeurs cerebrales hemispheriques malignes de l'enfant.

METHODS: A 66 year old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and borderline lepromatous leprosy who presented with subcutaneous elbow nodules, which were at first suspected to represent either progression of her haematological disease or leprosy, is described. The clinical characteristics of our patient and previous reports of another 24 subjects with adult onset benign rheumatoid nodules are reviewed. RESULTS: Biopsy of the patient's subcutaneous lesion disclosed the histopathology of a rheumatoid nodule; serological and clinical evaluations for rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatoid nodule associated systemic diseases were negative. Adult onset benign rheumatoid nodules are clinically and histologically identical to those found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. They often appeared in women during their 20s, frequently resolved spontaneously or were adequately treated by excision, and recurred in about one third of patients. The lesions were located in the ocular adnexa in 60% of patients. The most common lesional sites in patients with non-ocular benign rheumatoid nodules were the elbows, feet, and knees. None of these patients subsequently developed rheumatoid arthritis or other rheumatoid nodule associated diseases during follow up periods of as long as 20 years.

A high risk of infection by human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and of adult T-cell leukemia associated with such infection was found in this population. HTLV-I is also associated with a syndrome of progressive spastic paraparesis. We therefore evaluated the occurrence of HTLV-I infection and spastic paraparesis in Mashhadi-born Iranian Jews who immigrated to Israel. We examined 83 Mashhadi-born subjects (52 women, 31 men; mean age, 61 +/- 15.5 years) and 73 age-matched non-Mashhadi Iranian-born Jews. Blood samples were tested for HTLV-I antibodies by particle agglutination test. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect HTLV-I proviral DNA sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Fifteen Mashhadi-born Jews (18%) were both seropositive and PCR-positive for HTLV-I. Four HTLV-I-seronegative subjects were found to be positive for HTLV-I proviral DNA by PCR. Of the 19 HTLV-I-infected subjects (11 women, 8 men; mean age, 59 +/- 16 years), 13 (68%) had spastic paraparesis of varying severity.

Using the transferrin receptor system as a model, an approach to transfection is developed here within which involves the complexing of DNA to stable maleimido-transferrin/thio-poly-L-lysine conjugates. These studies establish the importance of precise stoichiometry for activity of ligand:poly-L-lysine conjugates, as well as a chemistry for their controlled conjugation. Also considered quantitatively are effects of the following related parameters on the efficiency of receptor-mediated transfection: lysine polymer length, conjugate concentration, DNA:conjugate ratio, and treatment of target cells with chloroquine and desferrioxamine. Compared directly to standard procedures (electroporation, modified DEAE-dextran, lipofection, and modified Ca2PO4 protocols), transfection via this transferrin receptor-mediated system was > or = 10-fold more efficient, and essentially nontoxic to erythroleukemic F-MEL and J2E cells. Following transfection these cells retained the physiological capacity to undergo induced differentiation in response to dimethyl sulfoxide (F-MEL cells), or to erythropoietin (J2E cells), the natural hormonal regulator of erythropoiesis.

Applying this method to a test system, photodynamically treated murine leukemia cells, we have identified and quantified a major family of overlapping PCOOHs and three ChOOHs, two of which are characteristic singlet oxygen adducts. In a typical separation, the detection limit is < 0.5 pmol for ChOOHs and < 50 pmol for more slowly eluting PCOOHs. In this respect, mercury drop detection outperforms all previously described electrochemical detection methods for lipid hydroperoxides and compares favorably with other HPLC-based approaches.

The potential efficacy of the suggested analyses is then explored by their application to simulated data that span the likely range of experimental behavior. Quantitative analysis of the displacement of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine from cultured leukemic cells by an adduct of 5'-S-(2-amino-ethyl)-N6-(4-nitrobenzyl)-5'-thioadenosine with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate is used to establish that the cells possess 6% fewer sites (150,000 cf. 159,000 sites/cell) for the fluorescent adduct than for the tritiated ligand, and that the binding is 10-fold weaker (binding constant of 0.28 cf. 2.8 nM-1). Corresponding analysis of results obtained with bovine aorta endothelial cells indicates that a 3-fold weaker interaction (binding constant of 1.1 cf. 3.3 nM-1) occurs between the fluorescent adduct and 79% of the cell sites accessible to the tritiated ligand.

The diagnostic clues are the detection of cytoplasmic granules in tumor cells on Wright-Giemsa-stained tissue imprints or smears and a selective loss of T-cell antigens. Immunophenotyping is decisive in making the final diagnosis by showing positive natural killer cell markers (CD16, CD56, and/or CD57), CD2, CD11c, and Ia, but negative CD3, T-cell receptor heterodimers, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and B-cell markers.

METHODS: Hospital discharge data for 1980 through 1987 were used to identify cases of cancer for 21 sites in women and 18 sites in men. Estimates of incidence were directly standardized to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program for the same time frame. RESULTS: Cancers of the gallbladder, kidney, stomach, and cervix show generally high rates among many American Indian and Alaska Native communities, and cancers of the liver and nasopharynx are high in Alaska. Of the relatively common cancers in Whites, American Indians and Alaska Natives experience lower rates for cancers of the breast, uterus, ovaries, prostate, lung, colon, rectum, and urinary bladder and for leukemia and melanoma. Variation among geographic areas and among tribal groups is observed for many important cancer sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates significant variations of cancer rates among American Indians and Alaska Natives, with important implications for Indian Health Service cancer control programs. The study also supports the potential use of hospital discharge data for estimating chronic disease among diverse American Indian and Alaska Native communities.","['Nutting, P A', 'Freeman, W L', 'Risser, D R', 'Helgerson, S D', 'Paisano, R', 'Hisnanick, J', 'Beaver, S K', 'Peters, I', 'Carney, J P', 'Speers, M A']","['Nutting PA', 'Freeman WL', 'Risser DR', 'Helgerson SD', 'Paisano R', 'Hisnanick J', 'Beaver SK', 'Peters I', 'Carney JP', 'Speers MA']","['Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80220.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Public Health,American journal of public health,1254074,,IM,"['Alaska/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indians, North American/*statistics & numerical data', 'Inuits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2105/ajph.83.11.1589 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Public Health. 1993 Nov;83(11):1589-98. doi: 10.2105/ajph.83.11.1589.,,,,PMC1694894,,['Y02-CN-90667/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of the t(15;17) translocation in the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.,1301-11,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized cytogenetically by a balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(15;17) (q22;q21). This translocation involves the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) on chromosome 17 and the promyelocytic leukemia locus (PML) on chromosome 15 and results in the transcription of novel fusion messenger RNAs. In this study, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was applied to the detection of the t(15;17) translocation in twenty-six clinical specimens cytologically diagnosed by French-American-British criteria as APL. This technique could readily be applied to both fresh and nonviably frozen tumor samples. In 24 of 26 samples, rearrangements of the PML and RAR-alpha, loci could be detected by Southern blotting after digestion with MluI and BssHII. Furthermore, co-migration of the rearranged fragments, detected by hybridization to probes for the PML and RAR-alpha genes, demonstrated that these loci were juxtaposed. The translocation was detected in specimens at the time of initial diagnosis, on differentiation therapy with retinoic acid and at the time of relapse. The diagnostic accuracy was compared to cytogenetics and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the novel PML-RAR-alpha fusion transcript. The samples from two patients were negative by all three diagnostic methods, and both of these patients failed to respond to all-trans retinoic acid. In the other 24 APL samples, cytogenetics was positive in only 76.9% of the cases, whereas both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and PFGE methods detected the translocation in 100% of the cases. Thus, PFGE can readily detect the t(15;17) translocation in both viable and nonviable clinical specimens and can improve the diagnostic accuracy of morphology and cytogenetics in APL. In contrast to conventional electrophoresis based on rearrangement of RAR-alpha, the ability to demonstrate directly co-migration of the PML and RAR-alpha loci enables this method to distinguish the t(15;17) translocation from variant translocations such as the t(11;15). Because PFGE can be performed on nonviable, frozen tumor samples, it could be diagnostically useful in APL when the RNA-based reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction cannot be performed.","['Xiao, Y H', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Warrell, R P', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Zelenetz, A D']","['Xiao YH', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Warrell RP', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Zelenetz AD']","['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cryopreservation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1993 Nov;143(5):1301-11.,"['PML', 'RAR-&agr;']",,,PMC1887161,,"['1R01-CA54494-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We used polymerase chain reaction and EBV-encoded small RNA-1 in situ hybridization to investigate the presence of EBV and immunohistochemistry to detect EBV-related oncoproteins, such as EBV-determined nuclear antigen-2 and latent membrane protein. Polymerase chain reaction performed on DNA of frozen specimens from 96 cases of ATLL revealed that the tumor tissue from 21 cases contained EBV DNA. EBV-encoded small RNA-1 in situ hybridization performed on the paraffin sections of the polymerase chain reaction-positive cases indicated EBV in the nuclei of ATLL tumor cells in 16 cases, nine of which were in the pleomorphic nuclei. Latent membrane protein was also detected in the cytoplasm of ATLL tumor cells in 15 cases, and EBV nuclear antigen-2 was observed in the nuclei of ATLL tumor cells in 11 cases. We conclude that EBV was present within tumor cells in about 17% of cases with ATLL and expressed EBV oncoprotein in the tumor cells.

In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of the AZT platelet elevating effect, we examined the number of splenic and bone marrow megakaryocyte colony-forming cells (CFU-mk) and the ploidy of megakaryocytes derived from CFU-mk using fluorescence cytophotometric methods. Two other dideoxynucleosides (ddN) 2'3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl) and 2'3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) were assessed to determine the specificity of the effect of AZT. MAIDS mice were given ddN in drinking water for 15 days. AZT was the only ddN that significantly increased circulating platelet levels in MAIDS mice. AZT significantly increased splenic CFU-mk in MAIDS mice, but bone marrow CFU-mk were not affected. ddl and ddC failed to change either platelet levels or the numbers of splenic or bone marrow CFU-mk. The ploidy of megakaryocytes derived from splenic and bone marrow CFU-mk were examined by first identifying CFU-mk by staining for acetylcholinesterase, followed by nuclear staining with propidium iodide. The fluorescence of individual cells was then measured using a Perceptics image analysis system. Modal ploidy of CFU-mk megakaryocytes derived from spleen cells of AZT-treated immunodeficient mice was shifted upwards from 16N to 32N. Similarly, AZT treatment changed the modal ploidy number of colony megakaryocytes derived from bone marrows of immunodeficient mice from 16N to 32N. The ploidy distribution was also significantly shifted. ddl and ddC failed to significantly alter either modal ploidy number or distribution of megakaryocytes derived from splenic or bone marrow CFU-mk.

Here they extend their previous work by quantitatively examining the relation between cancer mortality and ethylene oxide exposure. This study included workers from 13 of the 14 geographically distinct facilities that were included in the previous investigation. These facilities began regularly using ethylene oxide to sterilize medical supplies or spices sometime between 1938 and 1969. Workers were followed from first exposure through December 31, 1987. Historical exposures to ethylene oxide were estimated using a regression model. Standard life-table analysis was used to examine cancer mortality in three categories of cumulative exposure to ethylene oxide. The Cox proportional hazards model was also used to examine cumulative and other measures of ethylene oxide exposure as predictors of cancer mortality. In both the life-table analysis and the Cox model, a positive trend was observed in all lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer mortality for cumulative ethylene oxide exposure. This trend was strengthened when ethylene oxide exposures 10 years prior to death were discounted (lagged) and when the analysis was restricted to neoplasms of lymphoid cell origin. Despite limitations discussed in this paper, the authors believe that these findings provide some support for the hypothesis that exposure to ethylene oxide increases the risk of mortality from lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms. The authors intend to continue follow-up of this relatively young cohort, which may allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn in the future.","['Stayner, L', 'Steenland, K', 'Greife, A', 'Hornung, R', 'Hayes, R B', 'Nowlin, S', 'Morawetz, J', 'Ringenburg, V', 'Elliot, L', 'Halperin, W']","['Stayner L', 'Steenland K', 'Greife A', 'Hornung R', 'Hayes RB', 'Nowlin S', 'Morawetz J', 'Ringenburg V', 'Elliot L', 'Halperin W']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Robert A.

Retrovirus infection which has proceeded to murine AIDS permitted persistent Cryptosporidium infection, while non-retrovirus infected mice were resistant. Dietary alcohol provided until the day before parasite challenge did not affect resistance in controls, but increased the numbers of oocysts in the feces of retrovirus suppressed mice. Mortality was significant in retrovirus infected mice, and exacerbated slightly by dietary ethanol, while all controls survived parasite challenge. The retrovirus infected mice had greatly reduced numbers of intestinal CD4+ T helper cells and IgA+ B cells, which may explain their loss of intestinal resistance. Clearly, the severely immunosuppressed animals with murine AIDS were more sensitive to alcohol consumption than uninfected controls.

Compared to respective gender controls, male and female animals infected with the retrovirus infection manifested a heightened Cryptosporidium oocysts count regardless of cocaine treatment. Overall, female groups incurred a higher incidence of infection compared to respective male groups. To determine the role of cocaine, groups of male and female C57BL-6 mice of similar age were treated with cocaine for 4 weeks followed by termination. Cocaine synergized with retrovirus infection in female mice to cause a 30-fold increase in the number of oocyst present. The spleen size and weight of female mice was significantly greater than uninfected controls or male mice. However, due to the very slow progression to murine AIDS in the males, parasite resistance was retained, including in cocaine treated C57BL-6 mice. Thymus cell number in the retrovirus-infected female mice decreased significantly in comparison to uninfected female controls. Continued resistance to the parasite in male mice and its loss in female mice was due to the rate of immunosuppression and thus development of retrovirus-induced murine AIDS.","['Darban, H', 'Watson, R R', 'Alak, J', 'Thomas, N']","['Darban H', 'Watson RR', 'Alak J', 'Thomas N']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, NIAAA Specialized Alcohol Research Center, Tucson, AZ 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,['I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cocaine/*pharmacology', 'Cryptosporidiosis/*complications', 'Cryptosporidium/isolation & purification', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/parasitology/pathology', 'Organ Size', 'Retroviridae', 'Spleen/pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-2980-4_20 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1993;335:143-51. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-2980-4_20.,,,,,,['AAO8037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

No direct reaction between RAN and DNA template was observed and no effect of RAN on DNA TOPO II or RNA polymerase was found. Our results suggest that the cytotoxicity of RAN in vitro may be due to inhibition of DNA polymerase and increase of oxygen free radicals.","['Li, R Z', 'Ji, X J']","['Li RZ', 'Ji XJ']","['Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Yao Xue Xue Bao,Yao xue xue bao = Acta pharmaceutica Sinica,21710340R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Methylglycosides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'IBP7446K1O (ranunculin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Free Radicals', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Methylglycosides/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yao Xue Xue Bao. 1993;28(5):326-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The special aspects of radiotherapy: dosage, fractionation, focal volumes, risks, conclusions].",570-83,"For patients with Morbus Hodgkin and CS I/II of the low risk group and primary radiotherapy recommended treatment fields are: regional field for isolated high cervical involvement, mantle field for isolated mediastinal involvement and extended mantle field for the other patients. Omission of the infradiaphragmatic irradiation volume for PS I/II may be regarded as an advantage, which must be compared with the risk of a staging laparotomy, whereas the low risk of undertreatment of a small part of patients with CS I/II PS III probably does not outweigh the risk of the laparotomy. Equal efficacy of chemotherapy alone for these patients has not been proven sufficiently and important questions concerning long-term risks are unanswered. Ongoing studies will show, whether combinations with reduced chemotherapy or other types of chemotherapy and local radiotherapy are superior. Details of the mantle field borders and blocking are described. In most patients with adjuvant radiotherapy after complete remission after chemotherapy, the recommended target volume includes only the regions with proven involvement before chemotherapy. Details of the mediastinal treatment volume for patients with adjuvant radiotherapy after chemotherapy for bulky mediastinal disease are given. According to some recent analysis of a large body of dose-effect data, the recommended target doses in primary irradiation are between 36 and 40 Gy for regions with proven involvement and between 30 and 36 Gy for electively treated regions. The recommended target dose per fraction is between 1.5 and 1.8 Gy and less than 2 Gy in various critical tissues. According to the recent recommendations, the maximal total doses in mantle field radiotherapy to the spinal cord should be 38 Gy for radiotherapy alone and 36 Gy for radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. The maximal total dose to the whole heart should be 15 Gy and for the other parts between 30 and 35 Gy. After chemotherapy with MOPP oder MOPP-like regimes, there is a cumulative risk of leukaemia between 2.2 and 11.9%. After radiotherapy alone, there is only a very low risk of leukaemia after radiotherapy and chemotherapy to the risk after chemotherapy. Most long-term studies show an increased risk of solid second malignancies associated with radiotherapy with a relative risk of approximately two. In the analyzed studies, the cumulative risk of solid second malignancy after seven to 15 years is between 7 and 11.2% after radiotherapy, between 7 and 11.7% after chemotherapy and between 7 and 11.7% after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Glanzmann, C', 'Lutolf, U M']","['Glanzmann C', 'Lutolf UM']","['Department Medizinische Radiologie, Universitatsspital Zurich.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Usefulness of direct and serologic diagnosis].,283-8,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of different diagnostic methods for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with haematologic neoplasms. PATIENTS: Eight patients were evaluated for this study (5 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 2 acute leukaemias, and 1 chronic myelogenous leukaemia in blastic crisis). Depending on the clinical characteristics of each case, one or more diagnostic procedures were used: (a) microscopic observation of fresh samples from sputum, urine sediment, or fine-needle aspirate; (b) culture in Sabouraud agar, glucose-gentamicin medium of the pathologic products; (c) serologic techniques for detecting anti-Aspergillus spp antibodies and circulating antigen; (d) histologic examination of biopsy or necropsy specimens. RESULTS: The combination of microbiological methods (i.e., direct observation, culture, serology) provided the IA diagnosis in the 8 cases, this being confirmed by histologic observation in 5 instances (3 of them in necropsy studies). The observation of fresh samples allowed us to identify hyphae on different locations, although the culture of such material not always was positive. Seroconversion for Aspergillus spp was seen in 4 patients, whereas the antigen detection was negative in the 5 patients in whom this was attempted. CONCLUSIONS: (1) These findings suggest that different microbiological techniques must be combined for IA diagnosis when suspected in a severely compromised patient. (2) Direct microscopic observation may be of help, as it is a simple method allowing faster results than culture. (3) Serologic techniques, especially circulating antigen detection, are not fully developed.","['Hernandez, J M', 'Martin-Sanchez, A M', 'de Arriba, F', 'Caballero, M D', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Hernandez JM', 'Martin-Sanchez AM', 'de Arriba F', 'Caballero MD', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio Hematologia, H.C.U.

Analysis of 20 patients].,279-82,"PURPOSE: To analyse the status of iron deposits at diagnosis in patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included twenty consecutive patients with IM. Haemoglobin, MCV, serum iron and serum ferritin were determined in each case. Perls stain was used to evaluate iron deposits in bone marrow samples attained by aspiration or biopsy. An attempt was made to correlate the semiquantitative estimation of bone marrow iron with the peripheral blood values connected with iron deposits. RESULTS: Anaemia was present in 15 patients, but in most cases MCV and serum iron were normal. Iron deposits in bone marrow aspirate could be evaluated only in one patient as in the remainders no material was obtained. The semiquantitative estimation of iron in bone marrow biopsy samples showed diminished or absent deposits in 15 cases (75%). In contrast, none of the patients had decreased serum ferritin levels. No correlation was found between bone marrow iron and the peripheral blood values related to iron deposits. CONCLUSION: Most IM patients have decreased bone marrow iron deposits at diagnosis. However, as in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and in essential thrombocytopenia, such finding does not mean a true iron deficiency status.","['Cervantes, F', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Piera, C', 'Pereira, A', 'Aguilar, J L', 'Ordi, J', 'Rozman, C']","['Cervantes F', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Piera C', 'Pereira A', 'Aguilar JL', 'Ordi J', 'Rozman C']","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras Valenti, Servicio de Hematologia Biologica, Hospital Clinic, Universidad de Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*metabolism/pathology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1993 Aug;38(4):279-82.,,,,,,,,,Estudio de los depositos iniciales de hierro en la mielofibrosis idiopatica.

Study of 6 patients].,267-71,"PURPOSE: Splenic lymphoma with circulating villous lymphocytes (SLCVL) is a rare chronic B-type lymphoproliferative disorder, few series having been reported thus far. The major clinical, cytological, immunophenotypic and ultrastructural features, as well as the course and treatment of six cases seen in three hospitals of the Barcelona area in six years are reported herein. METHODS: The criteria of Melo et al were followed for the diagnosis of SLCVL. The clinical manifestations at onset and the morphology of lymphocytes from blood and bone-marrow (aspiration and biopsy samples) were analysed. The samples were subjected to cytochemical (acid phosphatase and L-tartaric acid inhibition), immunophenotypic (alkaline immunophosphatase and immunofluorescence) and ultrastructural studies. The histologic study of the spleen of those patients who underwent splenectomy was also performed. RESULTS: The median age of the series was 63 years (range: 45-86). Five of the patients were women. Anaemia was the commonest clinical finding at onset, and splenomegaly was found in all cases. Villous lymphocytes were found in both peripheral blood, 3% to 85%, and bone-marrow, 31% to 70%; they showed diffuse positivity to acid phosphatase stain, this being inhibited in all cases by L-tartaric acid. None of the patients had associated monoclonal gammopathy. Bone-marrow biopsy was performed in five occasions, showing nodular infiltrative pattern in three cases, interstitial in one and diffuse pattern in another. Nodular infiltration was seen in the white pulp of spleen, with no involvement of the red pulp. The ultrastructural study of villous lymphocytes from peripheral blood or bone-marrow disclosed short, slim villi with narrow bases, no lamellar ribosomal complexes being found. Mature B-type lymphocyte proliferation was present in all instances, showing positivity for surface immunoglobulin; monoclonal antibody CD25 was negative in all cases. Three patients underwent splenectomy, and the remainders received no treatment. The expected survival at three years was 80%. CONCLUSIONS: SLCVL is a rare B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with recognised morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics that make it distinguishable from other B-type lymphoproliferative diseases especially hairy cell leukaemia. Its clinical course is chronic and it has good prognosis. Response to splenectomy is usually favourable, although remission of the disease is not achieved.","['Batlle, M', 'Ribera, J M', 'Feliu, E', 'Milla, F', 'Sans-Sabrafen, J', 'Villamor, N', 'Marill, N', 'Woessner, S']","['Batlle M', 'Ribera JM', 'Feliu E', 'Milla F', 'Sans-Sabrafen J', 'Villamor N', 'Marill N', 'Woessner S']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol de Badalona.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Splenectomy', '*Splenic Neoplasms/blood/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Survival Rate']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1993 Aug;38(4):267-71.,,,['Sangre (Barc). 1993 Dec;38(6):503-4.

The mean follow-up was 14 months (standard deviation, 7 months). At the 6-month follow-up examination, the results suggested that FDB was more effective than CAP and CHOP in patients with stage B disease (n = 183), with 19% of FDB-treated patients achieving ""clinical and hematological remission"" (CR) compared with 11% of the CHOP-treated patients and 7% of the CAP-treated patients (P = .08; 6 degrees of freedom; chi-squared test). The rates of partial remission (PR) and overall response (CR + PR) were, respectively, 75% and 94% for the FDB-treated patients, 64% and 75% for the CHOP-treated patients, and 65% and 72% for the CAP-treated patients. However, in patients with stage C CLL (n = 77) at entry to the study, the remission status at 6 months showed slightly greater improvement in the CAP-treated group (n = 25), in which 84% of patients achieved remission (CR + PR) compared with 64% of patients in the FDB-treated group (n = 27) and 63% of patients in the CHOP-treated group (n = 27).

Primary and secondary malignant lymphomas of joints are rare. Our analysis of 6 years', new entries in the lymph node register in Kiel, covering 37.367 cases of malignant lymphomas, revealed only 20 cases (0.05%) with infiltration of joints. Slightly more men than women (1.18:1) are actually affected by articular lymphomas. In addition to 34 articular lymphomas of joints described in the literature between 1974 and 1992, we analyse 2 cases seen in our own institute and the 20 cases taken from the Kiel lymph node register. The peak incidence is between 40 and 60 years of age. One of our own cases, a woman of 92, is the oldest person ever affected. The most frequent localizations of NHLs are the knee, hip, and shoulder joints, with low-grade lymphomas predominating. Osteolytic lesions on radiographs are of decisive clinical and diagnostic significance for malignant articular lymphomas with affected bones. Lymphomas of joints are treated almost exclusively by radiation and chemotherapy, and sometimes a combination of both. Decisive prognostic significance attaches to the grade of malignancy and the fact of primary or secondary infiltration of the synovium and of the bone. The average survival time for patients with low-grade NHLs is 19 months with infiltration of the synovium and 27 months with infiltration of joint forming bones only, whereas the average survival time for patients high-grade lymphomas is 8 months with infiltration of the synovium and 11 months with infiltration only of joint-forming bones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kruger, R', 'Oden, J', 'de Leon, F', 'Durr, W']","['Kruger R', 'Oden J', 'de Leon F', 'Durr W']",['Pathologisches Institut Koblenz.'],['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Unfallchirurg,Der Unfallchirurg,8502736,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Neoplasms/classification/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/pathology', 'Synovial Membrane/pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Unfallchirurg. 1993 Oct;96(10):556-62.,,,,,41,,,,"Das maligne Non-Hodgkin-Lymphom des Gelenks.

Friend derived murine immunosuppressive virus (Fd-MIV) is a non-defective murine retrovirus which was isolated from T-helper cells from mice infected with the acute transforming retrovirus Friend leukaemia complex (FLC). In contrast to FLC, Fd-MIV does not induce acute transformation of lymphoid and erythroid cells but causes immunosuppression and lymphadenopathy in adult NMRI mice. The effect of Fd-MIV infection on B-lymphocytes was studied. Fd-MIV infection led to a persistent hypergammaglobulinemy with a significant increase in the level of circulating IgG, IgM and immune complexes. In the spleen and lymph nodes, B-lymphocyte proliferation was found. Parallel to the development of hypergammaglobulinemy, autoantibodies to a variety of nuclear and other autoantigens was detected. In conclusion, the Fd-MIV infection leads to a B-lymphocyte dysfunction that has many parallels with AIDS. Furthermore, the Fd-MIV infection seems to represent an example of an autoimmune condition caused by an exogenous infectious agent.","['Faxvaag, A', 'Moen, T', 'Dalen, A B']","['Faxvaag A', 'Moen T', 'Dalen AB']","['Institute of Cancer Research, University of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/biosynthesis', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis', '*Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb02588.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1993 Nov;38(5):459-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb02588.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transformation into acute leukaemia is frequent. These syndromes seem to be rarer in children, but they are often misdiagnosed. Some of their forms are particular to childhood. They include association with constitutional blood diseases predisposing to acute leukaemia, or with congenital or non-congenital malformative syndromes; there are hypoplastic forms, forms evolving towards stabilization of haematological abnormalities, and border forms with certain myeloproliferative syndromes. The diagnosis of myelodysplasia rests on morphological, functional, biochemical, isotopic data reflecting inefficient haematopoiesis, and on cytogenetic data. Studies of clonality and malignancy markers will in the near future enable us to distinguish between true preleukaemic states and polyclonal constitutional or virus-induced myelodysplasias, probably more frequent in children.

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for DXR in the K562/DXR cell line was 20 nM (in the K562 parental cell line, IC50 was 3.2 nM). Treatment of both types of cells with various concentrations of DXR or conjugates at equivalent concentrations of DXR was carried out. One type of the conjugates used was human serum albumin (HSA)-DXR conjugate and human transferrin (Tf)-DXR conjugate via a glutaraldehyde bridge (HSA-ga-DXR, Tf-ga-DXR, respectively) and another type used was HSA-DXR conjugate with a dextran bridge (HSA-dex-DXR). All of these conjugates showed potent dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth against the K562/DXR cells as compared with the cells treated with DXR or other controls. IC50 for HSA-ga-DXR, Tf-ga-DXR and HSA-dex-DXR conjugates in the K562/DXR cell line was 2.4, 3.6 and 1.0 (equivalent DXR) nM, respectively, which were approximately similar to the value of the K562 treated with DXR. Through the treatment of K562/DXR cells with HSA-DXR conjugate, the intracellular drug concentration increased as a function of time up to 24 h compared with the cells treated with DXR. Intracellular DXR effluxed rapidly from K562/DXR cells, but HSA-ga-DXR as well as HSA-dex-DXR conjugates remained in the cells at a relatively high concentration for a long time.

These results indicate that expression levels are composed of distinct contributions from the integrated vector and from the site of integration and are best explained in terms of a model in which the sites of chromosomal integration exert variable positive enhancer effects upon vector transcription.","['Duch, M', 'Paludan, K', 'Lovmand, J', 'Pedersen, L', 'Jorgensen, P', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Duch M', 'Paludan K', 'Lovmand J', 'Pedersen L', 'Jorgensen P', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/10/11 00:00,1993/10/11 00:01,['1993/10/11 00:00'],"['1993/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/21.20.4777 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Oct 11;21(20):4777-82. doi: 10.1093/nar/21.20.4777.,,,,PMC331505,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have derived a secondary structure model of nucleotides upstream from psi and of the gag initiation region of Mo-MuLV RNA in monomeric and dimeric forms, using chemical probing, sequence comparison and computer prediction. The 5' domain is extensively base-paired and interactions take place between U5 and 5' leader sequences. The U5-PBS subdomain can fold in two mutually exclusive conformations: a very stable and extended helical structure (E form) in which 17 of the 18 nucleotides of the PBS are paired, or an irregular three-branch structure (B form) in which 10 nucleotides of the PBS are paired. The dimeric RNA adopts the B conformation. The monomeric RNA can switch from the E to the B conformation by a thermal treatment. If the E to B transition is associated to dimerization, it may facilitate annealing of the primer tRNAPro to the PBS by lowering the free energy required for melting the PBS. Furthermore, dimerization induces allosteric rearrangements around the SD site and the gag initiation region.","['Mougel, M', 'Tounekti, N', 'Darlix, J L', 'Paoletti, J', 'Ehresmann, B', 'Ehresmann, C']","['Mougel M', 'Tounekti N', 'Darlix JL', 'Paoletti J', 'Ehresmann B', 'Ehresmann C']","['UPR 9002 du CNRS, Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopolymers', '*Genes, gag', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1993/10/11 00:00,1993/10/11 00:01,['1993/10/11 00:00'],"['1993/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/21.20.4677 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Oct 11;21(20):4677-84. doi: 10.1093/nar/21.20.4677.,['gag'],,,PMC331490,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chlorhexidine was studied to evaluate its broad spectrum antimicrobial properties and to evaluate its effect on immunosuppression-induced mucositis. Our double-blind randomized study revealed that chlorhexidine versus controls had considerable effect in the bone marrow transplant cohort.

The 1992 Urwick Lecture.,1677-84,"BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy recently has been used as a diagnostic modality for selected intraocular tumors and simulating conditions. However, the value of fine-needle aspiration biopsy for intraocular tumors previously has not been clarified. METHODS: Transocular fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed on selected patients who had intraocular lesions that were suspected clinically to be neoplasms but in which there was diagnostic uncertainty based on noninvasive clinical evaluation. These cases were analyzed to determine accuracy, complications, and limitations of the technique. RESULTS: Of 6500 patients referred to the Oncology Service for evaluation of possible intraocular tumor, transocular fine-needle aspiration biopsy was used clinically in 159 cases (2.4%). It proved to be a reliable diagnostic method for intraocular malignancies such as uveal melanoma, uveal metastasis, retinoblastoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. In the 140 cases (88%) in which adequate cytologic material was obtained, the sensitivity rate was 100% and the specificity rate was 98%. In 19 cases where the cytologic material was too scant to render a diagnosis, the sensitivity rate was 84% and the specificity rate was 98%. The problem of insufficient material for cytologic diagnosis has been greatly minimized with the recent use of a 22-gauge needle. The main complication was localized intraocular hemorrhage. Retinal detachment and tumor recurrence have not been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Transocular fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and reliable diagnostic method for suspected intraocular tumors and inflammatory conditions in which noninvasive diagnostic modalities have failed to establish the diagnosis and in which cytologic verification of the diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate treatment. Although the authors have had few complications with fine-needle aspiration biopsy, the technique should be reserved for selected cases where the diagnosis has not been established by less-invasive diagnostic measures.","['Shields, J A', 'Shields, C L', 'Ehya, H', 'Eagle, R C Jr', 'De Potter, P']","['Shields JA', 'Shields CL', 'Ehya H', 'Eagle RC Jr', 'De Potter P']","['Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Anterior Eye Segment/pathology', '*Biopsy, Needle/adverse effects/methods', 'Eye Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Eye Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Uvea/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(93)31418-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(93)31418-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1993 Nov;100(11):1677-84. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(93)31418-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major toxicity was found to be myelosuppression; thus, it was tried in acute leukemia. When given by daily bolus injection for 5 days, carboplatin exhibited some activity but was associated with additional nonhematologic toxicity as well. When administered by continuous infusion, responses were higher and toxicity less. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a phase II study of carboplatin 315 mg/m2 daily given by continuous infusion for 5 days to adults with refractory and relapsed acute leukemia. A second course was given if the bone marrow on day 14 revealed persistent leukemia. Those achieving a complete remission (CR) were given an additional course as consolidation. The median age was 49 years among acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients and 46 years in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Of 46 eligible patients enrolled in the study (36 AML and 10 ALL), 8 (17%) achieved a CR (6 AML and 2 ALL). Remissions were observed in 2 of 10 primary refractory patients (1 AML and 1 ALL). When treated in first relapse, 5 of 14 patients (36%) achieved a CR. In 38 instances marrow specimens were examined after treatment; 10 (26%) showed no change, 16 (42%) were hypoplastic, and 12 (32%) were hypoplastic with residual leukemic cells. Of the 18 deaths that occurred on study, 14 were due to infection, 2 due to infection and bleeding, 1 due to uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 due to graft-versus-host disease in a patient who had relapsed after bone marrow transplantation. Marrow suppression was usually prolonged. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. Gastrointestinal toxicity consisted of easily controlled nausea and vomiting. Three patients had grade 3 diarrhea. Grade 3 or more renal toxicity was observed in 8 patients, all of whom had received nephrotoxic antibiotics for treatment of bacterial or fungal infections. One patient died of renal failure that developed near the end of a second induction course. Ototoxicity was observed in 11 patients (24%) and was grade 2 or less in all but 3. These results indicate that carboplatin is an active agent in leukemia. Further studies are under way in combination with other agents such as etoposide, mitoxantrone, 5-azacytidine, and daunorubicin in treatment of acute leukemia and in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in refractory lymphomas.","['Vogler, W R']",['Vogler WR'],"['Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000227260 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1993 Nov;50 Suppl 2:42-6. doi: 10.1159/000227260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose of 0.4 g/kg BW was found to be optimal in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). From the first infusion onwards at least 80% of CLL patients had increases in all 12 antibodies. Five weeks after the last infusion the antibody levels were still elevated in 80% of patients with CLL. The dose of 0.8 g/kg raised all 12 antibodies in 53-73% of CLL patients when assessments were made after each infusion. In multiple myeloma (MM) patients, 73-82% and 73-91% of patients had increased antibody levels, respectively, before and after the 4th-6th infusions at the 0.8 g/kg dose level. However, in only 45-50% of patients did the antibodies remain increased 2 weeks after the treatment at this dose. The dose of 0.4 g/kg caused antibody increases in only 30-50% of patients when measured before the 4th-6th infusion. Serum IgG increased significantly only in the CLL patients, whereas in the MM patients it was high from the beginning owing to the disease. Therefore, the pneumococcal antibody levels were a better marker for the purpose of dose finding. The dosage recommendation in CLL is 0.4 g/kg every 3 weeks until week 12, when steady state is reached. The maintenance dose is 0.4 g/kg every 5 weeks. In MM patients, who have a faster elimination rate of antibodies, the recommended loading dose is 0.8 g/kg, followed by 0.4 g/kg every week as a continuous treatment. Treatment with IVIG in CLL and MM was generally well tolerated. Only 25% of patients experienced minor side-effects, the most frequent being febrile reactions, shivering and headache.","['Sklenar, I', 'Schiffman, G', 'Jonsson, V', 'Verhoef, G', 'Birgens, H', 'Boogaerts, M', 'Ferrant, A', 'Christensen, B E', 'Hasle, H', 'Drivsholm, A']","['Sklenar I', 'Schiffman G', 'Jonsson V', 'Verhoef G', 'Birgens H', 'Boogaerts M', 'Ferrant A', 'Christensen BE', 'Hasle H', 'Drivsholm A', 'et al.']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Downstate Medical Center, SUNY, Brooklyn.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Pneumococcal Infections/*prevention & control']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000227231 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1993 Nov-Dec;50(6):466-77. doi: 10.1159/000227231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report we have used an analog of MGBG, diethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (DEGBG), with a much greater specificity and potency against AdoMetDC, to investigate the effects of AdoMetDC inhibition on cell proliferation and polyamine metabolism in mouse L1210 leukemia cells. DEGBG was shown to effectively inhibit AdoMetDC activity in exponentially growing L1210 cells. The inhibition of AdoMetDC was reflected in a marked decrease in the cellular concentrations of spermidine and spermine. The concentration of putrescine, on the other hand, was greatly increased. Treatment with DEGBG resulted in a compensatory increase in the synthesis of AdoMetDC demonstrating an efficient feedback control.

Intoplicine induced both topoisomerase I- and II-mediated DNA strand breaks, using purified topoisomerases. The topoisomerase cleavage site patterns induced by intoplicine were unique, relative to those of camptothecin, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), and other known topoisomerase inhibitors. Both topoisomerase I- and II-induced DNA breaks decreased at drug concentrations higher than 1 microM, which is consistent with the DNA-intercalating activity of intoplicine. DNA damage was investigated in KB cells in culture by using alkaline elution. Intoplicine induced single-strand breaks (SSB) in a bell-shaped manner with respect to drug concentration (maximum frequency at 1 microM approximately 220 rad-equivalents). SSB formation was fast, whereas reversal after drug removal was slow. Similar bell-shaped curves were obtained for DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and DNA-protein cross-links. SSB and DNA-protein cross-link frequencies were approximately equal, and no protein-free breaks were detectable, indicating the protein concealment of the breaks, as expected for topoisomerase inhibition. Comparison of SSB and DSB frequencies indicated that intoplicine produced a significant amount of SSB not related to DSB, which is consistent with concomitant inhibition of both DNA topoisomerases I and II in cells. Data derived from resistant cell lines indicated that multidrug-resistant cells were cross-resistant to intoplicine but that m-AMSA- and camptothecin-resistant cells were sensitive to intoplicine. Hence, intoplicine might circumvent topoisomerase I-mediated and topoisomerase II-mediated resistance by poisoning both enzymes simultaneously.","['Poddevin, B', 'Riou, J F', 'Lavelle, F', 'Pommier, Y']","['Poddevin B', 'Riou JF', 'Lavelle F', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'FB2CIN6HMI (intoplicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'KB Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/toxicity', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Oct;44(4):767-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With L1210 murine leukemia cells an IC50 value for cell proliferation of 20 pM was obtained, and an increase in the mitotic index concordant with the decrease in cell number was observed. Kangaroo rat kidney PtK1 cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence with a spongistatin 1 concentration that caused 50% reduction in cellular protein (0.3 nM) and with a 10-fold higher concentration. These cells displayed mitotic and nuclear aberrations at both concentrations, and intracellular microtubules were reduced in number at the lower concentration and disappeared at the higher. Similar changes in PtK1 cells were observed after treatment with equivalent toxic concentrations of the antimitotic agents colchicine, vinblastine, halichondrin B, and dolastatin 10. Spongistatin 1 inhibited the glutamate-induced polymerization of purified tubulin (IC50 value of 3.6 microM versus 2.1 microM for dolastatin 10 and vinblastine and 5.2 microM for halichondrin B). Spongistatin 1 had no effect on the binding of colchicine to tubulin, but it was a potent inhibitor of the binding of vinblastine and GTP to tubulin. In initial experiments with 5 microM tubulin and 5 microM vinblastine, spongistatin 1 and dolastatin 10 both had IC50 values of 2 microM, whereas halichondrin B had an IC50 value of 5 microM.

Those cells treated with TPA for more than 18 hr started to differentiate to macrophages morphologically and functionally. These data suggest that the differentiated cells were more sensitive than original HL-60 cells because of increased binding of leukocidin and that treatment of TPA for 6 hr may transiently impair the signal transduction system of leukocidin after binding of leukocidin to the specific receptor of the cell membrane.

The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of bcr/abl rearrangement in the diagnosis and evolution of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: The rearrangement of the bcr/abl gene was studied in 81 cases of which 34 corresponded to patients with CML (29 Ph' positive chromosome, 2 Ph' negative chromosome and 3 without karyotype), 2 patients with Ph' positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 patients with chronic myeloproliferative syndromes different from CML and 30 controls. Of the patients with CML, 6 were reevaluated when a blastic crisis was developed, 2 after receiving interferon treatment and 1 following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The technique used was that of Southern blotting using the restriction enzymes Bgl II and BamHI and the transprobe. RESULTS: Rearrangement of the bcr/abl gene was observed in all the patients with CML except in one with Ph' negative chromosome. In the remaining cases bcr/abl rearrangement was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The Southern blotting technique for the study of the bcr/abl gene rearrangement is a sensitive and specific method in the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia constituting a valid alternative to chromosomic study when this cannot be carried out or is not conclusive.

Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies were present in the serum and the specific env HTLV-I sequences were detected in the DNA extracted from the valves and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using polymerase chain reaction technique.

A population of immature lymphoid cells positive for CD10 (CALLA) and CD19 (Leu 12) was initially interpreted as suggestive of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, a second bone marrow biopsy revealed morphologic features consistent with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) with fibrosis. This diagnosis was supported by the flow cytometric study showing increased myeloid and megakaryocytic antigen-positive cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood obtained after chemotherapy for ALL. This report presents evidence that the original lymphoid population represented hematogones, which were preferentially aspirated due to marrow fibrosis. There are no previous reports of hematogones identified at the presentation of an acute leukemia. It also emphasizes that the presence of hematogones with the resultant marker findings can be misleading.

We describe a novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method using clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene sequences as tumor markers. From such sequences patient-specific oligonucleotide primers and probes were generated, and used to detect tumor cells. Seven MM patients were selected for this study, and tumor cells were found in all peripheral blood samples. The demonstration of circulating tumor cells suggests some caution when using peripheral blood for autograft procedures, even though its contamination is lower than bone marrow.

However, in most cultures, leukemic cells survived for only a few weeks and the majority of viable cells present after 28 days of culture were esterase-positive mononuclear cells. Based on the hypothesis that mononuclear cells inhibited leukemic cell growth, we evaluated the effect of a monocyte toxin, L-leucine methyl ester (Leu-OMe), on the growth of four frozen BCP-ALL samples. Thawed leukemic cells treated with Leu-OMe, but not untreated control cells, proliferated in three samples and one new cell line was established.

Previous reports have shown that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, although infectable by EBV, are resistant to immortalization (1-4), although a small number of CLL cell lines have been reported (5-7). In the present study we have analysed early events occurring after EBV infection in 16 CLL samples. Out of 16 samples, 15 could be infected by the virus and expressed the full EB viral nuclear antigen (EBNA) complex but only one out of 16 expressed the latent membrane protein (LMP). The five CLLs in which we could investigate the presence of viral episomes showed circularized EBV by 16 hours after infection. The sequence of EBNA expression and genome circularization mirrored that seen in normal B cells, although genome amplification was not detected. The only CLL sample which expressed LMP after EBV infection was induced to proliferate for 2-3 weeks, but no cell line was established. Immortalized cell lines were obtained from three out of 16 samples tested, but all were polyclonal for light chain expression and had arisen from the CD5-negative, normal B-cell population. Thus the inability of EBV to induce proliferation of most CLL cells correlated with the absence of LMP expression which is invariably expressed during immortalization of normal B cells. This novel type of restricted gene expression could be compatible with evasion of host immune responses and consequent long-term survival of the cell in vivo.","['Doyle, M G', 'Catovsky, D', 'Crawford, D H']","['Doyle MG', 'Catovsky D', 'Crawford DH']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*microbiology/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/microbiology/pathology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/analysis']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1858-64.,,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

We studied apoptosis in the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line which differentiates when exposed to phorbol ester (S-cell), and in the PET-cell mutant of HL-60 which is defective in its response to phorbol ester. Exposing S-cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (3 nM and above) induced morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (visualized by light microscopy), and induced fragmentation of chromatin DNA to oligonucleosomal lengths. These changes were obvious in 48 h. In contrast, 1000 nM TPA for five days did not induce apoptosis in the PET-cell. DNA fragmentation was induced in both cell lines by A23187 (0.25 microM) and etoposide (7 microM). Novobiocin (600 and 900 microM) induced DNA fragmentation in S-cells, but higher concentrations inhibited fragmentation. Novobiocin is believed to induce DNA fragmentation by a direct action on DNA. In the case of PET-cells, novobiocin did not induce DNA fragmentation at any concentration, and prior treatment of PET-cells with novobiocin (300-1200 microM for 30 min) inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by A23187. Novobiocin inhibited cell growth equally in S-cell and PET-cells. It is concluded that the promyelocytes have the capacity to undergo apoptosis in response to agents which activate protein kinase C, and that the PET-cell has a mutation which disables both protein-kinase C-induced and novobiocin-induced DNA fragmentation, leaving intact the ability of novobiocin to protect DNA from calcium-entry-initiated fragmentation. The elucidation of the lesion responsible for the PET phenotype is likely to increase our understanding of this important pathway for regulating cellular proliferation and how it bears on leukemogenesis and chemotherapy.","['Macfarlane, D E', ""O'Donnell, P S""]","['Macfarlane DE', ""O'Donnell PS""]","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Iowa City, IA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Tolerance/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Novobiocin/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1846-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A common mechanism of p53 inactivation in CML is by complete deletion of one p53 allele in association with a point mutation which produces a mutant p53 protein on the remaining allele. Whether the mutant p53 protein, which is generally expressed at an elevated level, plays any role in the pathogenesis of blastic transformation or in maintaining the neoplastic proliferation, as it does in some solid tumors, is unknown. By using an antisense oligonucleotide approach, we investigated the cellular function of known abnormal forms of p53 protein, both mutant and truncated, expressed in CML cell lines. We found that the introduction of p53 antisense oligonucleotides can specifically inhibit the translation of the p53 mRNA. However, inhibiting p53 expression had no effect on cell proliferation, cell viability, and colony formation. There was no change in cell doubling time when the cells were maintained in serum-free medium (SFM) in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides compared with cells maintained in SFM alone. We conclude that the mutant or truncated p53 proteins expressed in the blast cells of CML have no growth-promoting effect and are not required for cell survival and proliferation. We further speculate that the loss of the tumor suppressor function of p53 might be the only mechanism by which p53 is involved in the transition from chronic phase to blast crisis.","['Bi, S', 'Lanza, F', 'Goldman, J M']","['Bi S', 'Lanza F', 'Goldman JM']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Thionucleotides', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1840-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To dissect the role of c-Myc in the proliferation-differentiation switch we have studied c-myc expression in K562 cells exposed to several chemical agents. This model system allowed us to discriminate between the growth arrest and differentiation phenomena as well as the induction of differentiation along two different lineages (erythroid and myelomonocytic). Our results showed that c-myc expression did not significantly decrease when growth inhibition is reversible, either by treatment with a differentiating agent such as hydroxyurea (which induced erythroid differentiation) or by a non-differentiating agent such as interferon-alpha. In contrast, c-myc expression decreased when cells underwent terminal differentiation, either along the myelomonocytic (by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) or erythroid (by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) lineages. These results indicated that c-myc down-regulation is not obligatory for growth arrest and non-terminal differentiation of human myeloid cells. In contrast, c-myc down-regulation occurred in terminal differentiation, but induction of myelomonocytic differentiation resulted in a greater loss of c-myc mRNA than induction of erythroid differentiation.","['Gomez-Casares, M T', 'Delgado, M D', 'Lerga, A', 'Crespo, P', 'Quincoces, A F', 'Richard, C', 'Leon, J']","['Gomez-Casares MT', 'Delgado MD', 'Lerga A', 'Crespo P', 'Quincoces AF', 'Richard C', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicine, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1824-33.,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of mice with CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) prior to or after inoculation of a lethal dose of RCS tumor cells inhibits cell growth and the mice survive. The mechanism of tumor growth inhibition was studied by adoptively transferring cells from CD4 mAb treated tumor bearers into naive syngeneic mice. The recipient mice developed tumors and died. Tumor growth was dependent on the concentration of the adoptively transferred tumor cells. These results suggested that a state of tumor dormancy was established in the treated mice. Tumor dormancy was long lasting, as cells transferred as late as 11 weeks after the initial RCS inoculation still developed tumors in the recipient. The maintenance of dormancy was not due to failure of the recipient mice to mount an anti-tumor response or to the induction of suppressor cells. These results suggest that in the absence of CD4 cells, the RCS tumor remains dormant and this state of dormancy persists for long periods after total recovery of the CD4 cell subpopulation. Thus, it appears that RCS proliferation and growth is dependent on host CD4 cells but maintenance is under the influence of other cells or factors. Further characterization of this tumor dormant system and its regulation by the host may reveal novel mechanisms of tumor dormancy.","['Ohnishi, K', 'Bonavida, B']","['Ohnishi K', 'Bonavida B']","['Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Female', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/physiology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1801-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To mimic the clinical situation, MRD induction treatment was given to rats showing clinical signs of leukemia and consisted of 80 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 7.0 Gy X-rays total body irradiation resulting in a 6-8 log leukemic cell kill leaving 10-1000 leukemic cells in the animals. Treatment was completed with a syngeneic bone marrow transplant. A high dose level (HD) treatment of 23.7 mg acetyldinaline/kg per day and a low dose level (LD) treatment of 11.85 mg/kg per day, each given orally for five consecutive days, were compared. The increase in the survival time, the cure rate, and the toxic death rate were evaluated. One 5-day course of LD treatment, started at a time interval of 10, 17, or 24 days following MRD induction, resulted in 44%, 11% or 0% cures. With two 5-day courses of LD treatment, 89%, 22%, or 0% cures were achieved. With LD treatment, maximally an 8 log leukemic cell kill was obtained and no toxicity-related deaths were observed (only less than a 1 log kill of normal hemopoietic stem cells). In contrast, a single course of HD treatment resulted in 56% of the rats (10/18) dying from intestinal tract toxicity, while from the remaining eight rats at risk for relapse, three (37%) showed a very late relapse and five were cured (63%). It was evident that the leukemic cell load at the start of the acetyldinaline treatment determined the probability of relapse. An important finding was that acetyldinaline did not interfere with bone marrow regeneration. The highly curative potential of acetyldinaline treatment in the BNML model during the phase of MRD warrants the introduction of this compound in clinical phase I/II studies.","['el-Beltagi, H M', 'Martens, A C', 'Dahab, G M', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['el-Beltagi HM', 'Martens AC', 'Dahab GM', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Hemato-Oncology/TNO, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', 'UMF554N5FG (tacedinaline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Phenylenediamines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Recurrence']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1795-800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reviewed what is known and still unknown about the molecular and biological abnormalities in CML that may be relevant to developing improved, more selective treatment. CML originates in a multipotential stem cell due to its acquiring a highly consistent specific chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22; this results in a fused bcr/abl gene and an abnormal 210 kDa fusion protein which has increased intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity compared to the normal c-abl protein. It is still unknown how p210bcr-abl alters the signal transduction pathways, but the main biological abnormality is discordant or asynchronous maturation, with the cytoplasm generally maturing more rapidly than the nucleus. The major expansion of the CML population takes place in the intermediate and later maturation compartments rather than in the stem cell or early progenitor cell compartments. The expansion occurs slowly, probably taking several years to reach a trillion or more cells, at which time clinical symptoms begin to develop. The maturing leukemic progenitors do not have an increased proliferative rate, but they undergo one or more additional divisions and also live longer than comparable normal progenitors. The earliest CML blast cell population we have been able to study has reduced ultimate proliferative capacity compared to a comparable primitive normal blast cell population. Although no quantitative stem cell assay is available, indirect evidence suggests that the CML stem cells' biological behavior may be relatively unaffected or deviate only slightly from normal. The bcr/abl gene and its fusion protein are promising targets for development of novel specific therapies, but before this can be accomplished it will be necessary to understand more completely the molecular and biochemical abnormalities and to correlate them with the biological manifestations of the disease.","['Clarkson, B', 'Strife, A']","['Clarkson B', 'Strife A']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics Program, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1683-721.,,,,,385,"['NCI CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI P30-CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The standard assay for MRD in experimental mice is the adoptive transfer of spleen cells from experimental animals into naive secondary syngeneic recipients. We describe here the detection of MRD in BCL1-carrying BALB/c mice using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A BCL1 specific sequence from the rearranged VH-region was amplified yielding a 456 bp long fragment. PCR products hybridized to the cloned BCL1 sequence allowed the detection of a single BCL1 cell.

Annexin VIII mRNA was found to be specifically expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells; it was not found in other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) nor in lymphoid malignancies. Using Northern blot analysis we investigated annexin VIII expression in 142 continuous human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines at the mRNA level. While the only APL cell line, NB-4, was indeed positive, other cell lines also displayed annexin VIII mRNA: 4/22 myeloid cell lines, 8/23 monocytic cell lines, 2/8 megakaryoblastic cell lines, 5/26 lymphoma-derived cell lines, 2/10 myeloma cell lines and 1/44 lymphoid leukemia cell lines. The strongest expression was seen in NB-4 and in the Hodgkin's disease derived cell line HDLM-2. Treatment of NB-4 cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or the phorbol ester TPA induced terminal differentiation and down-regulated annexin VIII mRNA expression rapidly within a few hours; vitamin D3 was ineffective in this regard; the protein kinase C activator Bryostatin 1 up-regulated the expression. A panel of initially negative cell lines could not be induced by any of these biomodulators to transcribe annexin VIII. The half-life (T1/2) of annexin VIII mRNA was about 3-4 h using actinomycin D as transcription inhibitor. Treatment with ATRA or TPA prior to exposure to actinomycin shortened the T1/2 to 2 h while Bryostatin 1 extended it to 6h. As 21/141 non-APL cell lines were positive, annexin VIII cannot be used as a marker gene for APL cells; however, it might be associated with myelomonocytic or erythro-megakaryoblastic precursor cells. Annexin VIII gene expression might play a unique role in the proliferation and/or differentiation of leukemic cells and could be associated with the particular abnormal hemostasis of some leukemias.","['Hu, Z B', 'Ma, W', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Hu ZB', 'Ma W', 'Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Annexins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(93)90042-j [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Nov;17(11):949-57. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90042-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No cell population responded to anti-CD40 mAb alone. SAC only induced a high DNA synthesis rate in normal B-cells as well as in B-CLL cells, although the magnitude was three-fold lower and delayed for about 48 h in B-CLL. B-MLUS cells did not proliferate in response to SAC. The combination of anti-CD40 and SAC enhanced the proliferative capacity of normal B-cells and produced a more rapid response in B-CLL. B-MLUS cells were not activated. Normal B-cells and B-MLUS did not secrete IgM after SAC stimulation, while B-CLL cells had a continuous increase in the IgM production during a 6-day culture period. The higher proliferative capacity of B-CLL cells compared with B-MLUS cells may be explained by an increased expression of activation molecules e.g. receptors for various cytokines and growth factors. Moreover, the inertness and inability of B-MLUS cells in comparison to normal B- and B-CLL cells to respond to powerful activation signals might indicate an intrinsic defect of B-MLUS cells in the signal transduction leading to a block of mitosis and a benign course of the disease.","['Garcia, C A', 'Rosen, A', 'Aguilar-Santelises, M', 'Jondal, M', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Garcia CA', 'Rosen A', 'Aguilar-Santelises M', 'Jondal M', 'Mellstedt H']","['Department of Biology, Instituto Nacional de Oncologia y Radiobiologia, Habana, Cuba.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocytosis/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(93)90040-r [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Nov;17(11):933-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90040-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the findings of two patients with extremely high white cell counts, which show that the hypoxaemia found is in fact true hypoxaemia, even in asymptomatic patients, and that met-haemoglobinaemia may be at least in part responsible for the low PaO2. We also showed that pulse oximetry was completely unreliable in our patients due to the elevated met-haemoglobin levels.

Lymphocytes from several lymphoid tissues were studied including human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), spleen cells, thymocytes, and thoracic duct lymphocytes. Cells were cultured with IL-4 in the presence or absence of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) in 4-day cultures. LAK and natural killer (NK) activities were measured in a standard chromium release cytotoxicity assay against LAK-sensitive, NK-resistant M14 melanoma targets and NK-sensitive K562 erythroleukemic cells. IL-4 alone does not increase NK or LAK activity under the conditions studied. However, IL-4 does inhibit the induction of cytotoxic activity by IL-2. IL-4 inhibits IL-2-induced thymidine incorporation in 3-day PBL cultures, suggesting that the inhibition of cytotoxicity is not a dilution effect due to the proliferation of noncytotoxic cell populations. IL-4 also inhibits the development of LAK and NK-like activities generated in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) while augmenting MLC-generated allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. Thus, IL-4 appears to inhibit the induction of nonspecific cytotoxic effectors while augmenting the generation of MHC-specific responses. This confirms an important regulatory function for this lymphokine in the generation of cytotoxic effectors.","['Colquhoun, S D', 'Economou, J S', 'Shau, H', 'Golub, S H']","['Colquhoun SD', 'Economou JS', 'Shau H', 'Golub SH']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-4804(83)71173-X [pii]', '10.1006/jsre.1993.1173 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 1993 Nov;55(5):486-92. doi: 10.1006/jsre.1993.1173.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is considered to have an autoimmune etiology, however, its etiopathogenesis remains largely unknown. Recently, retrovirus is suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of SS, because SS-like lesions are reported in HIV infection or in human T cell leukemia virus type I infection. Moreover, human intracisternal A-type retroviral particles are reported to be detected in SS patients. During the course of our study on the histopathology of mice infected with a murine retrovirus, we happened to find SS-like exocrinopathy in those mice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Four-week-old C57BL/6 (B6) mice were injected intraperitoneally with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus. This virus is known to induce splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy followed by lymphoid malignancy, and profound immunodeficiency in sensitive strains of mice. From 4 to 16 weeks after the virus inoculation, the infected mice were sacrificed and their submandibular and lacrimal glands were analyzed light and electron microscopically and immunohistochemically. The existence of the virus in the lesion in situ was also analyzed by the same method, and additionally by a polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Periductal lymphocytic infiltration into the submandibular and lacrimal glands was observed in all the virus-infected mice at 4 weeks after the infection and progressed with time. Extraglandular lymphocytic infiltration was also observed in liver, kidney, lung, and pancreas. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that most infiltrating cells into the glands were composed of CD3+ T cells (CD4-dominant), Mac-1+ cells, and B220+ cells. The virus genome was detected in submandibular glands by immunohistochemistry or by polymerase chain reaction. In addition, retroviral particles were secreted into the lumen of exocrine ducts of submandibular glands. CONCLUSIONS: This might be an SS animal model that is induced by a certain defined retrovirus. This experimental system might provide us with valuable information for analyzing the mechanisms of how a retrovirus could induce SS.","['Suzuki, K', 'Makino, M', 'Okada, Y', 'Kinoshita, J', 'Yui, R', 'Kanazawa, H', 'Asakura, H', 'Fujiwara, M', 'Mizuochi, T', 'Komuro, K']","['Suzuki K', 'Makino M', 'Okada Y', 'Kinoshita J', 'Yui R', 'Kanazawa H', 'Asakura H', 'Fujiwara M', 'Mizuochi T', 'Komuro K']","['Department of Blood Products, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney/microbiology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lacrimal Apparatus/microbiology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Liver/microbiology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Pancreas/microbiology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/microbiology/*pathology"", 'Submandibular Gland/microbiology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Thyroid Gland/microbiology/*pathology/ultrastructure']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1993 Oct;69(4):430-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recently identified protein with a molecular weight of 12,000 (12K) (p12I), encoded by single- and double-spliced mRNAs transcribed from the 3' end of the HTLV-I genome, has been shown to localize in the perinuclear compartment and in the cellular endomembranes. The p12I protein exhibits significant amino acid sequence similarity to the E5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). Both proteins are very hydrophobic, contain a glutamine residue in the middle of a potential transmembrane region(s), and are localized in similar cellular compartments. Because of these observations, we investigated whether the p12I resemblance to E5 correlated with a similarity in their biological behavior. We expressed the p12I protein to evaluate its ability to functionally cooperate with the BPV-1 E5 oncoprotein and to bind to a cellular target of the E5 protein, the 16K component of the vacuolar H+ ATPase. Cotransfection of the mouse C127 cell line with the p12I and E5 cDNAs showed that although p12I alone could not induce focus formation, it strongly potentiated the transforming activity of E5. In addition, the p12I protein bound to the 16K protein as efficiently as the E5 protein. These findings might provide new insight for potential mechanisms of HTLV-I transformation and suggest that p12I and E5 represent an example of convergent evolution between RNA and DNA viruses.","['Franchini, G', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Koralnik, I J', 'Lo Monico, A', 'Sparkowski, J J', 'Andresson, T', 'Goldstein, D J', 'Schlegel, R']","['Franchini G', 'Mulloy JC', 'Koralnik IJ', 'Lo Monico A', 'Sparkowski JJ', 'Andresson T', 'Goldstein DJ', 'Schlegel R']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (oncogene protein E5, Bovine papillomavirus type 1)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Bovine papillomavirus 1/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Vacuoles/enzymology', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.12.7701-7704.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Dec;67(12):7701-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.12.7701-7704.1993.,,,,PMC238245,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transduction efficiency of the constructs was tested on target cells that either have only ecotropic receptors (CHO-2 and CHO-11 cells), only amphotropic receptors (mink lung fibroblasts and Cos 1 cells), or both types of receptors (NIH 3T3 cells). The assay made use of the fact that the mechanism for viral entry of ecotropic viruses is pH dependent while that of amphotropic viruses is pH independent. Treatment of target cells with NH4Cl, which prevents the reduction of pH within endosomes, reduced the titers of viral particles bearing the C-terminal moiety from the ecotropic envelope but did not reduce the titers of particles which had a C-terminal moiety from the amphotropic envelope. In addition, in contrast to other low-pH-dependent enveloped viruses, brief acid treatment did not allow surface-bound viruses to bypass the NH4Cl block.

The protein coding sequences for this virus are identical to those of M-MuLV. Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV induces T-cell disease with a much lower incidence and longer latency than wild-type M-MuLV. We have previously shown that Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV is defective in preleukemic events induced by wild-type M-MuLV, including splenic hematopoietic hyperplasia, bone marrow depletion, and generation of recombinant mink cell focus-inducing viruses (MCFs). We also showed that an M-MCF virus driven by the Mo+PyF101 LTR is infectious in vitro but does not propagate in mice. However, in these experiments, when a pseudotypic mixture of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV and Mo+PyF101 MCF was inoculated into newborn NIH Swiss mice, they died of T-cell leukemia at times almost equivalent to those induced by wild-type M-MuLV. Tumor DNAs from Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV-Mo+PyF101 MCF-inoculated mice were examined by Southern blot analysis. The predominant forms of Mo+PyF101 MCF proviruses in these tumors contained added sequences in the U3 region of the LTR. The U3 regions of representative tumor-derived variant Mo+PyF101 MCFs were cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and sequencing indicated that they had acquired an additional copy of the M-MuLV 75-bp tandem repeat in the enhancer region. NIH 3T3 cell lines infected with altered viruses were obtained from representative Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV-Mo+PyF101 MCF-induced tumors, and mice were inoculated with the recovered viruses. Leukemogenicity was approximately equivalent to that in the original Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV-Mo+PyF101 MCF viral stock. Southern blot analysis on the resulting tumors now predominantly revealed loss of the polyomavirus sequences. These results suggest that the suppressive effects of the PyF101 sequences on M-MuLV-induced disease and potentially on MCF propagation were overcome in two ways: by triplication of the M-MuLV direct repeats and by loss of the polyomavirus sequences.","['Brightman, B K', 'Farmer, C', 'Fan, H']","['Brightman BK', 'Farmer C', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/microbiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics', 'Virulence']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.12.7140-7148.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Dec;67(12):7140-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.12.7140-7148.1993.,,,,PMC238176,,['CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The construct, pBLV913, was selected for infection of two sheep by inoculation of microinjected cells. After 15 months, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these sheep served as inocula for the transfer of infection to four additional sheep. All six infected sheep seroconverted to BLV and had detectable BLV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Four of the six sheep developed altered B/T-lymphocyte ratios between 33 and 53 months postinfection. One sheep died of unrelated causes, and one remained hematologically normal. Two of the affected sheep developed B lymphocytosis comparable to that observed in animals inoculated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV-infected cattle. This expanded B-lymphocyte population was characterized by elevated expression of B-cell surface markers, spontaneous blastogenesis, virus expression in vitro, and increased, polyclonally integrated provirus. One of these two sheep developed lymphocytic leukemia-lymphoma at 57 months postinfection.

The Y substrates, constructed from individual oligonucleotides, contain a single viral long terminal repeat (LTR) joined to a nicked target DNA. Truncation of the double-stranded LTR sequences distal to the conserved 5'-CA-3' dinucleotide progressively diminished disintegration activity. M-MuLV IN was also able to catalyze disintegration of a heterologous double-stranded LTR sequence. Significantly, the activity of M-MuLV IN on single-stranded LTR Y substrates was more dependent on the sequence and length of the LTR strand than that reported for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN. Modifications introduced at the Y-substrate junction demonstrated that the 3'-hydroxyl group at the terminus of the target strand was necessary for efficient joining of the target DNA strands. The presence of a 2'-hydroxyl group at the 3' end of the target strand, as well as a single-nucleotide gap at the LTR-target junction, reduced disintegration activity. The absence of hydroxyl groups on the terminal nucleotide abolished joining of the target strands. The results presented here suggest that M-MuLV IN disintegration activity is dependent on substantially different LTR sequence requirements than those reported for HIV-1 IN and may be mediated primarily through a structural recognition event.","['Donzella, G A', 'Jonsson, C B', 'Roth, M J']","['Donzella GA', 'Jonsson CB', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway 08854-5635.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'Integrases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Virus Integration']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.12.7077-7087.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Dec;67(12):7077-87. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.12.7077-7087.1993.,,,,PMC238169,,"['5T32AI07043-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'IF32CA09242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Fujii, T. Niki, T. Mori, T. Matsuda, M. Matsui, N. Nomura, and M. Seiki, Oncogene 6:1023-1029, 1991). In this study, the 5'-flanking region of the human fra-1 gene, which is a Tax1-inducible fos-related gene, was isolated and Tax1 or serum-responsive cis elements were analyzed to obtain further insight into the mechanism of Tax1 action. The 62-bp sequence starting 46 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation site showed 71% homology with the sequence surrounding the TATA box of the c-fos promoter. Regulatory motifs identified in the c-fos promoter, such as an Ets-binding site, E boxes, a CArG box, c-fos AP-1 sites, and two retinoblastoma control elements, were also found upstream of the c-fos homology region. A 502-bp fragment containing these motifs mediated transcriptional activation by Tax1 or by serum in a transient transfection assay. Three independent Tax1-responsive regions (TRRs) were identified, and mutations in each revealed that one of the retinoblastoma control elements in TRR1 and the c-fos AP-1 sites in TRR2 and TRR3 were essential for the activation. Although TRR2 contains a CArG box-like sequence, it was a weak binding site for p67SRF, if it bound at all, and was not required for activation. All three TRRs could also mediate the signals stimulated by serum. Thus, Tax1 appears to activate fra-1 gene expression by means of a part of the cellular machinery similar to that which mediates growth signals.","['Tsuchiya, H', 'Fujii, M', 'Niki, T', 'Tokuhara, M', 'Matsui, M', 'Seiki, M']","['Tsuchiya H', 'Fujii M', 'Niki T', 'Tokuhara M', 'Matsui M', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Cancer Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Genome, Human', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.12.7001-7007.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Dec;67(12):7001-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.12.7001-7007.1993.,"['fra-1', 'tax']",['GENBANK/D16365'],,PMC238160,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies, however, include long-term survivors, and none report risk for second cancer among NHL patients surviving 15 or more years. PURPOSE: Our aim was to examine the pattern of second cancers among long-term survivors of NHL. METHODS: A cohort of 6171 patients diagnosed with NHL as a first primary cancer and who survived 2 or more years was identified within population-based tumor registries in Sweden, Ontario, and Iowa and within the affiliated tumor registry of The Netherlands Cancer Institute. Nearly 1000 NHL patients lived 15 or more years after diagnosis. Tumor registry files were searched for new invasive primary malignancies. RESULTS: Second cancers were reported in 541 subjects (observed-to-expected ratio [O/E] = 1.37; 95% confidence interval = 1.26-1.49), with significant excesses seen for all solid tumors (O/E = 1.28), acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (O/E = 4.83), melanoma (O/E = 2.38), Hodgkin's disease (O/E = 12.0), and cancers of the lung (O/E = 1.36), brain (O/E = 2.33), kidney (O/E = 2.07), and bladder (O/E = 1.77). Among 15-year survivors, significantly increased risks persisted for all second cancers (O/E = 1.45), solid tumors (O/E = 1.37), bladder cancer (O/E = 3.24), and Hodgkin's disease (O/E = 25.0). The actuarial risk of developing a second cancer 3-20 years after diagnosis of NHL was 21%, compared with a population expected cumulative risk of 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NHL continue to be at significantly elevated risk of second primary cancer for up to two decades following diagnosis. The pattern of risk suggests the influence of treatment as well as factors associated with the underlying disease. IMPLICATIONS: Quantitative studies of second cancer following NHL are needed to clarify the role of antecedent therapy, shared risk factors, host susceptibility, and other etiologic and diagnostic influences. Despite the generally advanced age of patients with NHL, the persistently elevated risk of second cancers should alert clinicians to the importance of continued medical surveillance.","['Travis, L B', 'Curtis, R E', 'Glimelius, B', 'Holowaty, E', 'Van Leeuwen, F E', 'Lynch, C F', 'Adami, J', 'Gospodarowicz, M', 'Wacholder, S', 'Inskip, P']","['Travis LB', 'Curtis RE', 'Glimelius B', 'Holowaty E', 'Van Leeuwen FE', 'Lynch CF', 'Adami J', 'Gospodarowicz M', 'Wacholder S', 'Inskip P', 'et al.']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Registries']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.23.1932 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Dec 1;85(23):1932-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.23.1932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, continuous oral dosing results in progressive decline in plasma drug concentrations, which is associated with relapse and resistance to this retinoid. We speculated that the decline in drug levels, indicating acquired resistance, resulted partly from inducible cytochrome-P450 oxidative enzymes, which can catabolize all-trans RA. PURPOSE: We studied the clinical pharmacology of all-trans RA in cancer patients to determine possible mechanisms of acquired resistance and evaluated the potential for reversal by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome-P450 oxidative enzymes. METHODS: Serial plasma samples were obtained from 54 patients with APL or advanced lung cancer after a single oral dose of all-trans RA (45 mg/m2). In the 34 patients with advanced lung cancer, all-trans RA (45 mg/m2) was administered twice daily for 4 weeks, and, on days 2, 28, and 29, serial plasma samples were again obtained after a single 45-mg/m2 dose. One hour prior to drug administration on days 2 and 29, a single oral dose (200-1200 mg) of ketoconazole was administered. Endogenous plasma concentrations of all-trans RA and 13-cis-retinoic acid were measured in a subset of these patients and in 11 with early-stage lung cancer. RESULTS: The mean area under the curve for plasma drug concentration times time (AUC) for all-trans RA on day 1 varied substantially among patients. Compared with patients with APL, the 28 patients with advanced lung cancer who completed therapy demonstrated significantly lower AUC levels on day 1 (P = .06); a subgroup with levels less than 300 ng/mL per hour on day 1 had lower endogenous plasma all-trans RA concentrations than patients with APL or early-stage lung cancer or 14 normal subjects. Following continuous oral treatment, the mean day 28 AUC for all-trans RA was significantly lower than that on day 1 (213 ng/mL per hour versus 467 ng/mL per hour; P < .01), a decline significantly attenuated by ketoconazole, which increased the mean plasma all-trans RA AUC on day 29 to 375 ng/mL per hour (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Reported variability for the pharmacokinetics of all-trans RA may result from disease-related or population-based differences in basal catabolic rates influenced by genetic or environmental factors. However, the pattern of inducible catabolism of all-trans RA is not disease specific. Ketoconazole attenuates this accelerated catabolism, suggesting that oxidation by cytochrome-P450 enzymes is an important pathway for both constitutive and induced pathways of all-trans RA metabolism.","['Rigas, J R', 'Francis, P A', 'Muindi, J R', 'Kris, M G', 'Huselton, C', 'DeGrazia, F', 'Orazem, J P', 'Young, C W', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Rigas JR', 'Francis PA', 'Muindi JR', 'Kris MG', 'Huselton C', 'DeGrazia F', 'Orazem JP', 'Young CW', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, N.Y. 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",1993/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.23.1921 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Dec 1;85(23):1921-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.23.1921.,,,,,,"['CA05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FDR000674/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) from Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), rat liver (RL), and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei); as inhibitors of T. gondii and P. carinii cell growth in culture; and as antitumor agents. The compounds were prepared by modifications of procedures for classical 5-deaza folates. 2,4-Diamino-5-methyl-6-[(3',4',5'-trimethoxy-N- methylanilino)methyl]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (5a) exhibited high potency as well as selectivity (compared to RL DHFR) for P. carinii and T. gondii DHFR.

The neutrophil stimulating activity in these plants was also examined by measuring superoxide production. Both activities are known to be possessed by tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Dried parts of Iridaceae plants were extracted with methanol. Then, each extract was added to a culture medium of HL-60 cells and cultured for two days. A morphological change of the cells from suspended to adherent state, which was reported to occur in the process of differentiation, was observed. Nine species, most of which belong to the Iris genus, had the activity to cause cell adhesion. Each of the cell adhesion-positive extract was applied to a silica gel column and eluted with chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol in order. The activity was recovered only in the ethyl acetate eluate in all the cases. Those partially purified fractions also activated superoxide generation of neutrophils. When ethyl acetate fractions of Iris tectorum and Iris japonica were analyzed by HPLC, three active peaks different from TPA and teleocidins in UV spectra were detected. From these results, it was suggested that several plants of Iridaceae may contain TPA-type and yet structurally-different tumor promoters.","['Takahashi, K', 'Ishino, M', 'Hoshino, Y', 'Tokumaru, Y', 'Suzuki, S']","['Takahashi K', 'Ishino M', 'Hoshino Y', 'Tokumaru Y', 'Suzuki S']","['Saitama Prefectural Institute of Public Health, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/yakushi1947.113.9_647 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 1993 Sep;113(9):647-54. doi: 10.1248/yakushi1947.113.9_647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Response to other antiemetics in eight children refusing random assignment to treatment was also evaluated. All children were receiving intravenous infusions of teniposide plus cytarabine, the pharmacokinetics of which were characterized for each of the one to four courses. There were no differences between the 11 patients randomly assigned to receive chlorpromazine alone and the 14 randomly assigned to receive lorazepam plus chlorpromazine in the number of emesis episodes (6.0 vs 5.9; p = 0.53), frequency of dystonic reactions (3% vs 5%), or akathisia (13 vs 10%). The only serious adverse event, symptomatic hypotension, occurred in a boy receiving chlorpromazine plus lorazepam. An exploratory pharmacodynamic analysis revealed that the only variable that correlated with vomiting was cytarabine 1 1/2-hour plasma concentration (p = 0.007). Children who received either chlorpromazine plus lorazepam or chlorpromazine alone had fewer episodes of vomiting than those who received ""conventional"" antiemetic therapy (6.0 vs 8.6; p = 0.01). We conclude that the severity of emesis is related to the plasma concentration of cytarabine; that intravenously administered chlorpromazine is as effective as chlorpromazine plus lorazepam in preventing chemotherapy-induced vomiting; and that the potential for adverse effects with the addition of lorazepam may be a disadvantage.","['Relling, M V', 'Mulhern, R K', 'Fairclough, D', 'Baker, D', 'Pui, C H']","['Relling MV', 'Mulhern RK', 'Fairclough D', 'Baker D', 'Pui CH']","[""Pharmaceutical Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'O26FZP769L (Lorazepam)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antiemetics/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chlorpromazine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lorazepam/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vomiting/etiology/*prevention & control']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)80866-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80866-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1993 Nov;123(5):811-6. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80866-2.,,,,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCIPO1 CA-201805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate (E) shows interesting activity. This compound inhibited growth of HL-60 cells with almost the same potency of retinoic acid. However, unlike retinoic acid, the potency of this compound to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells into neutrophiles was almost negligible. Ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate (E) is an unprecedented retinoid which inhibits growth of HL-60 cells without inducing cell differentiation. The Z isomer [ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate (Z)] also showed similar unique effects on HL-60 cells. Interestingly, both of the E and Z isomers of alpha-retinylidene propionic acid showed only very weak activities to inhibit growth and to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells. It was suggested that ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate acts on HL-60 cells in the intact form without suffering hydrolysis, and also that the ester group plays important role for the unique activity. Biological activities of retinylidene acetic acid (E and Z) which lacks methyl group at alpha-position of alpha-retinylidene propionic acid, on HL-60 cells were weaker than those of the isomers of alpha-retinylidene propionic acid. Esterification of the isomers of retinylidene acetic acid resulted in further decrease of biological activities. Biological activities of ethyl retinoate on HL-60 cells were also very weak. It was indicated that methyl group present at alpha-position of ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate plays an important role for the unique biological activity. It was further indicated that the effect of esterification of carboxyl group of retinoids on the biological activity is not constant, but varies depending on the structure. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate (E) apparently did not influence the process of induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells into neutrophiles by retinoic acid. It was further shown that ethyl alpha-retinylidene propionate (E) prolongs the time necessary for induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells by retinoic acid, but does not influence the level of final rate of differentiation.","['Suzuki, T', 'Kawamura, S', 'Matsui, M', 'Murayama, A']","['Suzuki T', 'Kawamura S', 'Matsui M', 'Murayama A']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo),Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,0402640,['0 (Retinoids)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Retinoids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3177/jnsv.39.221 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 1993 Jun;39(3):221-33. doi: 10.3177/jnsv.39.221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following promising pilot experience, this study was conducted to determine the benefit and morbidity of two intensive experimental regimens, Reg A, based on the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 1976 regimen, and Reg B, the New York regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 1983 and November 1984, 217 eligible children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and unfavorable presenting features were entered and randomly assigned to receive Reg A, Reg B, or Reg C, the control regimen. Assignment to Reg C was halted in November 1984 after interim analyses showed an inferior outcome. Subsequently, between November 1984 and March 1987, an additional 328 patients were randomly allocated to receive Reg A or Reg B. RESULTS: The 7-year EFS rate was 63% (+/- 6%, 1 SD) for Reg A, 61% (+/- 6%) for Reg B, and 40% (+/- 6%) for Reg C (P < .006). The difference between Reg A or Reg B and Reg C remained greater than 20 percentage points for EFS at 7 years and 15 percentage points for survival. Relative to Reg C, patients on Reg A accrued 16.3 additional days of hospitalization on average and, on Reg B, 20.2 days. EFS and survival were similar on Reg A and Reg B, but Reg B required more days of parenteral therapy and greater exposure to anthracyclines and alkylating agents. CONCLUSION: Both Reg A and Reg B provided a better outcome than Reg C for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and unfavorable presenting features. Outcomes on Reg A and Reg B were similar. Use of the more effective but more toxic regimens resulted in 78 additional hospital days per relapse prevented on Reg A and 101 days on Reg B.

Side effects of appetite increase and weight gain at higher doses were predicted to have a negative effect on quality of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stage IV breast cancer patients were randomized to receive either 160, 800, or 1,600 mg/d of megestrol acetate. Quality of life was assessed in 131 patients at trial entry and at 1 and 3 months while on treatment, by telephone interview, using the following measures: the Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC), Rand Functional Limitations Scale, Rand Mental Health Inventory (MHI), the Body Image Subscale, and linear analog scales of drug side effects. RESULTS: At 3 months, women treated with 160 mg/d reported less severe side effects (P < .0005), better physical functioning (FLS, P < .0005), less psychologic distress (MHI, P = .008), and an improvement in overall quality of life (FLIC, P = .003) from the time of study entry as compared with those treated with 1,600 mg/d. Patients who received the 800-mg/d dose fell between the low- and high-dose arms in reported intensity of drug side effects, but responded similarly to those in the 160-mg/d group in terms of physical functioning, psychologic distress, and overall quality of life. CONCLUSION: Unless additional follow-up data demonstrate a survival advantage at higher doses, the 160-mg/d dose is optimal, achieving maximal treatment effect with the fewest side effects and better quality of life.","['Kornblith, A B', 'Hollis, D R', 'Zuckerman, E', 'Lyss, A P', 'Canellos, G P', 'Cooper, M R', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Phillips, C A', 'Abrams, J', 'Aisner, J']","['Kornblith AB', 'Hollis DR', 'Zuckerman E', 'Lyss AP', 'Canellos GP', 'Cooper MR', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Phillips CA', 'Abrams J', 'Aisner J', 'et al.']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center/Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EA6LD1M70M (Megestrol)', 'TJ2M0FR8ES (Megestrol Acetate)']",IM,"['Appetite/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Megestrol/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Megestrol Acetate', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Weight Gain/drug effects']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.11.2081 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Nov;11(11):2081-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.11.2081.,,,,,,"['CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The patients consisted of 65 dialysis patients (57 on haemodialysis and 8 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) and 71 leukaemia patients in long-term remission [49 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 22 with acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL)]. The presence of anti-HCV was investigated using a second generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive samples were confirmed by a second generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Anti-HBc was studied in the 65 dialysis patients and in 40 of the leukaemia patients. Three (4.6%) of the 65 dialysis patients and 12 (24.5%) of the 49 AML patients were anti-HCV positive whereas all of the ALL patients were seronegative.

The impaired response in null mutant mice could be rescued by introduction of a functional Pim-1 transgene. Moreover, overexpression of Pim-1 facilitates the derivation of primitive lymphoid cell lines that are dependent on combined stimulation with IL-7 and SF or insulin-like growth factor 1.

One immediate consequence of T cell activation via the TCR is an increase in cytosolic calcium. Calcium signals are important for NFAT induction, and recent studies have identified calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin dependent serine-threonine phosphatase, as a prominent component of the calcium signaling pathway in T cells. A second important molecule in TCR signal transduction is the guanine nucleotide binding protein, p21ras, which is coupled to the TCR by a protein tyrosine kinase dependent mechanism. The experiments presented here show that expression by transfection of mutationally activated calcineurin or activated p21ras alone is insufficient for NFAT transactivation. However, coexpression of the activated calcineurin with activated p21ras could mimic TCR signals in NFAT induction. These data identify calcineurin and p21ras as cooperative partners in T cell activation.","['Woodrow, M', 'Clipstone, N A', 'Cantrell, D']","['Woodrow M', 'Clipstone NA', 'Cantrell D']","['Lymphocyte Activation Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcineurin', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.178.5.1517 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Nov 1;178(5):1517-22. doi: 10.1084/jem.178.5.1517.,,,,PMC2191221,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we show that IL-10 also promotes DNA synthesis and IgM production by anti-CD40 activated B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Most strikingly, IL-2 and IL-10 were found to synergize to induce the proliferation and differentiation of B-CLL cells. This synergy between IL-2 and IL-10 was also observed with normal B cells which proliferated strongly and secreted large amounts of IgM, IgG, and IgA. The observed synergy is likely to be due to the IL-10-induced increase of high affinity IL-2 receptors on both normal and leukemic B cells. This increase of high affinity receptor is associated to an increase of Tac/CD25 expression that can be detected by flow cytometric analysis. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 permits anti-CD40 activated B cells to respond to IL-2 through an induction of high affinity IL-2 receptors. This effect of IL-10 may partly explain how T cells, which activate B cells in a CD40-dependent fashion, induce B cell proliferation and differentiation mostly through IL-2.","['Fluckiger, A C', 'Garrone, P', 'Durand, I', 'Galizzi, J P', 'Banchereau, J']","['Fluckiger AC', 'Garrone P', 'Durand I', 'Galizzi JP', 'Banchereau J']","['Laboratory for Immunological Research, Schering-Plough, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.178.5.1473 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Nov 1;178(5):1473-81. doi: 10.1084/jem.178.5.1473.,,,,PMC2191252,,,,,,,,,,,,,

European Community Working Party.,320-5,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The main aim was to detect known relationships between lung and blood cancers and various occupational exposures (using job titles as proxies) using a case-control design. The suitability of this system for routine surveillance could then be assessed. DESIGN: A case-control study was carried out in 1989. SETTING: Hospitals in eight European Community countries. SUBJECTS: Men aged 25 to 75 years with incident and prevalent cancer of the lung (190 cases), haematopoietic system (210 cases), or gastrointestinal tract (245 controls) were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The crude estimate of the overall odds ratio exposure (OR) for relevant occupational exposure of lung cancer relative to gastrointestinal cancer was 1.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 1.77). In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for country, age at diagnosis, smoking, and alcohol consumption, the overall OR was not greatly changed. A significant interaction of occupational exposure and age at diagnosis showed that lung cancer patients diagnosed at a younger age had a higher OR than patients diagnosed at an older age. Thus, the overall, insignificant result may have been due to a low reliability of occupational history in older age or to a selective mechanism related to age. The overall OR for occupational exposure of cancer of the blood relative to gastrointestinal cancer was 0.88 (95% CI 0.60, 1.31). The logistic regression analysis did not alter these results. CONCLUSION: A surveillance based on a case-control design using job titles would not be sensitive enough to detect possible occupational risks.","['Rona, R J', 'Taub, N A', 'Rasmussen, S']","['Rona RJ', 'Taub NA', 'Rasmussen S']","[""Department of Public Health Medicine, United Medical School, St Thomas's Hospital, London.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'European Union', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Population Surveillance/*methods']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.47.4.320 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1993 Aug;47(4):320-5. doi: 10.1136/jech.47.4.320.,,,,PMC1059802,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional capabilities of undifferentiated HL60 cells have not been similarly characterized due to the absence of the cell surface receptors required to initiate these processes. To investigate these properties, undifferentiated HL60 cells were transfected with one of the better characterized neutrophil chemotactic receptors, the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR). Expression of the recombinant FPR gene product in FPR-transfected HL60 cells and the absence of the endogenous FPR in vector-transfected HL60 cells was demonstrated by Northern blot and flow cytometric analyses. FPR-transfected HL60 cells retained their ability to undergo granulocytic differentiation with dibutyryl cAMP, as determined by FMLP- and PMA-stimulated superoxide production. Furthermore, incubation of FPR-transfected HL60 cells for 5 days in the presence of FMLP resulted in limited differentiation as evidenced by the expression of functional C5a receptors. Binding studies of FPR-transfected HL60 cells demonstrated the presence of two binding affinities with dissociation constants of 0.6 and 33 nM, similar to dibutyryl cAMP differentiated HL60 cells and human neutrophils but contrasting the single high affinity state of the FPR expressed in mouse L cell fibroblasts. FPR-transfected HL60 cells displayed FMLP-dependent calcium mobilization with an EC50 of 3 nM and actin polymerization with an EC50 of approximately 10 nM. Actin polymerization was not observed in FPR-transfected L cell fibroblasts or undifferentiated vector-transfected HL60 cells. Both calcium mobilization and actin polymerization were sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin, indicating the requirement for a Gi-like protein. Stimulation of either undifferentiated or differentiated HL60 cells with ATP resulted in pertussis toxin-insensitive calcium mobilization but was ineffective in producing actin polymerization. The results described herein show for the first time that undifferentiated HL60 cells can respond to chemoattractant receptor stimulation with many of the properties of the mature neutrophil. Transfected HL60 cells will provide an excellent system to study the characteristics of chemotactic receptors as well as the functional properties of myeloid cells.","['Prossnitz, E R', 'Quehenberger, O', 'Cochrane, C G', 'Ye, R D']","['Prossnitz ER', 'Quehenberger O', 'Cochrane CG', 'Ye RD']","['Department of Immunology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/genetics/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Nov 15;151(10):5704-15.,['FPR'],,,,,"['AI33503/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46572/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the regulatory effect of ADF on eosinophil migration using human eosinophils and an eosinophilic subline of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, YY-1. rADF induced migration of eosinophils from patients with hypereosinophilia, although rADF exhibited little activity on eosinophils from healthy donors. When human eosinophils were incubated with rADF (0.1-10 micrograms/ml) at 37 degrees C for 24 h, both chemotactic and chemokinetic activity of the complement anaphylatoxin peptide C5a on eosinophil migration was markedly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, this enhancing effect of rADF was observed in the migration assay using YY-1 cells. In contrast, rADF showed no modulation of migratory behavior of human eosinophils and YY-1 cells by IL-3, IL-5, nor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Scatchard analysis of C5a receptors on YY-1 cells using 125I-C5a showed that rADF modulated neither the density nor the affinity of the cell membrane significantly. Furthermore, mutant ADF (mADF), which had no reducing activity, had no enhancing effect on C5a-induced eosinophil migration. These results indicate a possible involvement of ADF in the recruitment of eosinophils through redox regulation by a dithiol reductase activity.","['Hori, K', 'Hirashima, M', 'Ueno, M', 'Matsuda, M', 'Waga, S', 'Tsurufuji, S', 'Yodoi, J']","['Hori K', 'Hirashima M', 'Ueno M', 'Matsuda M', 'Waga S', 'Tsurufuji S', 'Yodoi J']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Cytokines', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Nov 15;151(10):5624-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of the role of tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, leukemia inhibiting factor, and IFN-gamma.",5554-62,"TNF, a primary mediator of the response to infection, can be injurious to the organism when present in excessive quantities. Circulating soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR) appear to represent a natural mechanism that protects against circulating TNF. Two soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR-P55 and sTNFR-P75) circulate in vivo and are up-regulated in response to endotoxin. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of LPS-induced sTNFR release and the role of the cytokines TNF, leukemia inhibiting factor, IFN-gamma, and IL-1 in this process. The results show that LPS injection results in a rapid increase in levels of both sTNFR. Although sTNFR-P55 decreases after a peak at 30 min, sTNFR-P75 levels show a peak after 4 to 8 h, after which they slowly diminish. Both human TNF and murine TNF are capable of increasing levels of both sTNFR. Blocking circulating TNF by administration of 3 different anti-TNF agents before LPS injection (mAb to murine TNF, sTNFR55-Fc or sTNFR75-Fc) results in a significant increase of sTNFR-P55 levels, whereas only both sTNFR-Fc constructs also significantly increase sTNFR-P75 levels. Although IL-1 receptor antagonist pretreatment before LPS has no effect on TNF or sTNFR levels, leukemia inhibiting factor pretreatment significantly increases sTNFR-P55 levels. Pretreatment with anti IFN-gamma mAb before LPS results in a significant reduction in TNF and sTNFR-P55 levels, but sTNFR-P75 levels are significantly increased. Our data show that both sTNFR can be up-regulated by LPS and TNF. The influence of TNF, leukemia inhibiting factor, IL-1, and IFN-gamma on the kinetics of LPS-induced circulating sTNFR is discussed in the context of the pathophysiology of LPS-induced disease.","['Bemelmans, M H', 'Gouma, D J', 'Buurman, W A']","['Bemelmans MH', 'Gouma DJ', 'Buurman WA']","['Department of Surgery, Faculty II, University of Limburg, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Nov 15;151(10):5554-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Biopsy specimens before and after treatment were studied from patients diagnosed as having acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukaemia. Specimens after treatment encompassed periods from two to 56 weeks from the start of treatment. Routine haematoxylin and eosin and Giemsa stained sections were evaluated in association with immunostained preparations. A panel of antibodies was used, which reacts with epitopes showing restricted expression dependent on the lineage or maturation stage of cells. Results were evaluated in the light of clinical, peripheral blood, and marrow aspirate findings. RESULTS: The speed and sequence of regrowth of haemopoietic cells were more variable than expected. Immunostaining highlighted features of dysplasia after treatment and in some cases assisted detection of residual or relapsed leukaemia. Peripheral blood and aspirate cell counts reflected accurately the amount of regrowth, but not the dysplasia, seen in biopsy samples. Delayed regrowth was associated with complex individual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Morphological and immunohistochemical study of trephine biopsy specimens from patients treated for acute leukaemia provides information complementary to that obtained from peripheral blood and aspirated marrow. Variation in the timing and sequence of regrowth is highlighted. Immunostaining can aid in the detection of relapse or minimal residual leukaemia. The clinical relevance of dysplastic changes in biopsy specimens after treatment is uncertain, but such changes may persist for long periods.","['Wilkins, B S', 'Bostanci, A G', 'Ryan, M F', 'Jones, D B']","['Wilkins BS', 'Bostanci AG', 'Ryan MF', 'Jones DB']","['Department of Pathology, Southampton General Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.46.10.915 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1993 Oct;46(10):915-21. doi: 10.1136/jcp.46.10.915.,,,,PMC501618,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Blast cells from 14 cases of biphenotypic acute leukaemia were analysed. Immunological markers were performed by single or double immunofluorescence staining on a flow cytometer. The presence of MPO was determined by light microscopy, electron microscopy on fixed and unfixed cells, and by immunoalkaline phosphatase with an anti-MPO antibody. The immunogold method was applied at the ultrastructural level to assess the expression of lymphoid and myeloid antigens at the same time as the MPO activity. RESULTS: Six of the 14 cases were initially classified as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and eight as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). MPO activity was shown at the ultrastructural level in 4-99% blasts from all cases. Six of the 14 were MPO negative by light microscopy and three of these were negative with the antibody anti-MPO. Coexpression of lymphoid antigens (CD19, CD10, or CD2) and MPO was shown by the immunogold method in four out of 11 cases; in seven cases the blasts coexpressed myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33) and MPO.

IL-6 mRNA was not detectable in tumor cells by Northern blotting, but was evident using PCR amplification. Although intracytoplasmic IL-6 protein was not demonstrable, HCs did secrete low levels of IL-6. Neutralizing antibody to IL-6 did not inhibit HC DNA synthesis. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a growth factor for HCL, we determined whether the TNF effect could be IL-6-mediated. TNF markedly augmented in vitro DNA synthesis by HCs. TNF did not alter IL-6R expression or IL-6 binding; however, IL-6 mRNA and IL-6 protein were detectable after 3-d culture of HCs with TNF. In addition, IL-6 secretion by HCs was markedly augmented by TNF. Finally, although neither IL-6 nor anti-IL-6 antibody altered TNF-induced DNA synthesis by HCs, IL-6 antisense oligonucleotide inhibited TNF-induced DNA synthesis and IL-6 secretion by HCs.

Nuclear matrix is formed by interactions between specific stretches of DNA of about 0.1 to 5.0 kb with protein transcription factors, nuclear enzymes, and structural proteins. Nuclear matrix is believed to be the exclusive nuclear microenvironment in which initiation of DNA replication, transcription, and repair take place. The matrix attachment regions (MARs) of DNA have transcriptional enhancer activity, harbor the origins of replication of the human genome, and define the borders between neighboring chromatin loops. In this study we report the sequence of the human MAR fragment 19.2 of a size of 542 bp. Hum. MAR 19.2 is composed of TG-, CA-, CT-, and GA-rich blocks and shows 8 perfect and imperfect inverted repeats. Thus, we have identified a novel class of MARs with sequence characteristics divergent from the AT-rich class of MARs.

Adding a monoclonal antibody with specificity for the c-fms gene product to cells treated with various inducers of myelomonocytic or macrophage differentiation, including retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, inhibited the rate of differentiation. During the period of inducer treatment usually preceding onset of differentiation, longer periods of antibody exposure caused greater inhibition of differentiation. In a stable HL-60 transfectant overexpressing the CSF-1 receptor at the cell surface due to a constitutively driven c-fms trans gene, the rate of differentiation was enhanced compared to the wild type cell, consistent with a positive regulatory role for the CSF-1 receptor. The anti-fms antibody caused much less inhibition of differentiation in the transfectants than in wild type cells, consistent with a larger number of receptors causing reduced sensitivity. During the induced metabolic cascade leading to differentiation, the typical early down regulation of RB gene expression was inhibited by the antibody. The antibody itself caused an increase in RB expression per cell, which offset the decrease normally caused by differentiation inducers (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and retinoic acid). The changes in RB expression preceded changes in the RB protein to the hypophosphorylated state. Most of the RB protein in proliferating cells was phosphorylated and no significant accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB protein occurred until after onset of G0 arrest. Thus the metabolic cascade leading to myelomonocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells appears to be driven by a function of the c-fms protein. Inhibiting that process by attacking this receptor impedes differentiation and also compromises the early down regulation of RB tumor suppressor gene expression which normally precedes differentiation. These findings provide additional support for a potential role for down regulating RB expression in promoting cell differentiation, and suggest the possibility that RB may be either a target or intermediate mediator of CSF-1 actions.","['Yen, A', 'Forbes, M E', 'Varvayanis, S', 'Tykocinski, M L', 'Groger, R K', 'Platko, J D']","['Yen A', 'Forbes ME', 'Varvayanis S', 'Tykocinski ML', 'Groger RK', 'Platko JD']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Monocytes/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/immunology/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041570222 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Nov;157(2):379-91. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041570222.,"['RB', 'c-fms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is presumed, therefore, that such cells are ""primed"" to apoptosis in that no new protein synthesis is required for induction of their death. We have studied apoptosis of HL-60 cells triggered by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CAM) in the absence and presence of CHX and apoptosis induced by CHX alone. Two different flow cytometric methods were used, each allowing us to relate the apoptosis-associated DNA degradation to the cell cycle position. Apoptosis induced by CAM was limited to S phase cells, e.g., at a CAM concentration of 0.15 microM, nearly 90% of the S phase cells underwent apoptosis after 4 h. In contrast, apoptosis triggered by CHX was indiscriminate, affecting all phases of the cycle: approximately 40% of the cells from each phase the cycle underwent apoptosis at 5 microM CHX concentration. When CAM and CHX were added together, the pattern of apoptosis resembled that of cycloheximide alone, namely, cells in all phases of the cycle in similar proportion were affected. Thus, CHX, while itself inducing apoptosis of a fraction of cells, protected the S phase cells against apoptosis triggered by CAM. Because CHX (5 microM) did not significantly affect the rate of cell progression through S phase, the observed protective effect was most likely directly related to inhibition of protein synthesis, rather than to its possible indirect effect on DNA replication. Furthermore, whereas apoptosis (DNA degradation) triggered by CAM was prevented by the serine protease inhibitor N-tosyl-L-lysylchloromethyl ketone (TLCK), this process was actually potentiated by this inhibitor when induced by CHX. The present data indicate differences in mechanism of apoptosis triggered by CAM (and perhaps other antitumor drugs) as compared with CHX. Apoptosis caused by CHX may be unique in that it may not involve new protein synthesis. These data are compatible with the assumption that the loss of a hypothetical, rapidly turning over suppressor of apoptosis may be the trigger of apoptosis of HL-60 cells treated with CHX, whereas de novo protein synthesis is required when apoptosis is triggered by other agents.","['Gong, J', 'Li, X', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Gong J', 'Li X', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['2104-86-1 (Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'S Phase', 'Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041570208 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Nov;157(2):263-70. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041570208.,,,,,,['NCI RO1 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

E., Chatterjee, S., Chaudhuri, M., and White, M. F. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 2027-2031). In this study, YMXM-containing peptides are shown to act as substrates for two members of the nonreceptor subfamily of tyrosine kinases, v-Src and v-Abl (the transforming gene products of Rous sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus, respectively). For v-Src, a baculovirus expression system was used which was capable of producing milligram quantities of pure 60-kDa v-Src in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The source of v-Abl was an Escherichia coli expression vector that produces a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase with the abl catalytic domain. The synthetic YMXM-containing peptides had among the highest apparent affinities described to date for either tyrosine kinase, with Km values as low as 97 microM for v-Src and v-Abl. Comparisons with the results obtained with the insulin receptor kinase revealed differences in substrate specificity among the enzymes. In particular, v-Src was more tolerant of substitutions at the Met+1 and Met+3 positions in the YMXM motif than either v-Abl or the insulin receptor kinase but was more dependent on the presence of a preceding acidic amino acid. For v-Abl, the presence of threonine at any position in the YMXM motif caused a reduction in catalytic efficiency. Phosphorylated YMXM motifs are recognition elements for binding to the src homology 2 domains of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and additional proteins; hence, differences in specificity of tyrosine kinases toward YMXM-containing proteins may have relevance to downstream signaling events.","['Garcia, P', 'Shoelson, S E', 'George, S T', 'Hinds, D A', 'Goldberg, A R', 'Miller, W T']","['Garcia P', 'Shoelson SE', 'George ST', 'Hinds DA', 'Goldberg AR', 'Miller WT']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine, State University of New York, Stony Brook 11794.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moths', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1993/11/25 00:00,1993/11/25 00:01,['1993/11/25 00:00'],"['1993/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)74581-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Nov 25;268(33):25146-51.,"['src', 'v-Abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine did not inhibit phosphorylation of ET-FR but blocked the fast migrating component of phosphorylated ET-C5aR. Homologous desensitization correlated with ligand-induced phosphorylation of both receptors. Of note, ET-C5aR but not ET-FR underwent heterologous desensitization by antigen, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and thrombin.

To date, very little is known about its biochemical target. In this study, we found that beta-lapachone inhibits the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I from calf thymus and human cells. But, unlike camptothecin, beta-lapachone does not stabilize the cleavable complex, indicating a different mechanism of action. beta-Lapachone inhibits topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage induced by camptothecin. Incubation of topoisomerase I with beta-lapachone before adding DNA substrate dramatically increases this inhibition. Incubation of topoisomerase I with DNA prior to beta-lapachone makes the enzyme refractory, and treatment of DNA with beta-lapachone before topoisomerase has no effect. These results suggest a direct interaction of beta-lapachone with topoisomerase I rather than DNA substrate. beta-Lapachone does not inhibit binding of enzyme to DNA substrate. In cells, beta-lapachone itself does not induce a SDS-K(+)-precipitable complex, but it inhibits complex formation with camptothecin.

M., Fager, R. S., and Reddy, G. P. V. (1990) Mol. Pharmacol. 38, 114-120). The veracity of the TS assay (known as the tritium release assay) employed in these experiments may be compromised, however, because it requires the S phase-specific enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) to phosphorylate the substrate [5-3H]dUrd. In our study, this problem was further illustrated as the phosphorylated products of [14C]dCyd and [6-3H]dUrd were simultaneously quantitated to determine the activities of TS, TK, and dCyd kinase in intact CCRF-CEM cells. TS and dCyd kinase were unaffected by aphidicolin, hydroxyurea, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, whereas TK was strongly inhibited by these agents. Elevation of the cellular dTTP pool that accompanied drug treatment was not the primary mechanism affecting TK activity because incubation of cells with dCyd elevated the dTTP pool to similar levels, but did not inhibit TK to the same extent as did the drugs. Furthermore, after cells were washed from aphidicolin, [6-3H]dCyd incorporation, which primarily labels dTMP in DNA, proceeded at a linear rate, whereas a lag period of 15 min was observed before [3H]dThd was incorporated at a linear rate. These results suggest that TK activity is affected by more than one mechanism in intact cells. Because the activities of dCyd kinase and dCMP deaminase do not fluctuate as much as that of TK in response to changes in DNA synthesis activity and cell cycle, dCyd incorporation appears to be a more reliable assay of TS in intact cells than does dUrd incorporation. Our findings also imply that [3H]dThd incorporation assays may overestimate inhibition of DNA synthesis.","['Xu, Y Z', 'Plunkett, W']","['Xu YZ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

Since this latter situation may not always occur, it would be of practical benefit to have a form of supplementation that is effective and can be taken without side effects.

The effects of a system known to produce the OH. radicals were tested on HL-60 cells cultured under optimum conditions for 96 hr. Hydroxyl radicals were generated by a Fenton reaction, involving an ADP-Fe2+ (or ATP-Fe2+) complex and H2O2. Changes induced by OH. were compared to the effects of DMSO-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cell numbers, viability, thymidine incorporation, TPA-induced NBT reduction and propidium iodide staining in flow cytometry were determined. The OH. generating system inhibited the growth and thymidine incorporation of leukemic cells in a manner dependent on the dose of added H2O2 (from 0.005 to 0.05 mM). In addition, an increasing proportion of the treated cells displayed signs of cell differentiation. In DMSO-treated cells, SOD and catalase activities increased after 6 days of culturing. The results show that a portion of the OH. free radicals derived from H2O2, produced by the action of SOD, may be a necessary prerequisite for differentiation, whereas an overproduction of OH. causes cell lethality or aging. We suggest that OH. free radicals may have a more complex role in cell physiology than simply causing oxidative damage.","['Nagy, K', 'Pasti, G', 'Bene, L', 'Zs-Nagy, I']","['Nagy K', 'Pasti G', 'Bene L', 'Zs-Nagy I']","['Verzar International Laboratory for Experimental Gerontology (VILEG), Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Free Radic Res Commun,Free radical research communications,8709453,"[""0 (Fenton's reagent)"", '0 (Free Radicals)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyl Radical/*metabolism', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Models, Biological', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10715769309056494 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res Commun. 1993;19(1):1-15. doi: 10.3109/10715769309056494.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immediate and fast ionic fluxes in Friend erythroleukemic cells (FELC), erythrocytes and Staphylococcus aureus during short intervals of porphyrin mediated photosensitization were determined uniquely by X-ray microanalysis (XRMA) combined with electron microscopy. 2. Photodynamic inactivation of FELC was mediated by either endogenous protoporphyrin induced by 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA), or Photofrin-II. We describe the predominant phenomena of > 85% K-loss within 2-10 min of photoactivation. However the accompanied Na inflow and the collapse of the cellular balance of elemental-composition were inconsistent and acted as a function of cell damage. 3. Erythrocytes treated with hematoporphyrin (HP) lost most of their intracellular K yet instantly gained Na. Nevertheless the K/Na molar ratio of the control erythrocytes was nearly 12/1 while after photosensitization and K loss it changed to 1/1. 4. The S. aureus bacteria photosensitized with HP showed entire K-loss as well as marked Na efflux which increased with irradiation time; this was accompanied by the decline of other cell elements. 5. The prevailing K loss in FELC, erythrocytes and bacteria during the first minutes of photosensitization is deduced to be an immediate primary consequence of the photodynamic effect, while other ionic changes are joined in order with the development of cellular damage.","['Malik, Z', 'Babushkin, T', 'Sher, S', 'Hanania, J', 'Ladan, H', 'Nitzan, Y', 'Salzberg, S']","['Malik Z', 'Babushkin T', 'Sher S', 'Hanania J', 'Ladan H', 'Nitzan Y', 'Salzberg S']","['Life Sciences Department, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Biochem,The International journal of biochemistry,0250365,"['0 (Ions)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Ions', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0020-711x(93)90688-b [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biochem. 1993 Oct;25(10):1399-406. doi: 10.1016/0020-711x(93)90688-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to explore the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis in African trypanosomiasis, we studied the inhibition of host cell (human promyelocytic HL-60 cells) growth by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense using an in vitro system. This inhibition was not due to changes in pH or nutritional depletion of the culture medium by the trypanosomes as inhibitory activity was still observed in cultures that had been supplemented with glucose or fresh culture medium. Our study suggests that the African trypanosomes produce a soluble factor which inhibits the growth of HL-60 cells. This growth inhibitor does not appear to kill the HL-60 cells as determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. The production of this factor does not require host cell contact nor does it require a host cell cofactor. The trypanosome growth inhibitor is strictly a trypanosome product. Estimation of the molecular weight of the trypanosome growth inhibitor with Amicon filters revealed that the factor is greater than 30,000 Da in size. Protease and heat treatment of the factor resulted in the depletion of inhibitory activity.

The aim of this study was to determine the phospholipid pools from which the DAG is generated and to identify which phospholipase activities are regulated by the TCR. When CD45+ cells were pre-labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, CD3-antigen cross-linking stimulated negligible increases in both [3H]DAG and [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA). However, CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induced an increase of 300% in [3H]PA when the cells were permeabilized with streptolysin-O, and this correlated with increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Stimulation of [3H]PA production upon CD3 cross-linking was 77% lower in permeabilized CD45- cells than in CD45+ cells, consistent with the reduced activity of p59fyn in CD45- cells. The stimulated production of PA was not mediated by activation of phospholipase D (PLD), although the presence of a G-protein-regulated PLD activity was established. The CD3-induced increase in total inositol phosphates (InsP) in permeabilized cells was similar to the stimulated production of [3H]PA production in both CD45+ and CD45- cells. Dose-response curves for InsP and PA production triggered by CD3 mAb were super-imposable and the production of InsP and PA over a range of Ca2+ concentrations was comparable. Differential labeling of phospholipids with 3H-labeled fatty acids revealed that CD3-induced PA production reflected incorporation of label into the phosphatidylinositol pool. Our data suggest that in HPB-ALL cells the production of DAG following CD3-antigen cross-linking can be fully accounted for by the selective coupling of the TCR to breakdown of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate as the result of phospholipase C gamma 1 activation. This event correlates with the activity of the CD45-regulated TCR-associated tyrosine kinase, p59fyn.","['Biffen, M', 'Shiroo, M', 'Alexander, D R']","['Biffen M', 'Shiroo M', 'Alexander DR']","['AFRC Babraham Institute, Cambridge, GB.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Diglycerides/*biosynthesis', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Phosphatidic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830231138 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Nov;23(11):2980-7. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830231138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast in HTLV-1 infection no significant changes in allogeneic stimulation were seen but DC-stimulated activity of autologous T cells. In seeking animal models relevant to these diseases the effects of two murine leukemia retroviruses, Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV) and Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) on the function of dendritic cells and T cells in a primary mixed leucocyte reaction have been tested. Treatment by RLV in vitro suppressed the ability of DC to stimulate allogeneic T cells from healthy animals. MLV at the same concentration did not significantly affect the ability of DC to stimulate allogeneic T cells, but provoked considerable enhancement of the low level stimulation by DC in the syngeneic system. Similar results were obtained following in vivo exposure to viruses. Two pieces of evidence suggested that these effects were due to impairment of DC function and were not operating through infection of T cells. Firstly, exposure of T cells directly to virus in vitro and in vivo before stimulation with untreated allogeneic DC caused no significant alteration in T cell activity. Secondly, the impact of murine leukemia virus on DC function was not abrogated when infected DC were added to normal T cells and cultured in the presence of zidovudine. Treatment of DC by RLV caused a decrease of cluster formation with allogeneic T cells. No statistically significant influence of MLV was observed on cluster formation after 3-h of incubation in the allogeneic system. However, after 18-h incubation MLV-treated DC formed fewer clusters with T cells than untreated DC. At the same time a stimulatory effect of MLV on DC cluster formation with syngeneic T cells was found. Considerable decrease was found in major histocompatibility complex class II antigen and LFA-1 receptor expression on the DC surface in mice infected by RLV. MLV induced no significant changes. These mouse retroviruses can therefore cause changes in DC function similar to those already reported using human retroviruses and may provide models for studying their effects.","['Gabrilovich, D I', 'Roberts, M S', 'Harvey, J J', 'Botcherby, M', 'Bedford, P A', 'Knight, S C']","['Gabrilovich DI', 'Roberts MS', 'Harvey JJ', 'Botcherby M', 'Bedford PA', 'Knight SC']","['Antigen Presentation Group, Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, GB.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Immune Tolerance', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830231131 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Nov;23(11):2932-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830231131.,,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Hypercholesterolemia leads to a marked adhesion of circulating blood monocytes to arterial endothelial cells in vivo, and minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein enhances monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro. The activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is also important in the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein by endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated the role of PLA2 activation in the adhesion of a leukemic monocyte cell line (THP-1 cells) to endothelial cells in vitro using an adhesion assay and a cell-ELISA technique. The treatment of human umbilical-cord-vein endothelial cells with PLA2 stimulators such as interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor and lipopolysaccharide all increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to endothelial cells. Exogenous PLA2 also increased the adhesion of these cell types. The increased adhesion induced by these PLA2 stimulators, as well as PLA2 itself, was reversed by various inhibitors of the PLA2 reaction. A product of the PLA2 reaction, lysophosphatidylcholine, also increased cell adhesion. A cell-ELISA technique showed the enhanced expression of vascular-cell-adhesion-molecule 1 and intercellular-adhesion-molecule 1 to endothelial cells after treatment with PLA2 stimulators, PLA2 or lysophosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that the PLA2 reaction enhances monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells through the expression of cellular adhesion molecules.","['Yokote, K', 'Morisaki, N', 'Zenibayashi, M', 'Ueda, S', 'Kanzaki, T', 'Saito, Y', 'Yoshida, S']","['Yokote K', 'Morisaki N', 'Zenibayashi M', 'Ueda S', 'Kanzaki T', 'Saito Y', 'Yoshida S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Chiba University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Umbilical Cord']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18298.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Oct 15;217(2):723-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18298.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfection studies using the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene as a reporter gene with a series of promoter deletions revealed that the expression of the H1 zero gene may depend on a complex interplay of several transcription factors, including members of the retinoic acid and/or thyroid-hormone-receptor superfamily, at the 5' flanking region of the H1 zero gene. CAT assays demonstrate varied patterns of expression and regulation in different human tumor-cell lines. The leukemia cell line HL60 does not express H1 zero mRNA and shows no CAT activity. HeLa cells strongly express the CAT gene under the control of the H1 zero promoter. Under the same conditions, HepG2 cells also transcribe the CAT gene, although at a lower rate than HeLa cells. Using different promoter-deletion clones, the CAT activity differs in HepG2 and HeLa cells in the very distal promoter region. In both cell lines, the CAT activity decreases several fold when the region between nucleotides -450 and -600 upstream of the mRNA start site is deleted. It also decreases when just the proximal portion but not the distal promoter region is deleted.

Heterozygous mutant ES cells were used to generate chimeric mice from which pre-B cell lines were derived by transformation of bone marrow cells with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). Comparison of the rearrangement status of the normal and mutated alleles in individual pre-B cell lines allowed us to assay for cis-acting effects of the mutations. Replacement of a 700 bp region immediately downstream from the core E mu [which includes part of the 3' matrix associated region (MAR) and the I mu exon] had no obvious effect on rearrangement of the targeted allele, indicating that insertion of a transcribed neor gene into the JH-C mu intron does not affect JH accessibility. In contrast, replacement of an overlapping 1 kb DNA fragment that contains the E mu resulted in a dramatic cis-acting inhibition of rearrangement, demethylation and germline transcription of the associated JH locus. Surprisingly, insertion of the neor gene into the 5' MAR sequence approximately 100 bp upstream of the core E mu also dramatically decreased recombination of the linked JH locus; but, in many lines, did not prevent demethylation of this locus. We conclude that integrity of the E mu and upstream flanking sequences is required for efficient rearrangement of the JH locus and that demethylation of this locus, per se, does not necessarily make it a good substrate for VDJ recombination.","['Chen, J', 'Young, F', 'Bottaro, A', 'Stewart, V', 'Smith, R K', 'Alt, F W']","['Chen J', 'Young F', 'Bottaro A', 'Stewart V', 'Smith RK', 'Alt FW']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Introns', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Dec;12(12):4635-45.,,,,PMC413901,,"['AI20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI31541/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of the 21 bp enhancer of the HTLV-I provirus, this induction is correlated with the association of Tax1 with this DNA element via a specific cellular factor. That the indirect association of Tax1 with DNA can lead to transcriptional activation has also been supported by the study of chimeric GAL4-Tax1 proteins. The GAL4-Tax1 stimulatory effect exhibits a strong self-squelching. In order to determine whether Tax1 interacts directly with the general transcription factors or via intermediary molecules, we have analyzed how overexpression of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB protein affects the squelching curve of GAL4-Tax1. The data presented here show that overexpression of TBP strongly increases the stimulatory effect of GAL4-Tax1, causes a displacement of the maximum of the squelching curve and partially alleviates the squelching. Under similar conditions TFIIB exhibited little effect. From these results we conclude that Tax1 can increase the recruitment of TBP by directly interacting with this protein. Biochemical experiments with purified proteins produced in bacteria confirmed that Tax1 can interact with TBP but not with TFIIB. Tax1 interacts with the conserved C-terminal part of TBP. Analysis of the ability of different mutants of Tax1 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain to activate transcription and to associate with TBP, showed that these activities are correlated. However, since one transcriptionally inactive mutant was able to interact efficiently with TBP in vitro, it would appear that an event other than the Tax1-TBP contact also intervenes in the activation of transcription by Tax1.","['Caron, C', 'Rousset, R', 'Beraud, C', 'Moncollin, V', 'Egly, J M', 'Jalinot, P']","['Caron C', 'Rousset R', 'Beraud C', 'Moncollin V', 'Egly JM', 'Jalinot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, UMR 49, CNRS, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIIB)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIIB', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Nov;12(11):4269-78.,,,,PMC413723,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The size of the population over 65 years old is defined, with particular reference to the continuing growth of this subsection of the community. The high incidence of many cancers and their associated mortality rates in the elderly are identified and the epidemiology of such diseases in the geriatric population is addressed. Given the discrepancies in incidence and survival rates between patients younger and older than 65 years, the association between tumorigenesis and the aging process is explored. Specific aspects of tumor growth in the elderly are considered. General considerations of therapy for elderly patients with cancer are discussed, including the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of chemotherapy in those over 65 years old, surgical options, the use of radiotherapy, and overall patient assessment. Next, treatment options for individual cancer states are reviewed, with particular emphasis on newer treatment options designed specifically for the elderly. Sections on cancer screening and supportive care are also included, the latter dealing with aspects of symptom control, quality of life assessment, and the physical and psychologic rehabilitation of the elderly patient with cancer who is undergoing treatment. Conclusions are then drawn as to the extent of the oncological process in those over 65 years old, with particular emphasis on the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of many malignancies in the past. The challenge created by the growing elderly population is underscored and necessary plans of action for oncologists in the future are defined. Such proposals are necessary if inroads are to be made into the unacceptable morbidity and mortality rates borne by our elderly patients with cancer.","['Byrne, A', 'Carney, D N']","['Byrne A', 'Carney DN']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Mater Misericordiae Hospital Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/therapy']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0147-0272(93)90007-O [pii]', '10.1016/0147-0272(93)90007-o [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1993 May-Jun;17(3):145-218. doi: 10.1016/0147-0272(93)90007-o.,,,,,267,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We analysed 24-hour plasma ACTH and cortisol profiles sampled at 20-minute intervals. PATIENTS: Twenty long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were studied and results compared with those in 14 normal children. MEASUREMENTS: ACTH and cortisol profiles were analysed by Fourier transformation and spectral analysis of stationarized data, autocorrelation and coherency analysis. RESULTS: The normal circadian rhythms of ACTH and cortisol were preserved in the children after cranial irradiation. The median 0900 h and midnight values were 1.50(0.8-6.4)pmol/l and 1.0(0.6-3.7)pmol/l respectively for ACTH and 282(48-1913)nmol/l and 57.5(44-637)nmol/l respectively for cortisol, and were not significantly different from those in the normal group. Fourier transformation revealed dominant periodicities for ACTH at 0.7-1.1 h, equivalent to 22-34 ACTH secretory bursts per 24 hours, and for cortisol at 0.7-1.1 h and 2-4.8 h. Similar results were found in the normal group. Coherency analysis indicated a significant shared periodicity of 0.7-1.2 h in nine children, corresponding to 20-34 related secretory bursts in 24 hours for ACTH and cortisol. After pooling the coherency spectra in the cranially irradiated group, comparison with the pooled data from the normal group revealed no significant difference between the two groups in the relationship between the two hormones.

Using immuno- and Northern blot techniques, we have demonstrated that MELC express a pattern of PKC isoforms which includes PKC alpha, PKC delta, PKC epsilon, PKC zeta, and PKC eta. We show that MELC resistant to induction by HMBA express significantly less of the nPKC isoform, PKC delta, and slightly less PKC epsilon. Recovery of HMBA sensitivity is associated with reexpression of PKC delta protein. Upon exposure to HMBA, there is a fall in cytosolic PKC delta and PKC epsilon accompanied by a transient increase in membrane-associated forms of these PKC isoforms. HMBA-resistant MELC fail to display this isoform-specific translocation of PKC. Induction of differentiation is accompanied, over the next 24 h of exposure to HMBA, by a progressive fall in cellular PKC activity, associated with a progressive fall in the cellular content of PKC delta, PKC epsilon, and PKC zeta.

Both DFMO-resistant cell lines exhibited elevated ODC expression due to gene amplification. Moreover, the K562-DFMOr cells, but not the V79-DFMOr cells, had an elevated level of ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 (R2) mRNA and an increased R2 gene copy number. By analysis of their electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, an increased level of the R2 protein was observed in the K562-DFMOr cells as compared to the wild type K562 cells. This is the first description of a DFMO-induced mutant cell line exhibiting coamplification of the genes for ODC and R2, and overexpression of their products. There was no coamplification of the N-myc protooncogene, which is located close to the ODC and R2 genes on human chromosome 2. The alterations exhibited by the K562-DFMOr cell line were shown to be stable for many passages and to convey resistance not only to DFMO but also to hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and thus DNA replication. In the absence of the selective pressure exerted by DFMO, the V79-DFMOr cell line produced revertants by loss of ODC gene amplification within three passages. Coamplification of linked genes may turn out to be an important mechanism in the development of cross-resistance and should be considered when designing therapeutic strategies.","['Ask, A', 'Persson, L', 'Rehnholm, A', 'Frostesjo, L', 'Holm, I', 'Heby, O']","['Ask A', 'Persson L', 'Rehnholm A', 'Frostesjo L', 'Holm I', 'Heby O']","['Department of Oncology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Probes', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Gene Amplification/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Nov 1;53(21):5262-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This limitation can be circumvented by measurement of another cell cycle phase-specific cell constituent in addition to DNA content, followed by bivariate analysis of the correlated data. The aim of the present study was to explore the utility of a monoclonal antibody against the G2- and M phase-specific regulatory protein cyclin B for discrimination of cell populations with overlapping DNA content. This analysis, which was based on correlated DNA/cyclin B content measurements by flow cytometry, was applied to human lymphocytic leukemic MOLT-4 cells. The onset of cyclin B synthesis was observed in the last one third of S phase with its maximum accumulation in G2 and M phases; cells in G1 and early- and mid-S phases were negative. Cells arrested in metaphase by vinblastine expressed high levels of this protein, although not as high as in cells arrested in G2 by the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor m-AMSA. Disruption of cytokinesis by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine led to DNA rereplication, cell progression through the chromatin cycle at higher DNA ploidy, and induction of polyploidy. It was possible, utilizing the cyclin B antibody, to discriminate between G2 + M cells with a 2C level of DNA and G1 cells with 4C DNA, as well as to distinguish doublets of G1 cells with a 2C DNA level. Thus, the rate of cell entrance to G1 at the 4C DNA level and the rates of progression through the cycle at both the 2C and 4C DNA levels could be simultaneously estimated. The data indicate that, in the presence of 0.1 microM staurosporine, cytokinesis of all MOLT-4 cells is impaired and the cells enter to and progress through the chromosome cycle at 4C DNA at the same rates as at 2C DNA. This approach can be helpful in the analysis of DNA ploidy and the cell cycle of human tumors when there is an overlap in DNA content values between normal stromal or infiltrating cells and aneuploid tumor cell population and may be the method of choice to investigate the activity of antitumor drugs which impair cytokinesis but do not interfere with progression of cells through the chromatin cycle.","['Gong, J', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Gong J', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclins/analysis/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', '*Ploidies', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Nov 1;53(21):5096-9.,,,,,,['R01 CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using P53U and P53D primers for amplifying a 371-base pair (bp) target fragment spanning exons 7-10 of p53 cDNA, normal-sized PCR products were amplified from 9 cell lines but not from the Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. An additional larger band (504 bp) was observed for the Molt-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Employing P531 and P53D primers which flank a 76-bp p53 cDNA fragment, 76 bp as well as 209 bp products were generated by PCR of Molt-4 cDNA. Direct sequencing of the 504 bp and 209 bp bands confirmed the presence of a 133 bp insertion between exons 9 and 10 in the aberrant transcript. This insertion was homologous to a 130-bp sequence within the wild-type p53 intron 9, except for 2 point mutations and 3 base insertions. Sequencing of P53U/P53D PCR products of Molt-4 genomic DNA revealed an 8 bp deletion just downstream to the 133 bp insertion, creating a novel donor splicing site within intron 9. This site, coupled with an inherent acceptor splicing site just upstream to the 133 bp insertion, suggests that the 133 bp stretch represents an alternative exon. The occurrence of a termination signal within this alternative transcript is predicted to culminate in a truncated p53 translational product. The sequences of the 371 bp PCR products of Molt-4, HT-1080, SiHa, CaSki, HeLa and MRC-5 cell lines corresponded with the wild-type p53 cDNA.

Eight of nine mice inoculated with drug-sensitive CEM cells developed tumors within 5 weeks, but 16 weeks after inoculation with CEM/MTX-3 cells, none of nine mice developed tumors. We were unable to detect dihydrofolate reductase gene overexpression, amplification, or rearrangement in CEM/MTX-3 cells. Instead, the resistance in CEM/MTX-3 cells appeared to be due largely to decreased methotrexate accumulation. Because tumorigenicity could have been related to intracellular folate levels, we cultured CEM and CEM/MTX-3 cells in folate-rich and folate-deprived media. When inoculated in mice, CEM cells cultured in either medium rapidly formed tumors. As before, CEM/MTX-3 cells grown in either medium did not, suggesting that factors other than low folate levels contributed to the inability of CEM/MTX-3 cells to form tumors. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the CEM/MTX-3 karyotype contained a unique and complex translocation marker chromosome that was not observed in the CEM cell line and which involved chromosomal breakpoints at bands 11p14, 22p11, and 22p13. Although biochemical mechanisms are not yet delineated, this remodeled chromosome could be related to the loss of tumorigenicity in CEM/MTX-3 cells.","['Hill, A B', 'Trent, J M', 'Thompson, F H', 'Danks, M K', 'Beck, W T']","['Hill AB', 'Trent JM', 'Thompson FH', 'Danks MK', 'Beck WT']",['Arizona Cancer Center.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(93)90130-E [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(93)90130-e [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1993 Oct 1;70(1):48-55. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(93)90130-e.,['DHFR'],,,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the significance of a chimeric gene expression in the progression of CML, we analyzed 43 patients for bcr-ABL chimeric mRNA expression. Both DNA and RNA analyses revealed a possible influence of breakpoint sites in the bcr region on the duration of the chronic phase. Patients with the breakpoint located at about the 1-kb region between BamHI and HindIII in bcr exon 3 (region C2) had a significantly shorter chronic phase (31 months) (p = 0.028) than patients in whom the breakpoint was located in other regions. When the bcr locus was divided into 5' and 3' regions as for the BamHI cleavage site located near the 5' region of bcr exon 3, the chronic phase duration in patients with the 5' site (HindIII-BamHI) and 3' site (BamHI-EcoRI site) was 75 and 38 months, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.128).

One patient with trisomy 8 showed erythrocytic participation in the leukemic process, but in another the erythrocytic lineage had only normal karyotypes. Thus, in AML, the chromosome abnormalities apparently usually originate at the multipotent progenitor cell stage, since in addition to granulocytic/monocytic lineages, erythrocytic and/or megakaryocytic lineages were also involved.

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering-New York-II protocol.,3120-30,"BACKGROUND: Improved survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has made it more difficult to develop new protocols to further improve results. The authors report the pilot experience with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering-New York-II (MSK-NY-II) protocol, based on the New York regimen with changes made in an attempt to improve efficacy while reducing toxicity. METHODS: Forty-four of 46 consecutive patients were randomized to one of four regimens varying only in the sequence and mode of administration of the drugs during the first 48 hours of therapy, while the kinetics of the disappearance of the leukemic cells from the bone marrow was monitored with bone marrow aspirates and biopsies on days 0, 2, 7, and 14. RESULTS: Thirty-two high-risk and 12 average-risk patients were randomized. The marrow contained less than 25% blasts in 74.4% and 92.9% by day 7 and 14, respectively. Ninety-three percent achieved remission. Regimens beginning with daunorubicin achieved a greater and more rapid reduction in leukemic cells than those starting with cyclophosphamide. Daunorubicin infusion produced a more rapid cytoreduction than daunorubicin bolus. Two of 41 patients who achieved remission relapsed, and there was one death in remission. With a median follow-up of 54+ months, the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 86% +/- 10%. Disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 48 months was 93%. The estimated 4-year EFS rate for the high-risk and average-risk patients were 83 +/- 14% and 93 +/- 10%, respectively. Four of 18 patients given daunorubicin bolus and 0 of 18 patients given daunorubicin infusion who were monitored with serial echocardiograms had significant decrease in cardiac function (P = 0.10). The major toxicity of the therapy was infections, with 35% of patients developing serious infections during induction and consolidation. Half the patients had an episode of bacteremia from the venous catheter during the 2 years of maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: Close monitoring of kinetics of cytoreduction can rapidly distinguish between similar therapies, and the surrogate end-point may reduce the need for the long follow-up periods that may still be required to demonstrate differences in EFS. Continuous infusion of daunorubicin had less cardiotoxicity with faster antileukemic activity than bolus infusion. The MSK-NY-II protocol with a 86% 4-year EFS rate and a 95% DFS rate was a promising new regimen for the treatment of average-risk and high-risk ALL.","['Steinherz, P G', 'Redner, A', 'Steinherz, L', 'Meyers, P', 'Tan, C', 'Heller, G']","['Steinherz PG', 'Redner A', 'Steinherz L', 'Meyers P', 'Tan C', 'Heller G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931115)72:10<3120::aid-cncr2820721038>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Nov 15;72(10):3120-30. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931115)72:10<3120::aid-cncr2820721038>3.0.co;2-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these proto-oncogenes are expressed postmeiotically, especially in the round spermatid stage. Recently, we demonstrated the presence of c-myc protein in mature ejaculated sperm cells with a possible role in sperm cell function. Since the half-life of c-myc protein has been shown to be short, we suspected the presence of c-myc mRNA in human sperm cells. In the present study, the presence of the c-myc mRNA transcript in human sperm cells was investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and in situ hybridization. Total RNA, 5-10 micrograms, was extracted from 0.2-0.5 ml of pelleted human sperm cells by NP-40 lysis procedure, and was used to construct cDNA with pd(N)6 random primer and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase. The PCR with sperm cDNA and primers #P1 and #P2, both from exon 3, resulted in amplification of the expected 322 bp product. Primers #P3 and #P4, which are located in exon 2 and exon 3, respectively, and are 1.37 kb apart, gave the expected PCR amplified 313 bp product ruling out the possibility of DNA contamination. The presence of c-myc mRNA in human sperm cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin labelled DNA probe, containing exon 2 of the c-myc gene sequence.

Assay conditions were first defined so that fluorescence intensity of the PCR products was linear with respect to input RNA and exponential relative to PCR cycle number. Sensitivity and reproducibility of detection were evaluated with serial dilutions of RT PCR reactions. We have applied this assay to an analysis of the lineage-specific expression of two human Fc gamma RIIA transcripts, Fc gamma RIIa1 and Fc gamma RIIa2, in different hematopoietic cell lines. Previously, we noted that when standard RT PCR conditions are used with primers that bracket the TM exon, the pattern of expression of these transcripts as assessed by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels varied in different hematopoietic cell lineages. Using the fluorescence-based RT PCR method, we now confirm our previous findings and quantitate transcript ratios (Fc gamma RIIa2/Fc gamma RIIa1) in several hematopoietic cell lines. The ratio varies from 0.70 (41% Fc gamma RIIa2) in the erythroleukemic cell line HEL, to 0.14 (12% Fc gamma RIIa2) in the monocytic cell line U937, to 0.07 (6% Fc gamma RIIa2) in the multipotential cell line K562.

This aberrant sialylation of CML granulocytes contributes to the decreased binding of the synthetic chemotactic peptide, formyl Met Leu Phe (fMLP), to the surface of CML granulocytes which leads to a rapid, transient increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i), an integral step in the biochemical cascade leading to cell activation. To determine if the decrease in binding of fMLP to CML granulocytes translates into a functional deficit, we measured fMLP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Compared to normal granulocytes, fMLP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were markedly decreased in CML granulocytes. After sialidase treatment, a significant augmentation in fMLP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i was noted in CML granulocytes, indicating that the decreased signalling may be a consequence of aberrant sialylation. To determine if the effects of aberrant sialylation also alters the binding of endogenous polypeptide mediators, we determined the effect of desialylation of CML and normal granulocytes on binding of the colony stimulating factor for granulocytes and monocytes (GM-CSF), which plays a role in differentiation and proliferation of myeloid-lineage cells. As with fMLP binding, we also showed that the binding of GM-CSF to CML granulocytes, but not normal granulocytes, was markedly increased after sialidase treatment. Similarly, binding of GM-CSF to undifferentiated HL-60 cells was markedly increased after sialidase treatment. Therefore, we have demonstrated that aberrant sialylation of CML granulocytes not only alters the binding of fMLP and GM-CSF to their receptor(s), but may also alter signal transduction. Thus, aberrant glycosylation of CML granulocytes may reduce the binding of hematopoietic growth factors, which in turn may be responsible for the immature phenotype of CML granulocytes.","['Cyopick, P', 'Culliton, R', 'Brockhausen, I', 'Sutherland, D R', 'Mills, G B', 'Baker, M']","['Cyopick P', 'Culliton R', 'Brockhausen I', 'Sutherland DR', 'Mills GB', 'Baker M']","['Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Sialic Acids)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309054733 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Sep;11(1-2):79-90. doi: 10.3109/10428199309054733.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-seven of 50 patients assigned to intermediate-dose cytarabine achieved remission (74%) and the actuarial disease-free and overall survival after achieving remission were 26 +/- 16% and 39 +/- 18% respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in complete remission rate, actuarial leukemia-free survival or overall survival between the groups. The most significant predictor for survival was age. Actuarial two year leukemia-free survival and overall survival for patients age > 60 were 8 +/- 15% and 20 +/- 19% respectively compared to 36 +/- 14% and 54 +/- 15% for patients age < or = 60 (P = .058 and .01, respectively). Induction regimen did not significantly affect disease free or overall survival for patients under or over age 60. We conclude that intermediate-dose cytarabine did not substantially improve results of induction for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.","['Schiller, G', 'Nimer, S', 'Gajewski, J', 'Lee, M', 'Ho, W', 'Territo, M', 'Champlin, R']","['Schiller G', 'Nimer S', 'Gajewski J', 'Lee M', 'Ho W', 'Territo M', 'Champlin R']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309054732 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Sep;11(1-2):69-77. doi: 10.3109/10428199309054732.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients had AHA before therapy; only one achieved remission of both CLL and AHA after fludarabine alone. In the other seven patients, we observed no effect or even a worsening of AHA, although the CLL was responding to fludarabine. Five patients developed AHA from 1 to 19 months after fludarabine therapy while the CLL was responding. One additional patient developed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) 3 months after starting therapy.

International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH).,37-50,"The classification of acute leukaemias is now widely based on a combined morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotyping approach. Difficulties are frequently encountered however in reaching an acceptable degree of diagnostic concordance between different laboratories because of variations in the techniques used (in terms of methodologies, reagents and equipment) and diagnostic interpretation. The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) convened an expert panel to consider currently available diagnostic techniques with the aim of defining a minimum cytochemical and immunological diagnostic panel that could be used as core components for the classification of acute leukemia. The proposed ICSH scheme, which attempts to balance the basic requirement for providing precise and informative diagnostic information without limiting its use to only those laboratories with sophisticated facilities, is based on three sequential levels of investigation; primary cytochemistry, intracellular phenotyping and membrane immunophenotyping. The minimum ICSH recommended cytochemistries comprise myeloperoxidase (MPO), chloroacetate esterase (ChlorE) and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), and standardised methods for these cytochemistries are detailed in this communication. For cases of acute leukaemia that remain unclassified by primary cytochemistry, subsequent immunological analyses for cytoplasmic CD3, CD22, MPO and nuclear TdT are recommended. The ICSH panel considers that the use of these minimum primary cytochemical and intracellular phenotyping procedures will lead to the consistent classification of most acute leukaemias, and that the third level of investigation (membrane immunophenotyping) should be used for the purposes of confirmation, diagnostic clarification of atypical leukaemias, and the subtyping of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). The ICSH panel also recognised that there are a number of additional technologies which can provide definitive diagnostic information, such as cytogenetics and DNA genotyping, but these were excluded from the minimum panel because of their restricted availability. While many specialised laboratories, particularly in the areas of diagnostic research, will continue to use individual investigatory protocols, it is considered that the inclusion of the ICSH scheme as core components would lead to greater consistency when comparing independent studies of acute leukemia.","['Scott, C S', 'Den Ottolander, G J', 'Swirsky, D', 'Pangalis, G A', 'Vives Corrons, J L', 'de Pasquale, A', 'van Hove, L', 'Bennett, J M', 'Namba, K', 'Flandrin, G']","['Scott CS', 'Den Ottolander GJ', 'Swirsky D', 'Pangalis GA', 'Vives Corrons JL', 'de Pasquale A', 'van Hove L', 'Bennett JM', 'Namba K', 'Flandrin G', 'et al.']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds General Infirmary, England, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*classification/enzymology/immunology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309054729 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Sep;11(1-2):37-50. doi: 10.3109/10428199309054729.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This propensity has been attributed to the release of tissue factor (TF)-like procoagulants from the leukemic cells leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, recent data suggest that the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy is more complicated and may involve activation of the generalized proteolytic cascade resulting in either clotting and/or excessive fibrinolysis. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding the mechanism(s) responsible for the activation of either clotting or fibrinolysis. The malignant promyelocyte may act directly to activate coagulation and/or fibrinolysis. Alternatively, reactive inflammatory cells, which express procoagulant and/or profibrinolytic activities may play an essential role. A third possibility may involve endothelial cell expression of mediators with procoagulant/profibrinolytic properties. Putative profibrinolytic mechanisms include the release of urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activators, decreases in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and 2, and decreases in alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor. Putative procoagulant mechanisms include the release of tissue factor, Cancer Procoagulant, or cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and vascular permeability factor. Putative anticoagulant mediators include annexins, a group of proteins in human tissue which bind phospholipids and have anticoagulant activity, which have been reported in patients with APL. The current treatment of APL is rapidly evolving because of the efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). All-trans retinoic acid promotes terminal differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes leading to complete remission in the majority of patients with APL with rapid resolution of the coagulopathy. Although the mechanism by which this occurs has not been established, preliminary data suggest that ATRA blocks the downregulation of the thrombomodulin gene and the up-regulation of the tissue factor gene induced by tumor necrosis factor. Since APL is a relatively uncommon disorder, the collaboration of cooperative oncology groups will be important to study patients receiving ATRA or conventional chemotherapy to further elucidate the mechanism(s) of the coagulopathy.","['Tallman, M S', 'Hakimian, D', 'Kwaan, H C', 'Rickles, F R']","['Tallman MS', 'Hakimian D', 'Kwaan HC', 'Rickles FR']","['Northwestern University Medical School, Robert H.

We found that ALL cell populations consist of both a subpopulation of progenitors with the immunophenotype of normal B-cell precursors that has self-renewal capability and a second subpopulation with a more mature early B-cell immunophenotype that is without self-renewal capability but can proliferate to a limited extent. In our recent studies we were able to grow the progenitor cells in the ALL blast colony assay and establish their leukemic origin using the polymerase chain reaction. Our results suggest that these progenitors are the cells that sustain the disease. We hypothesize that these cells may remain quiescent, for a time, and either eventually die or regain proliferative capability and cause relapse. Further studies aimed both at detecting residual ALL and determining changes in their biology may provide an understanding of the mechanisms of relapse in this disease.","['Estrov, Z', 'Re, G G', 'Zipf, T F']","['Estrov Z', 'Re GG', 'Zipf TF']","['Division of Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology/therapy']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309054724 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Sep;11(1-2):1-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199309054724.,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,

A correct diagnosis in these cases is often difficult, and these are more commonly misdiagnosed as large cell lymphoma. We describe two women, 40 and 89 years of age respectively, in whom a myelosarcoma involving the neck lymph nodes was diagnosed by cytological examination of a fine needle aspiration biopsy, one and 10 weeks before the onset of acute myelogenous leukemia. The fine needle aspiration technique allowed a quick and unexpected diagnosis to be made demonstrating granulocytic differentiation and the presence of myelo-monocytic cells within lymphatic tissue. The simplicity of the procedure, coupled with its reliability and rapidity suggest that fine needle aspiration biopsies should be used more widely as a first choice method in the diagnostic evaluation of palpable lymph nodes.","['Bizzaro, N', 'Briani, G']","['Bizzaro N', 'Briani G']","['Laboratorio di Patologia Clinica e Servizio di Anatomia Patologica, Ospedale Civile, S.

However, data from morphological evaluation, immunophenotyping, bcr-abl gene rearrangement analysis, DNA fingerprinting, Northern blot analysis of globin gene expression and esterase isoenzyme analysis clearly established that the three cell lines are related. Cytogenetic examination while not proving the common identity of the cells provided further evidence for the suspected common origin of all three cell lines. Chromosome banding, DNA fingerprinting and bcr-abl genotyping suggested further evolution of these clones during long-term cultivation.

There was no statistical difference between the patients who survived and those who died in relation to the mean time of onset of IA or the total and mean daily dose of amphotericin B. On the other hand a favourable outcome correlated strongly with complete leukemic remission (p < 0.0001): all but one of the patients with objective residual leukemia died of IA, whereas all those who achieved complete hematological remission survived. In conclusion, it seems that the main vital prognostic factor in these leukemic patients with IA was the achievement of complete remission.

Median treatment-free survival correlated with the hematologic response postsplenectomy and the underlying diagnosis. Better treatment-free survivals were seen in patients with lesser degrees of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Overall, improvements were more pronounced in the B-cell than in the T-cell disorders. Indications for further therapy, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and survival times are discussed along with a review of the literature. These findings advocate a continuing role for splenectomy in symptomatic lymphoid malignancies running with splenomegaly and hypersplenism.","['Coad, J E', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Coad JE', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Hematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/classification/mortality/surgery/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/surgery', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148547 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Jul;10(4-5):245-64. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148547.,,,,,115,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the incidence of infectious episodes during therapy correlated with severity of neutropenia, stage of disease, and response to therapy, an effort was made to reduce therapy-related myelosuppression and improve response by altering the conventional therapy regimen. The protocol which yielded a response rate of 57% in previously treated patients with CLL consisted of five consecutive daily doses of 25-30 mg/m2 fludarabine given every three to four weeks. Based on observations from intracellular pharmacology studies it was hypothesized that repetitive single weekly doses of fludarabine would allow normal bone marrow cells to recover while maintaining cytotoxic levels in the leukemic cells. The cumulative four-week dose of the once-weekly regimen was approximately 80% of the original protocol. Eleven out of 46 evaluable patients (24%) responded to the therapy. Seven patients (15%) achieved a complete remission, and four (9%) a partial remission. While myelosuppression was reduced by about 30% compared with the original protocol, the incidence of febrile episodes was increased by 17%. Pretreatment serum IgG levels below the normal range correlated significantly with a high incidence of infectious episodes and with a short median survival time. These observations suggest that in addition to myelosuppressive therapy, disease related depressed immune function causes morbidity and mortality due to infections. The results further show that changes in the scheduling of the therapy regimen, associated with a slightly lower dose, resulted in reduced efficacy as measured by the response rate.","['Kemena, A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Robertson, L', 'Koller, C', 'Beran, M', 'Estey, E', 'Plunkett, W', 'Lerner, S', 'Keating, M J']","['Kemena A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Robertson L', 'Koller C', 'Beran M', 'Estey E', 'Plunkett W', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309145882 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Jun;10(3):187-93. doi: 10.3109/10428199309145882.,,,,,,['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The cases were stratified by French-American-British morphology in order to evaluate potential differences in risk based on this classification system. There was little evidence of any association between cigarette smoking by parents during the index pregnancy and childhood AML. There was some evidence of an increased risk of AML among children who were diagnosed at or before 2 years of age and whose mothers reported consuming alcohol during their pregnancies (odds ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 8.35). This finding appeared to be especially pronounced for AML with a monocytic component (M4/M5) (odds ratio, 9.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 394.5), but a cautious interpretation of these data are advised because of the small number of subjects included in this subgroup analysis. Since this is one of the first case-control studies to evaluate specific French-American-British subtypes of AML, these results may be viewed as generating hypotheses. It is suggested that future studies of childhood AML include: (a) a sufficient number of cases to permit an evaluation of the morphological classification of the cases; and (b) additional questions on the alcohol consumption of the mother during the time of her pregnancy with the index child.","['Severson, R K', 'Buckley, J D', 'Woods, W G', 'Benjamin, D', 'Robison, L L']","['Severson RK', 'Buckley JD', 'Woods WG', 'Benjamin D', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Epidemiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55454.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['3K9958V90M (Ethanol)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology', 'Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethanol/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Parents', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*epidemiology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1993 Sep-Oct;2(5):433-9.,,,,,,['CA35314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have attempted to quantify changes occurring in cellular c-myc protein content in response to growth-inhibitory conditions, or to relate such changes to total cellular protein (TCP) levels, %S phase cells and/or cellular growth balance. Knowledge of such relationships is important for determining the biological relevance of the c-myc protein as a marker for proliferating cells. In this study, a dual-laser flow cytometric technique employing three fluorescent dyes was used to quantify cellular changes in c-myc protein, TCP, DNA and growth balance in exponentially-growing and serum deprived U118MG, A-172 and HL-60 cells. Results obtained by flow cytometry were verified using other techniques. Changes in c-myc protein content were found to occur independently of changes in TCP, %S phase or cellular growth balance, and varied between cell lines. These results indicate that cellular c-myc protein determinations convey information that is unique from other indicators of cellular growth and proliferation.

Activation can be mimicked in the PEER T-cell leukemia cell line by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and N6-2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (bt2cAMP). In this report, we show that a consensus AP-1 element and a consensus cAMP response element (CRE) located 5' to the CSP-B transcriptional start site are both required for transcriptional activation of the CPS-B promoter in TPA + bt2cAMP-stimulated PEER cells. A 94-bp fragment containing both elements activates a heterologous promoter in an orientation-independent fashion. Several single nucleotide substitutions in the AP-1 site abolish activity of the 94-bp fragment. Several point mutations in the consensus CRE substantially reduce promoter activity, but one CRE mutation increases activity fourfold. Replacement of the CRE with a second copy of the AP-1 site results in a level of transcriptional activity comparable with that of the wild-type sequence, but replacement of the AP-1 site with a CRE abolishes activity. Neither the AP-1 site nor the CRE can be effectively replaced with an SP-1 site. Deletions between the AP-1 site and the CRE retain full activity only if helical spacing is preserved, suggesting that synergism between these two elements is either the result of cooperative binding of factors to the DNA or of cooperative binding of DNA-bound factors to another protein.","['Hanson, R D', 'Grisolano, J L', 'Ley, T J']","['Hanson RD', 'Grisolano JL', 'Ley TJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Jewish Hospital, Washington University Medical Center, St Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Genes, jun', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81923-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 1;82(9):2749-57.,,,,,,"['P01 CA 49712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK 38682/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We studied viral production and its relation to TNF in a HL-60 cell line (J22-HL-60) infected with a monocytotropic strain of HIV-1JR-FL. Viral production was stimulated to similar levels by TNF, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3). Production of the virus was not suppressed by 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), indicating that viral production was not caused by superinfection. Low concentrations of TNF (0.1 ng/mL) induced viral production with a short lag period of 8 hours, and this proviral activation was specifically suppressed by anti-TNF antibodies. However, induction of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3 showed an extended lag period of 2 to 3 days. The effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on virus production was also blocked by anti-TNF antibodies, which suggests the direct participation of TNF in this process. TNF accumulated in the culture supernatant of cells stimulated with 1,25(OH)2D3 with a kinetics consistent with its involvement in the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 on viral production. The J22-HL-60 cell line produced low levels of virus when cultured in the absence of an external stimulus; however, this basal viral production was suppressed greater than 80% in the presence of anti-TNF antibodies. Corresponding low levels of TNF were detected in the culture supernatants. Viral production decreased slowly with increasing passage of the cells, and no virus was detected in the supernatants of cells maintained in culture for several months. Concomitantly, TNF was no longer detected in the supernatant of these cells, which suggests that endogenous autocrine production of TNF drives viral production in the unstimulated cells. However, viral production was stimulated in these cells by low concentrations (0.1 ng/mL) of added TNF.

We have recently shown that IL-6 induces the expression of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) in these cells. In the present study we investigate the mechanism of action of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), an antagonist of IL-4 in numerous cells and a cofactor in both induction and suppression of myelopoiesis, on the expression of IL-4R. Flow cytometry shows that IFN-gamma downregulates the IL-6-induced expression of IL-4R whereas it has no such effect on the high-affinity receptors for monomeric IgG2a (Fc gamma RI). As demonstrated by Scatchard analysis, the number of IL-4R decreases by more than 50% after IFN-gamma treatment whereas the receptor affinity remains unchanged. Northern analysis shows that this decrease is paralleled by a decrease in IL-4R mRNA but not Fc gamma RI or lysozyme mRNA. Nuclear run-on analysis shows that IFN-gamma suppresses the IL-6-induced transcription of the IL-4R gene, whereas actinomycin-D chase experiments showed no change of IL-4R mRNA stability. Furthermore, the production of soluble IL-4R protein is suppressed by IFN-gamma as well. These data explain how IL-4R can be modulated by IFN-gamma in myeloid cells and are consistent with the myelosuppressive capacity of IFN-gamma.","['Ruhl, S', 'Feldman, G M', 'Akahane, K', 'Pluznik, D H']","['Ruhl S', 'Feldman GM', 'Akahane K', 'Pluznik DH']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muramidase/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81912-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 1;82(9):2641-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the MDM-2 gene in cells increases their tumorigenic potential and overcomes the growth-suppressive activity of p53. Previous reports have shown that the MDM-2 gene is amplified in approximately one third of human sarcomas. To examine the role of MDM-2 in leukemia, we analyzed MDM-2 gene amplification and mRNA expression in various types of leukemias. We did not detect gene amplification in any of the 48 cases of leukemia that we examined. In contrast, we observed significant MDM-2 mRNA overexpression in 34 of 64 cases (53%). The level of mRNA overexpression in some cases of leukemias was comparable to that observed in some cases of sarcomas, which demonstrate more than 50-fold MDM-2 gene amplification. Furthermore, we divided these cases into different prognostic groups according to their karyotypic abnormalities. MDM-2 overexpression seemed to be associated with unfavorable chromosomal abnormalities. These findings suggest that the expression of the MDM-2 gene is altered in a significant fraction of human leukemias and MDM-2 may play a significant role in leukemogenesis. In addition, these results suggest that mechanisms other than gene amplification may play a significant role in deregulating the MDM-2 expression.","['Bueso-Ramos, C E', 'Yang, Y', 'deLeon, E', 'McCown, P', 'Stass, S A', 'Albitar, M']","['Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Yang Y', 'deLeon E', 'McCown P', 'Stass SA', 'Albitar M']","['Hematopathology Program, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030-4095.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81909-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 1;82(9):2617-23.,['MDM-2'],,,,,"['HL-02229/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR5511/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recently IRF1, a putative tumor suppressor gene localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, has been shown to be deleted from the 5q- chromosome in a group of patients with MDS and AML. It has been suggested that the loss of IRF1 may be critical to the development of the 5q- syndrome. We have investigated the allelic loss of IRF1 in a group of 12 patients with MDS and a 5q deletion and 2 patients with AML and a 5q deletion. Gene dosage experiments demonstrated that 12 of 14 patients had loss of one allele of the IRF1 gene but no evidence of homozygous loss and that 2 patients with 5q- syndrome retained both copies of the gene. The retention of IRF1 on the 5q- chromosome in these two cases has been confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization localization using an IRF1 cosmid. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to determine whether there was any evidence for structural rearrangement in the region encompassing the IRF1 gene in these two patients. No aberrant bands were detected with a range of rare cutter enzyme digests. We conclude that IRF1 maps outside the commonly deleted segment of the 5q- chromosome and that loss of IRF1 is not solely responsible for the development of the 5q- syndrome.","['Boultwood, J', 'Fidler, C', 'Lewis, S', 'MacCarthy, A', 'Sheridan, H', 'Kelly, S', 'Oscier, D', 'Buckle, V J', 'Wainscoat, J S']","['Boultwood J', 'Fidler C', 'Lewis S', 'MacCarthy A', 'Sheridan H', 'Kelly S', 'Oscier D', 'Buckle VJ', 'Wainscoat JS']","['Department of Haematology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81908-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 1;82(9):2611-6.,['IRF1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples with abnormal SSCP were reamplified and analyzed by direct sequencing method. p53 mutations were detected within the known mutational hotspots (exons 5 to 8) in 8 of 330 lymphoid malignancies, and in none of 29 myeloid malignancies, showing that the frequency of p53 mutations in childhood lymphoid malignancies was very low (8 of 330 cases [2%]). Four of these patients had very aggressive, fatal acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). None of 13 infants and none of 48 patients with T-lineage leukemia had detectable p53 mutations in their ALL cells. Exceptionally, p53 mutations were comparatively frequent in a small sample of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (2 of 8 cases). Mutations were detected in samples from two patients with ALL at relapse; these were not detected in samples at initial diagnosis from the same patients, suggesting that p53 mutations may be associated with progression to a more malignant phenotype.

Mitoxantrone-mediated PCD was associated with a steep inhibition of the clonogenic survival of the leukemic cells.

A major dose reduction of r alpha 2bIFN (> or = 50%) was required at some time during treatment in 38% of patients, 26% required 10% to 49% dose reductions, and 36% had minor dose reductions of < or = 10%. No association was observed between dose received and the attainment of a cytogenetic response. None of the usual prognostic factors (sex, race, performance status, weight loss, time from diagnosis to treatment, hepatosplenomegaly, age, symptoms, hemoglobin, or platelet, blast, basophil, or white blood cell count) were significantly related to survival. These data provide confirmation that major cytogenetic responses to prolonged administration of subcutaneous r alpha 2bIFN occur in 20% to 38% (95% confidence interval) of chronic-phase Ph-positive patients. Although it is hypothesized that patients achieving major cytogenetic responses to r alpha 2bIFN should have prolonged remission duration and survival compared with nonresponders, analyses of the effect of cytogenetic responders by both ""landmark"" and time-dependent covariate techniques fail to provide statistically significant evidence for an effect of cytogenetic response on remission duration or survival. This may be due in part to an effect size insufficiently large to be detected with the number of patients treated in this study. Thus, confirmation of remission duration or survival benefit, if any, of r alpha 2bIFN therapy in Ph-positive chronic-phase CML must await the outcome of randomized trials comparing IFN with conventional agents.","['Ozer, H', 'George, S L', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Rao, K', 'Rao, P N', 'Wurster-Hill, D H', 'Arthur, D D', 'Powell, B', 'Gottlieb, A', 'Peterson, B A', 'Rai, K', 'Testa, J R', 'LeBeau, M', 'Tantravahi, R', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Ozer H', 'George SL', 'Schiffer CA', 'Rao K', 'Rao PN', 'Wurster-Hill DH', 'Arthur DD', 'Powell B', 'Gottlieb A', 'Peterson BA', 'Rai K', 'Testa JR', 'LeBeau M', 'Tantravahi R', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79460-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):2975-84.,,,"['Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3592-4.

To test this hypothesis, we performed a dose-escalating 3-month-trial of ATRA in 15 patients with primary or secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Morphologic diagnoses were refractory anemia (RA) in 4, RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS) in 2, RA with excess blasts (RAEB) in 7, and RAEB in transformation (RAEB/T) in 2 cases. Patients included were required to have one or more of the following criteria: transfusion-dependent anemia, pronounced neutropenia (< or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L) or thrombocytopenia (< or = 20 x 10(9)/L), or increasing blast cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Therapy was started at an ATRA dose of 30 mg/m2/d, administered orally as two doses of 15 mg/m2 every 12 hours. The retinoid dose was increased to 60 mg/m2/d after 4 weeks and to 90 mg/m2/d after 8 weeks. Among 14 patients assessable for response, none obtained a complete or partial remission. Three patients had a minor response, manifested by either reduction in transfusion requirements (2 patients) or increase in neutrophil and platelet counts (1 patient). During the study period, 5 patients progressed to more advanced stages of MDS or overt leukemia. Three patients with chromosomal abnormalities receiving ATRA for a period of 10 to 12 weeks retained their cytogenetic marker after completion of treatment. Side effects of ATRA primarily affected the skin and mucous membranes, with 13 of 15 patients having at least low-grade dermatologic toxicity. In 2 cases, treatment had to be prematurely stopped because of intolerable conjunctivitis or progressive neurologic symptoms. These data suggest that ATRA has little effect on MDS. The lack of response of MDS patients, as compared with those with APL, may be attributed to the absence of the t(15;17) translocation that seems to be a prerequisite for clinical efficacy of ATRA.","['Aul, C', 'Runde, V', 'Gattermann, N']","['Aul C', 'Runde V', 'Gattermann N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79459-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):2967-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we reexamined this phenomenon with both B-CLL and T-CLL cells, using a serum-free culture system. After 48 h of culture, in B-CLL cells, 23.3% +/- 6.7% (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 3) of total DNA was fragmented, while in 2 cases of T-CLL, this value was 32% and 45%, respectively. Analysis by electrophoresis indicated that the DNA of the B-CLL and T-CLL cells had been cleaved into regular oligonucleosome fragments comprising approximately 180-200 base pairs. This process was significantly promoted by methylprednisolone and the protein kinase A (PKA) activator Sp-cAMPS in at least some cases. Since B-CLL and T-CLL cells often possess interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors on their cell membranes, we assessed the effects of IL-2 on spontaneous PCD. After a 48-h culture PCD was inhibited by 100 units/ml IL-2 by 31.7% +/- 6.6% in B-CLL (n = 3) and by 47% in one of 2 cases of T-CLL. This protective effect of IL-2 against spontaneous PCD was dose- and time-dependent. These findings suggest that the viability of B-CLL and T-CLL cells in vivo is regulated both positively and negatively by intrinsic IL-2, glucocorticoids, and regulators of PKA activity. This process of cell death may be involved in the development of CLL.","['Huang, R W', 'Tsuda, H', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Huang RW', 'Tsuda H', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Aug;58(1-2):83-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Okadaic acid alone did not induce any differentiation. The process of D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation on cultivation in magnesium deficient medium can be divided into two steps namely commitment and phenotypic expression as we have previously reported (J Cell Physiol 1987;131:50; Cell Growth Diff 1991;2:415), and the effect of okadaic acid on each step was studied. The results obtained indicated that okadaic acid inhibited commitment and enhanced phenotypic expression. We have previously shown that PKC has a dual action in the process of differentiation, i.e. as a positive regulatory signal in commitment and as a negative one in phenotypic expression. Thus, although okadaic acid has been reported to enhance the phosphorylation of various proteins that are also phosphorylated by PKC, we found that it mimics the role of PKC inhibitors such as H7 and staurosporine in D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Okuda, T', 'Tashima, M', 'Tohi, T', 'Ogawa, K', 'Sawada, H', 'Okuma, M']","['Okuda T', 'Tashima M', 'Tohi T', 'Ogawa K', 'Sawada H', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Aug;58(1-2):37-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-BP inactivates TNF by formation of high affinity complexes thereby reducing the binding of TNF to target cell membrane receptors. In addition, TNF is stabilized in complex with TNF-BP, and under certain conditions the complex may act as a slow releaser of biologically active TNF. TNF can induce the release of TNF-BP in vivo which might neutralize the bioactivity of TNF. Cytokine control by natural and recombinant cytokine inhibitors such as TNF-BP could be a promising therapeutic approach in chronic inflammatory disorders to shift the balance between a cytokine-induced response and counteracting ""anticytokines"". A local production of TNF-BP in some tumour tissues may inactivate TNF for the benefit of the tumour. In some leukemias e.g. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where TNF can act as a growth factor for the malignant cells, TNF-BP may be growth inhibitory.","['Olsson, I', 'Gatanaga, T', 'Gullberg, U', 'Lantz, M', 'Granger, G A']","['Olsson I', 'Gatanaga T', 'Gullberg U', 'Lantz M', 'Granger GA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)']",IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Solubility']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1993 May-Jun;4(3):169-80.,,,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding sites were specific for MCAF since other polypeptide cytokines and the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) failed to compete for 125I-rhMCAF binding. Steady-state binding experiments at 4 degrees C revealed the presence of 13,000 and 18,000 receptor sites/cell on monocytes and THP-1 cells with Kd values of 22.5 nM and 25.7 nM, respectively. Compared to a human natural MCAF, rhMCAF was less potent in inducing maximal monocyte migration. Human natural MCAF similarly competed more efficiently for 125I-rhMCAF binding than unlabelled rhMCAF. The ligand-receptor association was highly temperature-dependent, with maximal ligand uptake at 37 degrees C accompanied by internalization of the ligand-receptor complexes. The internalized 125I-MCAF was progressively degraded and released into the culture medium starting at 30 min. Lysosomotropic ammonium chloride could inhibit the degradation of this ligand suggesting the involvement of lysosomal enzymes in the proteolytic digestion. Incubation with cycloheximide did not block the rapid reappearance of MCAF receptors within 20 min on the cell surface indicative of receptor recycling rather than new protein synthesis. These data indicate that monocytic cells express specific receptors for rhMCAF which can be dynamically regulated by MCAF.","['Wang, J M', 'Hishinuma, A', 'Oppenheim, J J', 'Matsushima, K']","['Wang JM', 'Hishinuma A', 'Oppenheim JJ', 'Matsushima K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, CCR2)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemotactic Factors/*metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR2', '*Receptors, Chemokine', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(93)90014-V [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(93)90014-v [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1993 May;5(3):264-75. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(93)90014-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study revealed that TGF-beta 1 enhanced the Fc gamma RI- and Fc gamma RII-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of the cells differentiated in the presence of VD3 and RA. However, production of active oxygen molecules was suppressed by TGF-beta 1. On the other hand, IL-6 stimulated production of active oxygen molecules and ADCC of the cells treated with VD3 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Furthermore, the levels of cell surface Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII were not clearly correlated with the ADCC. The TGF-beta 1/VD3-treated HL-60 cells were able to synthesize mRNAs for TGF-beta 1 and TNF-alpha, although TNF-alpha protein was not detectable. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 has a bifunctional role, either stimulatory or inhibitory, in the modulation of macrophage activities through Fc gamma Rs and that IL-6 stimulates certain macrophage activities in mature cells.","['Morikawa, M', 'Harada, N', 'Nunomura, Y', 'Koike, T', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Soma, G', 'Yoshida, T']","['Morikawa M', 'Harada N', 'Nunomura Y', 'Koike T', 'Hashimoto S', 'Soma G', 'Yoshida T']","['Tokyo Institute for Immunopharmacology, Inc., Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(93)90013-U [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(93)90013-u [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1993 May;5(3):255-63. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(93)90013-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the flow cytometer, the hydrodynamically focused cells and cell pairs are first optically analyzed in a normal flow channel and then forced to flow through a Coulter orifice. If the optical analysis indicates that a cell pair is present, an electric pulse is applied across the orifice to induce fusion. The pulsed cell pairs were subsequently analyzed using normal and confocal microscopy to evaluate fusion induction. It appears that fusion can be induced in about 10% of pulsed cell pairs when one electric pulse with a duration of 10-15 microseconds and an effective electric field strength of 4-8 10(5) V/m is used.","['Bakker Schut, T C', 'Kraan, Y M', 'Barlag, W', 'de Leij, L', 'de Grooth, B G', 'Greve, J']","['Bakker Schut TC', 'Kraan YM', 'Barlag W', 'de Leij L', 'de Grooth BG', 'Greve J']","['Department of Applied Physics, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Fusion', 'Electric Stimulation/instrumentation/methods', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(93)81128-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81128-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1993 Aug;65(2):568-72. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81128-7.,,,,PMC1225759,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We based the exposure assessment on measurements from 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job held longest during the 10-year period before diagnosis, we found an association between the average, daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI = 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2); 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested. Tasks with frequent or large variations between high and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a prolonged high level (high median values) showed the strongest association. Confounding by place of residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation, pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on the associations. We also analyzed other potential sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an excess number of low-exposure subjects among non-responders, which, to some extent, may have enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained. Our conclusion is that the study supports the hypothesis that occupational EMF exposure is a hazard in the development of certain cancers.","['Floderus, B', 'Persson, T', 'Stenlund, C', 'Wennberg, A', 'Ost, A', 'Knave, B']","['Floderus B', 'Persson T', 'Stenlund C', 'Wennberg A', 'Ost A', 'Knave B']","['Department of Neuromedicine, National Institute of Occupational Health, Solna, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Solvents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Astrocytoma/epidemiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Film Dosimetry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00050866 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1993 Sep;4(5):465-76. doi: 10.1007/BF00050866.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
